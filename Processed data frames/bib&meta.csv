THESE CONCEPTIONS WERE GROUNDED IN OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SURFACE OR SHORELINE, AND IN PERIODS WHEN HUMAN ACTIVITIES IN THE OCEAN WERE MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY AND SPATIALLY LIMITED THAN THEY ARE TODAY. ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED HOW HUMANS INTERACT WITH AND ACCESS THE OCEAN, ALLOWING EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION OF OCEAN AREAS AND PROCESSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. THIS NEW CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND AND EXTRACT FROM THE OCEAN MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO PROFOUNDLY ALTER HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS TO IT AND CONCEPTIONS OF IT. AS PUBLIC SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT WITH MARINE CONSERVATION AND ‘BLUE ECONOMIES’ STEM FROM VALUE AND BELIEF SYSTEMS, FUTURE MARINE MANAGEMENT WILL BENEFIT FROM RECOGNIZING OUR HISTORICAL MARINE RELATIONSHIPS AS CONTEXT FOR CHANGES IN UNDERSTANDING, USE, AND THE INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION FACED BY THE OCEAN.

NAT.,"DUE TO THE STRONG INTERCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN THE OCEAN AND OUR SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, IMPROVED OCEAN GOVERNANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UN OCEAN DECADE. HOWEVER, A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES—ECOLOGICAL, SOCIETAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC—AND RELATIONS BETWEEN THESE HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION TO FOSTER TRANSFORMATIVE PATHWAYS TOWARDS MARINE SUSTAINABILITY. A CORE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE FACING IS THAT THE ‘RIGHT’ RESPONSE TO COMPLEX SOCIETAL ISSUES CANNOT BE KNOWN BEFOREHAND AS ABILITIES TO PREDICT COMPLEX SYSTEMS ARE LIMITED. CONSEQUENTLY, SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION IS NECESSARILY A JOURNEY TOWARDS THE UNKNOWN AND THEREFORE REQUIRES EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES THAT MUST ENABLE THE INVOLVEMENT OF EVERYONE WITH STAKES IN THE FUTURE OF OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND ITS RESOURCES. A PROMISING TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH METHOD THAT FULFILS BOTH CRITERIA—BEING PARTICIPATORY AND EXPERIMENTAL—ARE REAL-WORLD LABORATORIES. HERE, WE DISCUSS HOW REAL-WORLD LABS CAN SERVE AS AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OCEAN DECADE BY FACILITATING AND GUIDING SUCCESSFUL KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE AT THE INTERFACE OF SCIENCE AND SOCIETY. THE CORE ELEMENT OF REAL-WORLD LABS IS TRANSDISCIPLINARY EXPERIMENTATION TO JOINTLY DEVELOP POTENTIAL STRATEGIES LEADING TO TARGETED REAL-WORLD INTERVENTIONS, ESSENTIAL FOR ACHIEVING THE PROPOSED ‘DECADE OUTCOMES’. THE AUTHORS SPECIFICALLY ILLUSTRATE HOW DEPLOYING THE CONCEPT OF REAL-WORLD LABS CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS WHEN HAVING TO DEAL WITH MULTIPLE, OVERLAPPING CHALLENGES IN THE CONTEXT OF OCEAN GOVERNANCE AND THE BLUE ECONOMY. ALTOGETHER, WE OFFER A FIRST MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO SYNTHESIZING KNOWLEDGE ON THE POTENTIALS OF MARINE REAL-WORLD LABS, CONSIDERING HOW THEY ACT AS A WAY OF EXPLORING OPTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE OCEAN FUTURES. INDEED, IN THE MARINE CONTEXT, REAL-WORLD LABS ARE STILL UNDER-EXPLORED BUT ARE A TANGIBLE WAY FOR ADDRESSING THE SOCIETAL CHALLENGES OF WORKING TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY TRANSFORMATIONS OVER THE COMING UN OCEAN DECADE AND BEYOND.

IN SOUTH AFRICA, HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN A RELATIVE OVERSIGHT BY LOCAL TOURISM GEOGRAPHERS ON COASTAL DESTINATIONS. THE POLICY ENVIRONMENT CONCERNING COASTAL TOURISM IN SOUTH AFRICA IS CHANGING WITH NEW POLICY INTERVENTIONS AND DEBATES AROUND THE BLUE ECONOMY. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE CHAPTER PROVIDES AN EXAMINATION OF COASTAL TOURISM IN SOUTH AFRICA FROM A GEOGRAPHICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE STUDY IS THE FIRST TO MAP OUT THE SIZE, COMPLEXION AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF COASTAL TOURISM IN SOUTH AFRICA ON THE BASIS OF INVESTIGATING THE 15 DISTRICT AND METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITIES THAT ADJOIN THE NATIONAL COASTAL LINE. ARGUABLY, THE CONTRIBUTION OF COASTAL AREAS TO SOUTH AFRICA’S TOURISM ECONOMY IS IN RELATIVE DECLINE. EXISTING COASTAL TOURISM IS GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED UPON THE TWO MAJOR COASTAL METROPOLITAN AREAS. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIES ARE REVEALED FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOURISM, NAMELY LEISURE AS OPPOSED TO BUSINESS OR VFR TRAVEL AND FOR DOMESTIC AS OPPOSED TO INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. THE RESEARCH DISCLOSES THAT COASTAL TOURISM IS POLARIZING AND IS INCREASINGLY AN URBAN PHENOMENON IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE UNEVEN GEOGRAPHICAL IMPACTS OF COASTAL TOURISM RAISE A NUMBER OF POLICY CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEED FOR STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS TO SPREAD MORE WIDELY THE IMPACTS OF COASTAL TOURISM IN THE COUNTRY. © 2020, SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.",NA,"C.M.

SCI.,"THE “BLUE ECONOMY” HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A DRIVER OF EUROPEAN GROWTH, THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COMPETENCES AND ACTIVITIES THAT ENABLE A SUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF OCEAN RESOURCES. THIS PAPER CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE DIRECTIONS FOLLOWED BY THE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY PORTUGUESE ORGANISATIONS IN THE FIELDS ENCOMPASSED BY THE “BLUE ECONOMY”, AT THE LIGHT OF NATIONAL AND EU STRATEGIES. THE PAPER DRAWS ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECTS DEVELOPED BY PORTUGUESE ACTORS IN THE CONTEXT OF EUROPEAN FRAMEWORK PROGRAMMES TO INVESTIGATE: THE AREAS THAT ARE BEING PRIVILEGED AND THE ROLE AND POSITIONING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTORS IN THE DEVELOPMENTS TAKING PLACE. THE RESULTS POINT TO THE EMERGENCE OF NEW ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND MARINE RENEWABLE INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIONS IN ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES EXPLOITING MARINE LIVING RESOURCES (FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE). THEY LIKEWISE REVEAL THAT THE RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES TOWARDS THE REVITALISATION OF OTHER ESTABLISHED SEA-RELATED INDUSTRIES IS STILL VERY LIMITED. THE RESULTS ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE PROMINENT POSITION OF RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS IN BOTH NEW AND ESTABLISHED AREAS. BUT THEY EQUALLY UNCOVER THE RELEVANT POSITION OCCUPIED BY NEW TECHNOLOGY INTENSIVE FIRMS, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS THAT REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE APPLICATION ORIENTED METHODS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, WHERE THEY ARE OFTEN INVOLVED IN TRIPARTITE RELATIONSHIPS, INTERMEDIATING BETWEEN RESEARCH AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION.

IN 2017, IT ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY € 74.3 BILLION IN GROSS OPERATING PROFIT, AND AN ANNUAL TURNOVER OF APPROXIMATELY € 658 BILLION. AMONG ALL BLUE ECONOMIC SECTORS, CRUISE TOURISM IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES, WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION STILL ACCOUNTING FOR THE SECOND MOST POPULAR CRUISE DESTINATION IN THE WORLD, AFTER THE CARIBBEAN. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE CRUISE SECTOR TO THE LOCAL ECONOMIES OF MOST PORTS OF CALL HOWEVER, PROVES TO BE QUITE LIMITED, WITH NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OFTEN SURPASSING DERIVED BENEFITS. PROMOTING AND INTEGRATING ‘TRADITIONAL’ PRODUCTS INTO CRUISE SUPPLY CHAINS CAN BE A PROMISING SOLUTION ADDRESSING THIS SITUATION. IT MAY ALSO PROVIDE PASSENGERS WITH AN ENHANCED LOCAL-TASTING EXPERIENCE THAT MAY MAKE THEIR JOURNEY EVEN MORE MEMORABLE.

BY 2025 THE GLOBAL MARKET IS ESTIMATED TO REACH USD $30.2 BILLION DOLLARS (BLOOMBERG, SEAWEED CULTIVATION MARKET WORTH $30.2 BILLION BY 2025. RETRIEVED 06/08/2021, 2021, FROM , 2020). THE CURRENT AUSTRALIAN SEAWEED MARKET IS VALUED AT US$3 MILLION, WHICH IS RELATIVELY SMALL, CONTRIBUTING ONLY 0.03% TO THE GLOBAL MARKET. HOWEVER, THE BLUE ECONOMY CRC AND MARINE BIOPRODUCTS CRC TOGETHER HAVE RESULTED IN A PUBLIC/PRIVATE FUNDING OF NEARLY AUD $600 MILLION OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS WITH THE AIM OF EXPANDING TOWARDS A BILLION-DOLLAR SEAWEED MARKET IN AUSTRALIA WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE. FURTHERMORE, A RECENT CSIRO DATA 61 REPORT IDENTIFIED 'MICROALGAL AND MACROALGAL RESOURCES' AS AN EMERGING GROWTH SECTOR, SPECIFICALLY IN THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND (NAUGHTIN ET AL., A NEW CHAPTER: OPPORTUNITIES TO SEED NEW INDUSTRIES FOR QUEENSLAND OVER THE COMING DECADE. CSIRO AND QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA, PP 1-85, 2021). CURRENTLY, MOST OF THE SEAWEEDS ON THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET ARE IMPORTED, AND THIS SECTOR HAS SEEN A RAPID EXPANSION FROM 2005 TO 2017. THIS GROWTH HIGHLIGHTS THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR SEAWEED PRODUCTS IN AUSTRALIA AND POTENTIAL FOR THE EXPANSION OF DOMESTIC PRODUCERS. INTERNATIONAL SEAWEED MARKETS ARE ALSO EXPANDING RAPIDLY AT A RATE OF 12% AND SO OFFER SIGNIFICANT EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES (IMARC, SEAWEED MARKET: GLOBAL INDUSTRY TRENDS, SHARE, SIZE, GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND FORECAST 2021-2026. RETRIEVED 06/08/2021, 2021, FROM, 2021). DESPITE THE HUGE DOMESTIC BIODIVERSITY OF SEAWEEDS AND THEIR USE BY FIRST NATIONS PEOPLES, THE COMMERCIALISATION OF NATIVE SEAWEED PRODUCTS HAS BEEN LIMITED. TO DATE, SEAWEED CULTIVATION AND RESEARCH HAS BEEN BROADLY MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AQUACULTURE AND MARINE SCIENCES, AND MORE RECENTLY THIS HAS EXPANDED TO SPECIFIC ORGANISATIONS (E.G. CSIRO, AGRIFUTURES, ASI) AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES (E.G. THE COMBINED MARINE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH CENTERS (CRCS) HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR A TOTAL OF AUD $580 MILLION DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS FOR MARINE BIOPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND THE BLUE ECONOMY WITH A CONSORTIUM OF ~100 INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT AND RESEARCH PARTNERS). THESE COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS WITH SEAWEED PRODUCTION COMPANIES PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A GROWING INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR SEAWEED-BASED PRODUCTS IN AUSTRALIA AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE TWO MAJOR SEAWEEDS CULTIVATED IN AUSTRALIA TODAY COMPRISE DURVILLAEA POTATORUM AND UNDARIA PINNATIFIDA. D. POTATORUM (COMMONLY KNOWN AS BULL KELP) IS A NATIVE BROWN SEAWEED SPECIES, WHICH IS COLLECTED PRIMARILY ON KING ISLAND (TASMANIA). SUSTAINABLE HARVESTING BOTH GENERATES AN INCOME OF ABOUT AUD $2.63 MILLION ANNUALLY AND HELPS PRESERVE KELP FOREST ECOSYSTEMS, MOTIVATING FURTHER RESEARCH AND SUSTAINABLE CULTIVATION. BOTH SPECIES ARE WIDELY USED TO PRODUCE THICKENING AGENTS FOR THE FOOD AND COSMETICS INDUSTRY. IN QUEENSLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA THERE ARE CURRENTLY A NUMBER OF PROMISING SEAWEED-BASED RESEARCH PROJECTS DEVELOPING SEAWEED-BASED PRODUCTS RANGING FROM 3D BIO-PRINTING TECHNOLOGY, LIVESTOCK FEED (METHANE EMISSIONS MITIGATION) AND OPTIMISATION OF SEAWEED MARICULTURE SYSTEMS.

THE RESEARCH FOLLOWED AN EXPLORATORY AND DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH DESIGN WITHIN A POST-POSITIVISM PARADIGM. VIA PURPOSIVE SAMPLING, SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 34 DIVE OPERATORS FROM KENYA, TANZANIA, MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH AFRICA.

HOWEVER, THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPLY NATURAL GOODS AND SERVICES DEPENDS ON HOW WELL MARINE RESOURCES AND THEIR BIODIVERSITY ARE CONSERVED. IN SOUTH ASIA, THE CONSERVATION OF THESE RESOURCES AND THEIR BIODIVERSITY IS FAR FROM IDEAL. THIS IS BECAUSE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS ARE UNFAVOURABLE TO THE ADOPTION OF MEASURES REQUIRED TO CONSERVE THESE RESOURCES ADEQUATELY. AS IS EXPLAINED, THIS IS COMMON IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS THOSE IN SOUTH ASIA. MARINE PROTECTED AREAS ARE MAINLY ESTABLISHED TO PREVENT THE OVER-HARVESTING OF RESOURCES, BUT SOMETIMES THEY ARE COMPLETELY PROTECTED FROM HARVESTING ACTIVITIES. THEY ARE ONE OF THE MEANS AVAILABLE TO HELP CONSERVE MARINE BIODIVERSITY. THE COMPARATIVE EXTENT TO WHICH BANGLADESH, INDIA, PAKISTAN, SRI LANKA AND THE MALDIVES HAVE ESTABLISHED MARINE PROTECTED AREAS IS OUTLINED, AND THEIR MANAGEMENT OF THESE AREAS IS DISCUSSED. HOWEVER, OVER-HARVESTING OF MARINE RESOURCES IS NOT THE ONLY THREAT TO MARINE RESOURCES. MARINE POLLUTION IS ALSO A THREAT TO THEIR BIODIVERSITY AND TO THEIR SUSTAINABLE AND EFFICIENT USE. THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF MARINE POLLUTION IN SOUTH ASIAN MARITIME AREAS ARE INVESTIGATED WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION BEING GIVEN TO PLASTIC WASTES.

FIGURES SHOW A HIGH VALUE BUT THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDIES. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, THEIR IMPORTANCE IS CLEAR. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT THE TREND IS FOR A DECLINE IN MOST ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DERIVED FROM SUCH ECOSYSTEMS IN SPITE OF HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPLOITATION, BECAUSE OF THE DEGRADATION TO THE ECOSYSTEMS IN MANY LOCATIONS. THE CAUSES OF THE DEGRADATION ARE OVER EXPLOITATION, MISUSE OF THE MARINE BIOMES AS A WASTE SINK, CONVERSION OF COASTAL SYSTEMS, AND LOSS OF HABITAT AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS DEGRADATION IS NOT INEVITABLE AND CAN BE REVERSED. A KEY ROLE IN DOING SO IS TO ESTIMATE THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF MARINE-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND THE INCORPORATION OF THOSE COSTS IN SETTING REGULATIONS AND DESIGNING POLICIES TO MANAGE THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT. THE CHAPTER HAS REVIEWED A RANGE OF INSTRUMENTS, TO SEE HOW THEY CAN HELP TO MOVE THE USE OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS TOWARDS A MORE SUSTAINABLE USE. AT PRESENT, WHILE THERE ARE SOME DEVELOPMENTS THAT INDICATE A SHIFT IN A MORE ENCOURAGING DIRECTION, WE ALSO HAVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS, PARTICULARLY SOME SUBSIDIES THAT ARE HARMFUL TO THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT.

THIS WOULD HELP IN UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THE OBJECTIVES OF ENHANCED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH TRADE LIBERALIZATION. THE PAPER STUDIES THIS ASPECT USING SIMULATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IMPORTS AND OVERALL WELFARE MAY INCREASE DUE TO THE TRADE LIBERALIZATION BETWEEN IORA AND NON-IORA COUNTRIES IN THE BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS. THE ECONOMIES ACT POSITIVELY BY INCREASED ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS IN ORDER TO UTILIZE THE ABUNDANTLY AVAILABLE BLUE ECONOMY RESOURCES. IMPORT EXPANSION CAN BE AS HIGH AS HALF A PERCENT OF INITIAL IMPORTS IN SOME COUNTRIES. TRADE IMPACT IS MUCH MORE VISIBLE IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIAL SECTORS, THAN OTHERS.

HIGH-DENSITY POPULATION RESIDES IN COASTAL AND ISLANDIC REGIONS OF THESE COUNTRIES AND WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, RISING SEA LEVEL IS SEEN AN IMMINENT DANGER TO THE COASTAL COMMUNITY IN THE LOW-LYING AREA. TO COUNTER THE RISING SEA LEVEL, COUNTRIES ARE LOOKING FOR TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT THE DISPLACED COASTAL POPULATION BY EMBARKING ON FLOATING HOMES AND FLOATING CITIES IN THEIR BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY TO SUPPORT LIVING SPACE AND AMENITIES NEEDS. SINCE THESE FLOATING HOMES AND CITIES ARE POWERED THROUGH FOSSIL FUEL THERE IS A NEED TO PRESERVE THE COASTAL MARINE ECOLOGY FROM THE EMISSIONS. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES ABOUT POWERING THE FLOATING HOMES THROUGH OCEAN BASED FLOATING CLEAN ENERGY SYSTEMS AS A COST-EFFECTIVE ENERGY SYSTEM THAT CAN BE MANUFACTURED, ASSEMBLED AND MAINTAINED IN THE ONSHORE AND EASILY TOWED AND DEPLOYED AT A SPECIFIC OCEAN SITE AND ASSURE ENERGY SECURITY AND RESILIENCE EVEN DURING NATURAL DISASTERS.

CONSISTING OF THE OCEAN AND OCEAN-RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FISHERIES, PORT AND SHIPPING, DEEP SEA MINING, OCEAN ENERGY, COASTAL TOURISM, ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND MARINE SERVICES, IT OFFERS HUGE POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC EXPANSION. AS COUNTRIES COMPETE OVER FINITE LAND RESOURCES, THE NEXT COMPETITION AMONG COUNTRIES IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE DOMAIN OF OCEAN SECTOR. MOREOVER, MARITIME TRANSPORT CONTINUES TO REMAIN A CRUCIAL MEANS OF NAVIGATION AND TRADE. MANY ASIAN AND AFRICAN COASTAL NATIONS HAVE LONG COASTLINES AND LARGE COASTAL COMMUNITIES WHICH COULD PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED TRIGGER TO THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PLANNING FOR INVESTMENT, EMPLOYMENT, GROWTH AND NON-TRADITIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, KNOWLEDGE ABOUT POTENTIALS OF BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS IS PARAMOUNT. FOR THIS PURPOSE, UNDERSTANDING ABOUT ‘STYLISED FACTS’ OF THE BLUE ECONOMY IS NECESSARY WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE. SOME OF THE KEY SECTORS LINKED WITH FOOD SECURITY, NUTRITIONAL SECURITY AND LIVELIHOOD SECURITY LIKE THE FISHERY SECTOR IS ASSOCIATED WITH BLUE ECONOMY. EASTERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES SUCH AS KENYA, MADAGASCAR, MOZAMBIQUE, COMOROS AND OTHERS ARE LOCATED IN THE INDIAN OCEAN RIM. THEIR STRATEGIC LOCATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVIDES HUGE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNLEASHING THE POTENTIAL OF MARINE RESOURCES FOR THE EXPANSION OF BUSINESSES, PROMOTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP, INCREASING EXPORTS, CREATING JOBS, AND EMPOWERING THE NATIVE COASTAL COMMUNITIES. WITH GROWING AWARENESS ABOUT BLUE ECONOMY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES, IT CAN OFFER TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDE A NECESSARY TRIGGER TO THE GROWTH MOMENTUM. DESPITE LONG COASTLINES AND ENDOWMENT OF VARIOUS OCEAN RESOURCES, THE EASTERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE NOT YET OPTIMALLY HARNESSED THIS SECTOR FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL OBJECTIVES.

IN THIS STUDY, THE CONCEPT OF COUNTRY'S BLUE ECONOMY STATUS WAS TRANSFORMED INTO AN OPERATIONAL DEFINITION THROUGH COMPLEX NETWORK METHOD. CONSIDERING THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNAVOIDABLE SPATIAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN COUNTRIES IN BLUE PRODUCT TRADE, THE DOUBLE-FIXED SPATIAL DURBIN MODEL WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DIRECT EFFECT OF BLUE PRODUCT STRUCTURE ON THE PROMOTION OF COUNTRY'S BLUE ECONOMY STATUS AND THE SPATIAL SPILLOVER EFFECT ON SURROUNDING COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT: (1) THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES' BLUE ECONOMY STATUS, MEANING THAT COUNTRIES ARE NOT RANDOMLY INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY OTHER REGIONS. (2) CAPACITY ACCUMULATION, ADVANCED, DIVERSIFIED, AND RATIONALIZED BLUE PRODUCT STRUCTURE ALL CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE UPLIFT OF COUNTRY'S BLUE ECONOMY STATUS, BUT THESE FOUR BLUE PRODUCT STRUCTURES DIFFER GREATLY ON THE SPATIAL SPILLOVER EFFECT OF SURROUNDING AREAS. (3) THE RESULTS OF THE HETEROGENEITY ANALYSIS BASED ON INCOME LEVEL ALSO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN PREVIOUS STUDIES WHERE CONSISTENT CONCLUSIONS COULD NOT BE REACHED DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE SUBJECTS STUDIED.

WITH LIMITED SPACE AND DEGRADED RESOURCES IN COASTAL AREAS, OFFSHORE WATERS WILL BE A PARTICULAR FOCUS OF BLUE ECONOMY EXPANSION OVER THE NEXT DECADE. WHEN EMERGING AND ESTABLISHED ECONOMIC SECTORS EXPAND IN OFFSHORE WATERS (WITHIN NATIONAL EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES), DIFFERENT POTENTIAL BLUE ECONOMY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES WILL ARISE. FOLLOWING A SERIES OF INTERDISCIPLINARY WORKSHOPS, WE IMAGINE TWO TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE FUTURES FOR THE OFFSHORE BLUE ECONOMY AND WE IDENTIFY THE ACTIONS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE MORE SUSTAINABLE OUTCOME. UNDER A BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO THE FOCUS WILL REMAIN ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE COMMODIFICATION OF NATURE, THE DOMINANCE OF PRIVATE OVER PUBLIC AND CULTURAL INTERESTS, AND PRIORITISATION OF THE INTERESTS OF CURRENT OVER FUTURE GENERATIONS. A MORE SUSTAINABLE SCENARIO WOULD MEET MULTIPLE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND ENSURE INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND FAIR AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS USERS, NATIONS, AND GENERATIONS. CHALLENGES TO THIS MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE ARE A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT EMERGING OFFSHORE SECTORS, LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES, AND A LACK OF PLANNING AND GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT. ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES WILL REQUIRE A SHIFT IN SOCIETAL VALUES, A MORE BALANCED ALLOCATION OF FUNDING TO OFFSHORE ACTIVITIES, TRANSPARENCY IN INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN INDUSTRIES AND ACROSS NATIONS, AND ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS. THE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE OFFSHORE BLUE ECONOMY WE ENVISAGE IS ACHIEVABLE AND PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD GLOBAL CAPACITY AND PARTNERSHIP.

HOWEVER, DATA AND INFORMATION ON THE INTERACTIONS AMONG THESE FISHERIES AND THE ECOLOGY OF BILLFISH IN THE WIO ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. USING AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES, GREY LITERATURE, OBSERVATION STUDIES, AND AUTHORS’ INSIDER KNOWLEDGE, WE SUMMARIZE THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE ON BILLFISH FISHERIES IN 10 COUNTRIES. TO DESCRIBE HISTORICAL AND CURRENT TRENDS, WE EXAMINED FISHERIES STATISTICS FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, SPORTFISHING CLUBS’ REPORTS, DIARIES OF SPORTFISHING CAPTAINS, AND THE CATCH AND EFFORT DATABASES OF THE INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION. WE HIGHLIGHT TWO KEY POINTS. FIRST, BILLFISH FISHERIES IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ARE HIGHLY DIVERSE, COMPRISING TWO DISTINCT SEGMENTS—COASTAL AND OCEANIC. HOWEVER, DATA ARE POOR FOR MOST COUNTRIES WITH SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN INFORMATION ESPECIALLY FOR SPORT AND ARTISANAL FISHERIES. SECOND, THE EVIDENCE ASSEMBLED SHOWED THAT BILLFISH SPECIES HAVE IMMENSE SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC VALUE. SWORDFISH ARE TARGETED BY BOTH LARGE-SCALE AND SEMI-INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES, WHILE OTHER BILLFISH SPECIES, PARTICULARLY MARLIN, ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER BY SPORT FISHERIES IN MOST COUNTRIES.

A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF FISH WASTE IS PRODUCED IN WET MARKETS WHERE BULK OF FISH PRODUCTS ARE SOLD. A COMPARISON OF EXISTING PRACTICES IN DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES CAN INDICATE THE BEST POINTS OF INTERVENTION AND IDENTIFY EXISTING TRADITIONAL PRACTICES THAT CAN BE PROMOTED. THIS STUDY INTERVIEWED STAKEHOLDERS OF THE FISHERIES INDUSTRY AND COLLECTED INFORMATION AT THE MARKET LEVEL TO DETERMINE EXISTING FISH WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. FROM THE RESPONSES GATHERED, THE AVERAGE DAILY PRODUCTION OF FISH WASTE IN PHILIPPINE WET MARKETS WAS 70.3 + 0.93 KG, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ACROSS LOCATIONS (P = 0.2501). OF THE FISH WASTE PRODUCED, 32.3 + 1.33 KG PER WET MARKET WERE DISPOSED OF, 18.9 + 0.81 KG WERE SOLD, AND 19.1 + 1.15 KG WERE GIVEN AWAY TO STAKEHOLDERS WHO RE-USE THE FISH WASTE. A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF FISH WASTE IN RURAL AREAS WERE RE-USED COMPARED TO METRO MANILA (P = 0.0311).

THE ECONOMY OF MOROCCO DEPENDS MAINLY ON MARINE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FISHERIES, TOURISM, AND MARITIME TRADE. THESE SECTORS WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MAIN IN-SITU SOURCES OF PLASTICS ENTERING MOROCCAN COASTAL WATERS. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INCREASING ABUNDANCE OF PLASTICS IN SUCH MARINE SYSTEMS CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC LOSS TO BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES. IN CONTRAST, THE LACK OF DATA ON THE PLASTIC WASTE QUANTITY ENTERING MOROCCAN WATER IS A LIMITING FACTOR FOR ASSESSING PLASTIC POLLUTION. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A RISK ASSESSMENT AND MORE FIELD INVESTIGATIONS TO VALUE THE WEIGHT IMPACTS OF MARINE ACTIVITIES GENERATORS OF PLASTICS ON BIODIVERSITY AND THE ECONOMY.

THE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL FLEET LED TO AN INITIAL INCREASE IN GLOBAL CATCHES FROM THE 1950S TO THE 1990S; YET, TODAY, SEVERAL MARINE FISH STOCKS ARE HARVESTED AT UNSUSTAINABLE RATES, AND CATCHES ARE STAGNATING. AS A RESULT, INDUSTRIAL FISHERS INCREASE INVESTMENTS AND FISHING EFFORT, REACHING FARTHER AND DEEPER, WHILE SMALL-SCALE FISHERS FACE THE THREAT OF DISAPPEARANCE AS BOTH THEIR CATCHES AND LIVELIHOODS WORSEN. THE EMERGENT INTERNATIONAL EMPHASIS ON BLUE GROWTH IS LIKELY TO PUT FURTHER PRESSURE ON MARINE CAPTURE FISHERIES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW THE GROWTH IMPERATIVE IN THE SEAS HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF IN TURKEY SINCE THE 1970S AND HOW INDUSTRIAL AND SMALL-SCALE FISHERS RESPONDED TO THIS GROWTH SPIRAL IN THE SEAS. BASED ON PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION METHODS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, THIS PAPER PROBLEMATIZES THE EXPANDING BOUNDARIES OF INDUSTRIAL FISHERS AND EXAMINES THE REACTIONS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHING COOPERATIVES IN ISTANBUL, IN PARTICULAR THEIR PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC MODEL, AS A RESPONSE TO THE GROWTH IMPERATIVE. OVERALL, THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CRISIS THAT SMALL-SCALE FISHERS ARE FACING NOT ONLY PRESENTS ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES, BUT ALSO REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE IDENTITY AND TRADITIONAL WAYS OF LIFE AS A FISHER. THE STRATEGIES ADOPTED BY SMALL-SCALE FISHERS IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS IN TURKEY, ESPECIALLY IN ISTANBUL, ARE POLITICIZING FISHERS AS THEY OPEN UP NEW SPACES, COLLABORATIONS, AND DEMANDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. HOWEVER, THEIR EFFORTS CONSTITUTE AN ONGOING PROCESS PRONE TO NUMEROUS TENSIONS AND CONTRADICTIONS.

MAJOR COMMERCIAL PORTS ARE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO TRANSNATIONAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, ENABLING THE CIRCULATION OF MASSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY AND MATERIALS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. PORT ACTIVITY AND DEVELOPMENT ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS, SUCH AS INCREASED GDP AND EMPLOYMENT, BUT THE INDUSTRY’S CONTINUOUS EXPANSION PRODUCES ADVERSE OUTCOMES INCLUDING AIR AND WATER POLLUTION, THE DESTRUCTION OF MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS, WATERFRONT CONGESTION, HEALTH RISKS, AND LABOR ISSUES. IN ITS QUEST TO MARRY ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRIES, PROPONENTS OF THE NEWLY COINED BLUE GROWTH PARADIGM ASSUME THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF PORTS AND SHIPPING TO BE FIXABLE MOSTLY THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. THIS PAPER QUESTIONS THE VALIDITY OF THE PREMISE THAT THE UNLIMITED GROWTH OF THE PORT AND SHIPPING INDUSTRIES IS COMPATIBLE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND ANALYSES THE FEASIBILITY OF TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO OFFSET THE SECTOR’S ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE IMPACTS. BASED ON INSIGHTS FROM ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL ECOLOGY, PORTS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS POWER-LADEN ASSEMBLAGES OF SPACES, FLOWS, AND ACTORS, WHICH PRODUCE UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS AND BURDENS AT MULTIPLE SCALES.

REFRAMING IT AS A ‘BLUE FIX’, WE ARGUE THAT THE BLUE GROWTH DISCOURSE FACILITATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAPITAL ACCUMULATION, WHILE CLAIMING THAT THIS ACCUMULATION IS COMPATIBLE WITH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL AIMS AS WELL. THE BLUE FIX IS MADE UP OF THREE UNDERLYING SUB-FIXES. FIRST OF ALL, THE CONSERVATION FIX QUENCHES THE SOCIAL THIRST FOR ACTION IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HERE WE SEE HOW PROTECTING MARINE AREAS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT IN PRACTICE, GAINS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARE OVERSHADOWED BY THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF OFFSHORE DRILLING FOR OIL AND GAS. SECOND, THE PROTEIN FIX SATISFIES THE GROWING GLOBAL DEMAND FOR HEALTHY FOOD AND NUTRITION THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF CAPITAL-INTENSIVE LARGE-SCALE AQUACULTURE, WHILE IGNORING THE NEGATIVE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS, WHICH EFFECTIVELY SQUEEZE SMALL-SCALE CAPTURE FISHING OUT, WHILE INDUSTRIAL CAPTURE FISHING REMAINS WELL POSITIONED TO EXPAND INTO AS WELL AS SUPPLY INDUSTRIAL AQUACULTURE WITH FISH FEED FROM PELAGIC FISH. AND THIRD, AN ENERGY FIX OFFERS A BURST OF WIND ENERGY AND A SPLASH OF NEW DEEP-SEA MINERALS WITHOUT DISTURBING THE FAMILIAR AND PERSISTENT FOUNDATION OF OIL AND GAS. THIS DIMENSION OF THE BLUE FIX EMPHASIZES THE TRANSITION TO WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY, BUT MEANWHILE THE DEEP SEA MINING FOR MINERALS REQUIRED BY THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES LAUNCHES US INTO UNKNOWN ECOLOGICAL TERRITORIES WITH LITTLE UNDERSTOOD CONSEQUENCES. THE SYNERGY OF THESE THREE ELEMENTS BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A REFRAMING OF OCEAN POLITICS MANIFESTS AS A BALANCING ACT TO FRAME BLUE GROWTH AS ‘SUSTAINABLE’ AND IN EVERYONE’S INTEREST, WHICH WE CRITICALLY ANALYZE AND DISCUSS IN THIS ARTICLE. © 2020, SPRINGER JAPAN KK, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",NA,"Z.W.

POST-HARVEST INTERVENTIONS IN FISHERIES ENABLE FISHERS AND FISH PROCESSORS TO REDUCE WASTE, MAINTAIN NUTRITIONAL ASPECTS AND MEET STRINGENT DEMANDS IN FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY. THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE BENEFITS AND PITFALLS OF VARIOUS FISH POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS IN ORDER TO DRIVE POLICY DIALOGUE AND FORMULATION OF A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE INTERVENTIONS. IT RELIES ON DATA OBTAINED FROM THE KENYA MARINE AND FISHERIES RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND BLUE ECONOMY. RESULTS DEPICT ABUNDANT INTERVENTIONS IN BOTH HANDLING AND PROCESSING, BUT LOW UTILIZATION (<40% OF INSTALLED COLD ROOMS, DRYERS AND SMOKING KILNS) AND MULTIPLICATION BY FISHING COMMUNITIES. FISH PRODUCTS THAT TARGET EXPORT MARKETS HAVE WELL-ORGANIZED STRUCTURES. HOWEVER, A WEAK REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS A KEY CONSTRAINT IN ADDRESSING POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT OF FISH INTENDED FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET. UNDER-UTILIZATION OF INSTALLED INTERVENTIONS RESULTS IN CONTINUED WASTE OF FISH, CONTRIBUTING TO FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL INSECURITY. THIS REVIEW RECOMMENDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE AND INTEGRATIVE POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT INVOLVES INTERACTIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT DOMAINS, INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS THAT MONITOR AND ADDRESS THOSE INTERACTIONS, ANALYTICAL BASES FOR DECISION MAKING, AND MULTI-STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE FOR POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT.

STUD.,"THE LANGUAGE AND PRACTICE OF MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP) IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH STATE-LED MULTI-SECTORAL PLANNING EFFORTS. YET IN COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT YET PROMOTING MSP, OCEAN SPACE HAS ALREADY BEEN DIVIDED USING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF MSP ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. INSTEAD OF BEING INITIATED BY THE STATE, THESE MSP-LIKE PROCESSES ARE INITIATED BY INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES WHEN INDUSTRIES SEEK LARGE-SCALE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIA’S MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH INTENDED AS AN INCLUSIVE, HOLISTIC PROCESS TO PLAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, THIS ASSEMBLAGE OF MSP TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES, AND PRACTICES MANDATED BY INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS PRODUCES A PARTICULAR POWER RELATION THROUGH ITS REJECTION OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND INSISTENCE ON DATA, FOR INSTANCE, IN THE FORM OF DISCRETE, GEO-CODED POLYGONS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THIS FORM OF MSP PRODUCES AN ONTOLOGICAL POLITICS, DESPITE EMERGING FROM SEEMINGLY RATIONAL, POST-POLITICAL, AND TECHNOCRATIC PROCESSES. ENGAGING WITH SUCH POLITICS IS INCREASINGLY POSSIBLE WITH ACCESS TO GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND THIS, THEREFORE, PROVIDES A NOVEL SPACE IN WHICH TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL STRUGGLE. THE CASE OF EXTERNALLY MANDATED MSP IN INDIA DEMONSTRATES THAT NON-STATE ACTORS CAN INITIATE MSP, AND THEREFORE, OPENS THE POSSIBILITY FOR FISHING COMMUNITIES, AS NON-STATE ACTORS, TO DIRECTLY ENGAGE WITH THE ASSEMBLAGE OF PRACTICES THAT PRODUCE MSP. © 2020, SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",NA,"D.

WHILE GLOBAL AND NATIONAL POLICIES HAVE SPENT DECADES ADDRESSING COASTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, BROADER BLUE ECONOMY DISCOURSES AND PRACTICES SEEM, ON THE SURFACE, TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH STRATEGIES FOR MARINE CONSERVATION. INCREASINGLY, NEW MARKET-ORIENTED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS AIM TO TAP THE FINANCIAL VALUE OF THE OCEAN’S ‘BLUE CAPITAL’, OSTENSIBLY FOSTERING INCOME GENERATION AND SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS FOR CONSERVATION FINANCE.

ISLANDS OF THE SAME ARCHIPELAGO HAVE FACED VARIOUS CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF TOURISM GROWTH AND RELATED IMPACT. PRIMARILY, TOURISM HAS BEEN CHARACTERISED BY SEASONALITY (THE STRONG SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONCENTRATION OF TOURISTS IN A DESTINATION) ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST PERIPHERAL ISLANDS. IN OTHER CASES, TOURISM HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY RESULTING IN OVEREMPHASIS ON MASS TOURISM THROUGHOUT PART OF THE YEAR. THIS IS LARGELY EXPERIENCED DUE TO SAND, SUN AND SEA (3S) TOURISM. FIELDWORK, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND ECOTOURS OFF-SEASON, WAS CONDUCTED IN THE AEGADIAN ARCHIPELAGO, OFF THE WEST COAST OF SICILY.

STUD.,"THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT HAS DRAWN GLOBAL ATTENTION TO THE MARITIME ECONOMY, RECOGNISING EXPANDING MARITIME INDUSTRIES SUCH AS SHIPPING AS CRUCIAL DRIVERS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN RECENT DECADES, SEAPORTS HAVE CORRESPONDINGLY WITNESSED SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION, ALLOWING THEM TO PLAY A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN ACHIEVING BLUE GROWTH. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES FACED BY SMALL-SCALE FISHING ACTORS IN GAINING ACCESS TO FISHING LIVELIHOODS IN COASTAL FISHING COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO GHANAIAN PORTS. DRAWING ON POLITICAL ECOLOGY, THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES HOW SECURITISATION IN PORT AREAS AND DISPOSSESSION HAS RESULTED IN UNSTABLE FISHING LIVELIHOODS IN PORT COMMUNITIES. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE GROWTH-ORIENTED GOALS OF PORT EXPANSIONS AND PORT SECURITY MEASURES HAVE RESTRICTED FISHING COMMUNITIES’ ACCESS TO COASTAL FISHING SPACES AND CAUSED CONGESTION IN THE CANOE BAYS OF GHANA’S FISHING HARBOURS. IN ADDITION, THE URBANISATION AROUND THE PORTS HAS IMPACTED FISHERS’ ABILITY TO MEET THE RISING COST OF LIVING IN FISHING COMMUNITIES WITH FISHING INCOMES. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY DISCUSSES HOW THE NEW JAMESTOWN FISHING HARBOUR COMPLEX PROJECT HAS DISPLACED SMALL-SCALE FISHING ACTORS AND BECOME A SITE OF CONTESTATION BETWEEN A COASTAL FISHING COMMUNITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. IN CONCLUSION, AS COASTAL FISHING ACTORS LOSE THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD, RESISTANCE MAY ESCALATE INTO DIFFERENT FORMS OF MARITIME CONFLICTS IN THE BLUE ECONOMY.

SCI.,"THE MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCES OF THE WEST AFRICA REGION CONTRIBUTE IMMENSELY TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AS WELL AS TO THE ECONOMIES OF COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. THE REGION BOASTS OF TWO VIBRANT LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS (LMES), NAMELY THE CANARY CURRENT LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEM (CCLME) AND THE GUINEA CURRENT LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEM (GCLME), WHICH PROVIDE VAST FISHERIES AND OTHER MARINE RESOURCES. THE REGION AND ITS MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCES ARE HOWEVER FACED WITH DIVERSE THREATS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, DESTRUCTION OF MANGROVES, OVERFISHING, HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND COASTAL EROSION, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SEVERAL INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THIS PAPER REVIEWS SOME OF THE PAST AS WELL AS ONGOING INITIATIVES THAT ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES IN THE MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENT OF WEST AFRICA. AMONG THESE INITIATIVES IS THE GLOBAL MONITORING FOR ENVIRONMENT AND SECURITY (GMES) AND AFRICA PROGRAMME WHICH USES EARTH OBSERVATION (EO) DATA AND DERIVED INFORMATION TO MANAGE MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCES, WITH FOCUS ON THE “MARINE AND COASTAL AREAS MANAGEMENT IN WESTERN AFRICA” THEME IMPLEMENTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF GHANA (UG). THE REGIONAL MARINE CENTRE (RMC) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GHANA, WHICH SERVES AS THE REGIONAL IMPLEMENTATION CENTRE FOR THE GMES AND AFRICA MARINE PROGRAMME FOR WEST AFRICA, USES SENTINEL-1 SATELLITE DATA TO MONITOR SHORELINE CHANGE. THIS INFORMATION IS COMBINED WITH OTHER DATASETS TO GENERATE COASTAL VULNERABILITY INDICES (CVI) MAP FOR EROSION HOTSPOTS IN THE REGION, WHICH DIRECTLY FEEDS INTO POLICY INITIATIVES TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF COASTAL EROSION IN THE REGION. THIS, AS A RESULT, CONTRIBUTES TO BUILDING COASTAL RESILIENCE AND ALLEVIATING THE SEVERE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE WEST AFRICA COAST, AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE BLUE ECONOMY AGENDA. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.",NA,"B.A.K.

THIS CHAPTER IS STRUCTURED IN FOUR MAIN SECTIONS AND TAKES A MACROECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE TO EXPLORE THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALGAE AND SEAWEEDS TO SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN THE FIRST SECTION, THE CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS OF BIOECONOMY, BLUE ECONOMY, AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY ARE INTRODUCED. THESE CONCEPTS PARTICULARLY FIT THE CONTEXT IN WHICH ALGAE AND SEAWEED PRODUCTS ARE DEVELOPED, AS THEY ARE SUSTAINABLY SOURCED AND THEY ENTER VARIED INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AS INTERMEDIATE INPUTS OR BY-PRODUCTS. THE SECOND SECTION PRESENTS THE COMPLEX PORTFOLIO OF CURRENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF ALGAE AND SEAWEEDS ACROSS AND BETWEEN MAIN INDUSTRIAL SECTORS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CURRENT PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM ALGAE AND SEAWEEDS CONSIST OF HIGH-VALUE COMPOUNDS FOR FOOD, FEED, PHARMACEUTICALS, AND COSMECEUTICALS, BUT INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS FOR BIOFUELS, BIOFERTILIZERS, AND GREEN CHEMICALS ARE RAPIDLY EVOLVING. THE THIRD SECTION DISCUSSES THE SUPPLY CHAIN CHARACTERISTICS, THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION, AND THE MARKET CONTEXT IN WHICH PRODUCERS OF ALGAE BIOMASS AND PRODUCTS OPERATE. THE FOURTH SECTION PRESENTS MACROECONOMIC DATA AND INDICATORS OF PRODUCTION, TRADE, AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE OF ALGAE PRODUCTS AND BIOMASS. THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC DATA IS QUITE LIMITED. THE EU IS CURRENTLY THE MAIN PROVIDER OF DATA DUE TO ITS BIOECONOMY STRATEGY, R&D INVESTMENTS, AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN PRODUCING ALGAE AND SEAWEED PRODUCTS.

SEAWEED PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE BLUE ECONOMY AS A SOURCE OF FOOD, FEED, AND FEEDSTOCK FOR BIOREFINERIES. TODAY, THE LARGEST PART OF GLOBAL SEAWEED PRODUCTION IS BASED IN ASIA, BUT THERE IS ALSO A GROWING INTEREST IN SEAWEED PRODUCTION IN EUROPE. HOWEVER, MORE KNOWLEDGE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IS NEEDED TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF THE SECTOR. SEAWEED CAN BE USED IN BIOREFINERIES TO PRODUCE A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS FOR FOOD AND NON-FOOD APPLICATIONS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO PERFORM A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) OF A SEAWEED VALUE-CHAIN, INCLUDING SEAWEED CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION INTO SODIUM ALGINATE, BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS, BIOGAS, AND FERTILIZER IN A BIOREFINERY SETTING. THE LCA INCLUDED 19 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES BUT FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE. THE SEAWEED SACCHARINA LATISSIMA WAS CULTIVATED AND PROCESSED IN IRELAND. SODIUM ALGINATE WAS THEN EXTRACTED BY MEANS OF ULTRASOUND-ASSISTED EXTRACTION, A NOVEL EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY. CELLULOSIC RESIDUES PRODUCED AFTER THE EXTRACTION WERE USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FILMS USED AS A PACKAGING MATERIAL. RESIDUES THAT REMAIN AFTER THE PRODUCTION OF THE FILMS WERE SENT TO ANAEROBIC DIGESTION TO ACHIEVE A NO-WASTE CONCEPT. FOR SEAWEED CULTIVATION, FUEL USE AND DRYING OF SEAWEED BIOMASS WERE THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL HOT SPOTS; AND FOR THE ALGINATE EXTRACTION PROCESS, THE YIELD AND PURIFICATION AFTER EXTRACTION WERE THE MAIN HOT SPOTS.

A TYPICAL ASSUMPTION OF EXISTING TECHNO-ECONOMIC MODELS OF TIDAL ENERGY CONVERTER (TEC) ARRAYS IS THAT TECS POSITIONED TO MINIMISE NEGATIVE HYDRODYNAMIC INTERACTIONS WILL MAXIMISE ECONOMIC RETURN. THAT THE NUMBER OF TECS WITHIN AN ARRAY SHOULD BE CHOSEN TO MAXIMISE THE ANNUAL ENERGY PRODUCTION, FOLLOWS FROM THIS ASSUMPTION. TO EXAMINE THE VALIDITY OF THESE ASSERTIONS FOR SMALL, AREA-CONSTRAINED ARRAYS, A HYPOTHETICAL MODEL OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LEVELISED COST OF ENERGY (LCOE) TO THE MEAN MECHANICAL ANNUAL ENERGY PRODUCTION (MMAEP) IS DEVELOPED. THE MODEL EXHIBITS THREE CLASSES OF BEHAVIOUR, DETERMINED BY THE RATE OF ENERGY LOST TO INTERACTIONS AS TECS ARE ADDED TO AN OPTIMALLY POSITIONED ARRAY; SIGNIFICANTLY, ONLY ONE CLASS HAS GREATEST MMAEP CORRESPONDING TO LOWEST LCOE. TO TEST THIS MODEL, A CONTEMPORARY OPTIMISATION ALGORITHM IS ADDED TO THE ADVANCED OCEAN ENERGY TECHNO-ECONOMIC SIMULATION TOOL ‘DTOCEAN’ AND APPLIED TO ARRAYS OF TECS CONSTRAINED BY A 2HA DEPLOYMENT AREA. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE HYPOTHETICAL LCOE MODEL ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE DTOCEAN RESULTS UP TO AND INCLUDING 12 TECS DEPLOYED. AT 13 TECS DEPLOYED, THE LEVEL OF TEC INTERACTION INCREASES DRAMATICALLY, INVALIDATING THE HYPOTHETICAL MODEL. NOTABLY, HOWEVER, THE LCOE IS SHOWN TO REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY BY ALLOWING NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TECS, REDUCING BY 47.8% FROM THE BEST NON-INTERACTING ARRAY. THUS, SUBJECT TO AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT, TEC RELIABILITY AND COSTS, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALLOWING NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TECS MAY INCREASE THE ECONOMICALLY EXTRACTABLE RESOURCE OF SMALL AREA-CONSTRAINED TIDAL ENERGY SITES. © 2021 THE AUTHORS",APEND,"M.B.R.

THE SALMON OIL EXTRACTION PROCESS USING THE IMMOBILIZED ALCALASE WAS OPTIMIZED THROUGH A FACTORIAL DESIGN, AND THE HIGHEST OIL YIELD OF 20.55% (88.30% RECOVERY) WAS OBTAINED FROM 1 H OF HYDROLYSIS AT 65 °C. THE OIL RECOVERY USING THE IMMOBILIZED ALCALASE WAS COMPARABLE TO THE USE OF FREE ALCALASE. THE LOW LEVELS OF OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS INDICATED THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE EXTRACTED OIL, WHICH IS PROMISING TO BE PROCESSED INTO HIGH-VALUE PRODUCTS SUCH AS NUTRACEUTICALS AND PHARMACEUTICALS. THE IMMOBILIZED ALCALASE WAS COLLECTED USING A MAGNET AND REUSED AT LEAST THREE BATCHES WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN OIL YIELD, INDICATING ITS POTENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVE AND CONSECUTIVE OIL EXTRACTION FROM SALMON BY-PRODUCTS.

LIKE THE NATION AS A WHOLE, CALIFORNIA RELIES ON TRADE FOR SEAFOOD, WHICH CAN HAVE EFFECTS ON LIVELIHOODS, FOOD SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. EXPANDING AQUACULTURE COULD CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD SUPPLY AND SECURITY AND PROVIDE A MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY TO PRODUCE FOOD IN THE FUTURE. THE UNITED STATES HAS RECENTLY EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN INCREASING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF SEAFOOD, IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER PROMOTING AMERICAN SEAFOOD COMPETITIVENESS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, WITH THE DIRECT DESIRED RESULTS OF INCREASED LOCAL AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD, DECREASED FOREIGN DEPENDENCE, AND INCREASED JOBS. CALIFORNIA IS RE-EXAMINING ITS SEAFOOD SECTOR AND NEEDS TO RECONCILE DISPARITIES IN PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION AS THE STATE NAVIGATES A CHANGING SEAFOOD LANDSCAPE. UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT SEAFOOD LANDSCAPE IS NECESSARY FOR MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS TO SECURE A RESILIENT, SUSTAINABLE, AND EQUITABLE SEAFOOD SECTOR. TO REFLECT THE GOALS RECENTLY STATED IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER, WE ASK 1) WHAT IS THE STATE OF SEAFOOD PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA, 2) WHAT IS THE TRADE LANDSCAPE FOR SEAFOOD WITHIN CALIFORNIA, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL, AND 3) HOW HAVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED THIS INTERACTION BETWEEN PRODUCTION, TRADE, AND CONSUMPTION, THROUGH THE LENS OF EMPLOYMENT. WE FIND CALIFORNIA CONSUMES UPWARD OF THREE TIMES MORE SEAFOOD THAN IT PRODUCES BY VOLUME, AND RELIES HEAVILY ON INTERNATIONAL IMPORTS TO MAKE UP THE PRODUCTION GAP, WITH ROUGHLY HALF OF IMPORTED PRODUCTION LIKELY COMING FROM AQUACULTURE. THIS RELIANCE HAS RADIATING EFFECTS, SUCH AS DISPLACEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN TO OTHER, OFTEN POORER AND LESS REGULATED COUNTRIES, AND TO PLACES WHERE SEAFOOD PRODUCTION IS LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WILD CAPTURE IS UNLIKELY TO INCREASE, SO ANY INCREASE IN DOMESTIC PRODUCTION WILL COME FROM AQUACULTURE. TO MEET THIS CALL, CALIFORNIA HAS A CHOICE ALONG A SPECTRUM OF INCREASED STATE PRODUCTION VIA AQUACULTURE OR INCREASED DEPENDENCE ON AQUACULTURED IMPORTS, BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.

ENG.,"THE WIDE APPLICATION OF MICROALGAE IN HEALTH FOODS, NUTRITIONAL FEEDS, AQUACULTURE, PHARMACEUTICAL EXTRACTS, AND BIOFUEL PRODUCTION, HAS BROUGHT ABOUT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION INDUSTRY. HOWEVER, COMMERCIAL-SCALE CULTIVATION OF MICROALGAE STILL FACES ONE MAJOR CHALLENGE, WHICH IS ITS ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY, WITH LOWER COST AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION. DEVELOPING FLOATING PHOTOBIOREACTORS TO BE UTILIZED IN OFFSHORE OPEN WATER AREAS HAS GAINED MORE INTEREST RECENTLY AS IT CAN DIMINISH THE COST EFFECTS OF ONSHORE LAND UTILIZATION, WHILE SEEKING FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS, SUCH AS REGULATED TEMPERATURE, PROXIMITY TO SUNLIGHT AND NUTRIENT SUPPLIES, AND INTEGRATED OCEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. THEREBY, THIS IS TIMELY TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF FLOATING PHOTOBIOREACTORS FOR MICROALGAE CULTIVATION IN THE OFFSHORE REGION. THIS REVIEW DELIBERATELY PRESENTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSHORE ENVIRONMENTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON MICROALGAE CULTIVATION, AS FACTORS SUCH AS LOCATION SELECTION, HEAT CAPACITY, AND UTILIZATION OF CULTIVATION RESOURCES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM CONVENTIONAL LAND-BASED CULTIVATION. COMPARED TO LAND-BASED PHOTOBIOREACTORS, THE DESIGN OF FLOATING PHOTOBIOREACTORS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT HYDRODYNAMICAL DESIGN; BY UTILIZING THE EXTERNAL FORCE FROM OCEAN WAVES TO GENERATE INTERNAL LIQUID SLOSHING FOR IMPROVING THE MIXING OF CULTIVATION MEDIUM. WHILE OFFSHORE-BASED MICROALGAE CULTIVATION IS CONSIDERABLY NEW AS PART OF BLUE ECONOMY AND MARICULTURE, THIS REVIEW PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER ADVANCEMENT OF OFFSHORE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION TECHNOLOGIES. THE ENCOURAGING FACTORS FOR HYBRIDIZATION OF OFFSHORE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION INCLUDE MARICULTURE, CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND UTILIZATION, HYDROGEN PRODUCTION, AND OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY. SUCH UNDERSTANDINGS ARE VITAL TO IMPROVING MICROALGAE CULTIVATION IN OFFSHORE FLOATING PHOTOBIOREACTORS TOWARDS A VALUABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT CONCERNS IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL SCALE OF THE MICROALGAE INDUSTRY.

CONSERV.,"TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF OCEAN-BASED ECONOMIES, MANY COUNTRIES ARE ENGAGING IN MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP) PROCESSES, WHICH REQUIRE ROBUST DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS. SYSTEMATIC CONSERVATION PLANNING (SCP) IS COMMONLY USED IN DECISION-MAKING TO GUIDE SPATIALLY EFFICIENT PROTECTED AREA EXPANSION. HERE WE CONTEND THAT SCP CAN ALSO BE USED TO STREAMLINE MSP NEGOTIATIONS BY DEVELOPING A COHERENT, INTEGRATED PORTFOLIO OF SITES FOR MULTIPLE SECTORS THAT DEPEND ON BIODIVERSITY BEING MAINTAINED IN A GOOD STATE, AS A COUNTERPOINT TO SPATIAL PRIORITIES FOR THOSE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. WE DEMONSTRATE THIS IN ALGOA BAY, SOUTH AFRICA, GIVEN THE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE BAY, AND ITS CENTRAL LOCATION IN THE FIRST NATIONAL MSP PROCESS. IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS NATIONAL PROCESS, A CIVIL-SOCIETY-LED COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WAS ESTABLISHED WITH A CORE TEAM TO LEAD STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, DATA ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT, AND SCP ANALYSES. MORE THAN 500 STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATED IN THE PROJECT AND MANY CONTRIBUTED SPATIAL DATA OR ENGAGED IN EXPERT-BASED PARTICIPATORY MAPPING. SPATIAL PRODUCTS WERE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXISTING, PUBLISHED DATASETS. ALTOGETHER, CONSERVATION TARGETS WERE SET FOR 115 BIODIVERSITY FEATURES AND 22 NATURE-BASED ACTIVITIES, WITH THE COST LAYER BUILT FROM DATA ON 10 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES, CUMULATIVE PRESSURES (N = 31) ON ECOSYSTEMS, AND PLANNING-UNIT AREA. ALL TARGETS WERE MET IN 15% OF THE STUDY AREA, OF WHICH ONLY A THIRD (4%) WAS OUTSIDE OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS, DEMONSTRATING THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ALIGN MULTI-SECTOR PRIORITIES FOR INTACT BIODIVERSITY.

REDUCING FISHERIES' IMPACTS ON MARINE MEGAFAUNA IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IN SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSFS), WHERE ENDANGERED SPECIES CAN HAVE IMPORTANT CONSUMPTIVE USE VALUES. PAYMENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (PES) HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION, BUT THERE IS A LACK OF EMPIRICAL DATA ON IF AND HOW THEY MIGHT WORK IN THIS CONTEXT. WE PRESENT A NOVEL COMBINATION OF METHODS – SCENARIO INTERVIEWS WITH CONTINGENT VALUATION (CV) – FOR EXPLORING AND DESIGNING LOCALLY-APPROPRIATE PES SCHEMES; AND APPLY THESE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCENTIVES MIGHT INFLUENCE FISHER BEHAVIOUR AND MORTALITY OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED TAXA IN TWO CASE STUDY SSFS IN INDONESIA.

AT THE SAME TIME, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION OF VALUE ADDED FISHERY PRODUCTS GENERATES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NUTRIENT-RICH DISCARDS, BESIDES VOLUMINOUS AMOUNT OF PROCESS EFFLUENTS. THESE DISCARDS, BY-CATCH AND EFFLUENTS ARE RICH SOURCES OF NUTRIENTS, INDUSTRIALLY IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS AND ALSO BIO-ENERGY. DEVELOPMENTS IN MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY OFFER NOVEL ECO- FRIENDLY GREEN PROCESSES FOR BIO-REFINING OF DISCARDED SEAFOOD PORTIONS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES POTENTIALS OF GREEN PROCESSING FOR THE VALORIZATION OF SEAFOOD DISCARDS AND PROCESS EFFLUENTS TOWARDS ZERO WASTE THAT CAN IMPROVE SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN. THE GREEN PROCESSES GENERALLY MAKE USE OF BIOCONVERSIONS OF DISCARDS TO RELEASE COMPONENTS ATTACHED TO FOOD MATRICES, WHICH ARE EXTRACTED BY SUITABLE DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. ALGAL BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOREFINERY-BASED APPROACHES HAVE SIGNIFICANT SCOPE FOR COMMERCIAL SCALE PROCESSING OF SEAFOOD DISCARDS. BECAUSE OF THEIR FUNCTIONAL NATURE, THE ISOLATED PRODUCTS CAN HAVE VALUABLE APPLICATIONS IN HEALTH, THERAPEUTIC AND INDUSTRIES IN OTHER FIELDS.

SHELF SCI.,"MANGROVE PROTECTION AND RESTORATION HAVE BEEN PRIORITISED IN INDIA, AND AS A RESULT OF CONCERTED INTERVENTIONS BY KEY MARITIME STATES, MANGROVE COVER HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST FEW DECADES. MANGROVE RESTORATION EFFORTS HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE STATES OF GUJARAT, TAMIL NADU, ODISHA, AND ANDHRA PRADESH FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE MITIGATION OF STORMS AND CYCLONES. THE ‘COMMUNITY-BASED RESTORATION' STRATEGY, IN PARTICULAR, IS CREDITED WITH EXPANSION OF MANGROVE REGIONS ACROSS INDIA. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE MECHANISM OF SUCCESSFUL MANGROVE RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION THROUGH VARIOUS EFFORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THE COASTAL COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF GUJARAT, INDIA. DESPITE RAPID COASTAL DEVELOPMENT, MANGROVE COVER HAS ALSO STEADILY INCREASED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES IN THE STATE, CLEARLY INDICATING A BALANCED APPROACH TOWARDS ENHANCING BLUE ECONOMY. THIS IS CREDITED TO THE VISION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GUJARAT, INDIA FOR PUTTING IN PLACE APPROPRIATE POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION. RESTORATION OF DEGRADED MANGROVE AND AFFORESTATION OF NEW MANGROVES WERE MADE SUCCESSFUL BY APPLYING SCIENTIFIC TRANSPLANTATION OF SAPLINGS, UTILIZATION OF LOCAL RESOURCES, INVOLVEMENT OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS AND EFFICIENT MONITORING ACTIVITIES. THE GOVERNMENT OF GUJARAT HAS DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO INTEGRATE DIVERSE SECTORS TO EFFECTIVELY CONSERVE MANGROVES AND ADOPTING A COMMUNITY-BASED RESTORATION MODEL.

FLOATING PONTOONS) THAT HAVE RESULTED IN NOVEL HABITATS AVAILABLE FOR FLORA AND FAUNA. WHILE THESE ENGINEERED STRUCTURES PROVIDE NEW MARINE HABITAT RESOURCES, FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF BIODIVERSITY, THEY EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT A SUB-SET OF SPECIES FOUND IN NATURAL HABITATS. UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT HAVE USED DIVERS FOR FISH VISUAL CENSUS, WE USED A REMOTELY OPERATED VESSEL WITH AN UNDERWATER CAMERA TO EXAMINE THE FISH COMMUNITY USING FLOATING PONTOONS IN A MARINA FACILITY IN TROPICAL CENTRAL QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA. THE CAMERA FILMED CONTINUOUSLY THE EDGE AND UNDERSIDE OF PONTOONS (BOTH SURVEYS COVERED SIMILAR PONTOON LINEAR DISTANCES – JULY (WINTER) 430M; NOVEMBER (SUMMER) 485M; 2021). FIFTEEN FISH SPECIES REPRESENTING 14 FAMILIES WERE RECORDED, WITH MORE SPECIES OBSERVED DURING SUMMER COMPARED TO THE WINTER SURVEY. REMARKABLY, ACROSS BOTH SURVEYS OF THE 243 FISHES INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE RECORDED, 166 (68%) APPEARED UPSIDE-DOWN IN VIDEOS (I.E., ORIENTED TO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PONTOON). ENGAGING A BEHAVIOUR OF SWIMMING UPSIDE-DOWN HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN NATURAL HABITATS ELSEWHERE; SOME CORAL REEF SPECIES LIVING IN CAVES OR REEF LEDGES ORIENTATE THEMSELVES TO THE CAVE CEILING OR OVERHANGING LEDGE TO INCREASE PREY CAPTURE RATE. HOWEVER, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO RECORD FISHES EXHIBITING THE SAME BEHAVIOUR. WE CONCLUDE THAT OUR LESS INVASIVE VIDEO SURVEY APPROACH PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE FISHES IN A STATE OF NATURAL BEHAVIOUR, ORIENTATING THEMSELVES TOWARDS THE PONTOON SUBSTRATE, WHICH IS PROBABLY SIMPLY A RESPONSE OF ADHERING TO BASIC CHARACTERISTIC MODES, I.E., IT IS THE ORIENTATION RELATIVE TO THE SUBSTRATE THAT IS IMPORTANT, RATHER THAN THEIR ORIENTATION IN SPACE PER SE. INDEED MARINA PONTOONS PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FEATURE IN ALREADY HABITAT COMPLEX ESTUARIES; THESE DATA ADD TO WHY WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OFFERED BY MARINE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE PLASTICITY OF FISH TO ADAPT TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS IN AN EXPANDING BLUE ECONOMY. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD",ECSSD,"N.J.

HOWEVER, THESE DEVELOPMENTS MAY CAUSE EXTERNALITIES, PRIMARILY AFFECTING USERS DEPENDENT ON MARITIME SPACE AND ITS SEASCAPES, SUCH AS TOURISM AND RECREATION (T&R). THE MARINE RENEWABLE EXPANSION, IN GENERAL, IS EXPECTED BY SOME OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED TO AFFECT T&R WITH THE PROSPECT OF DECREASING LOCAL WELFARE AND THE NUMBER OF VISITORS. NONETHELESS, THIS INFLUENCE OVER COASTAL AND MARITIME TOURISM & RECREATION IS NOT WELL ADDRESSED BY ACADEMIC PAPERS. HERE WE ASSESS THIS LITERATURE GAP VIA A SEMI-SYSTEMATIC NARRATIVE META-SYNTHESIS (SSNMS) WHICH EXPANDS ON THE METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS OF TWO GUIDING REFERENCE STUDIES (SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT, 2008; PARSONS & FIRESTONE, 2018) TO CONJECTURE ABOUT THIS TOPIC. THE SSNMS PROMOTES THE EVALUATION STUDIES PRODUCED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2019 SELECTED THROUGH A RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION OF RELEVANT PEER-REVIEWED KEYWORDS IN SCOPUS AND WEB OF SCIENCE. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE STUDIED KNOWLEDGE GAP PERSISTS AND THAT OWFS CAN INDEED IMPACT COASTAL COMMUNITIES DEPENDENT ON MARITIME TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, DESPITE THE OBLIGATORY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR OWFS. HOWEVER, BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS GREATLY VARY WITH DEVELOPMENT STAGES AND LOCATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, RESULTS STILL PROVIDE VALUABLE CONCLUSIONS COMMON TO GENERIC COASTAL AREAS DEALING WITH OFFSHORE WIND FARMS SITTING. IN THE FEW CASES WHERE AUTHORS CONSIDER T&R IN THEIR IMPACT ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS INDICATE A LACK OF PUBLIC SENSITIVITY AND PARTICIPATION. HIGHER CLARITY AND PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS MIGHT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN GENERATING OPTIMISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD OWF PROJECTS AND POSITIVE SYNERGIES IN BETWEEN THE LOCAL BLUE ECONOMY ACTORS. IN CONCLUSION, THE PROJECTED NEGATIVE IMPACTS MAINLY EMERGE AS A REACTION TO THE ABSENCE OF PROPER INTEGRATION BETWEEN LOCAL T&R STAKEHOLDERS AND OWF DEVELOPERS, DEMONSTRATING THAT ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE MITIGABLE AND PREVENTABLE. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A DISTINCTIVE TOURISM & RECREATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE PART OF THE OBLIGATORY TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS SUBMITTED BY THE OWF DEVELOPERS IN COASTAL AREAS THAT RELY ON THESE ACTIVITIES. © 2022",EIARD,"J.T.M.

THE OSCILLATING-WATER-COLUMN (OWC) WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER IS A PROVEN CONCEPT, MANY PROTOTYPES OF WHICH ARE ALREADY BEING DEPLOYED ON THE OPEN SEA, AND CAN HELP BRIDGE THIS GAP. ENERGY HARVESTING FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL BE IMPROVED IF MORE EFFICIENT (AND RELIABLE) POWER TAKE-OFF (PTO) SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ALGORITHMS ARE USED. A NOVEL CONTROL ALGORITHM FOR A TURBINE–GENERATOR SET WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE PTO AND THE OWC SYSTEM. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM REAL OPERATION AT SEA. THE ALGORITHM DOES NOT NEED TO PREDICT THE SEA STATE CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE POWER GENERATION. ADDITIONALLY, IT PROTECTS THE PTO IN EXTREMELY ENERGETIC SEA STATES AND MINIMISES OVERSPEEDING AND THE USE OF A SAFETY VALVE.

THE SECTORAL APPROACH IS KEY TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA WITH POTENTIAL FOR INCOME GENERATION, EMPLOYMENT CREATION AND POVERTY REDUCTION, AS WELL AS CREATING BLUE AND GREEN CARBON SINKS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IN AFRICAN LMES. THE SECTORS ESTABLISH LINKAGES TO COUNTRIES' ESTABLISHED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (NDCS) UNDER THE 2015 PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO PROMOTE INTEGRATED APPROACH AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA. THE APPROACH IS COMPLEMENTED BY THE UTILIZING DESK-TOP LITERATURE REVIEW AND SECONDARY DATA SOURCE ON LMES IN AFRICA FOR BLUE ECONOMY. THIS APPROACH IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH PROFESSIONAL EXPERTS' VIEWS AND OPINIONS, AND ADDITIONAL DATA GATHERED FROM FIELD VISITS TO 13 AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN AUGUST 2019 AND NAIROBI, KENYA AFRICA BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY CONSULTATIVE WORKSHOP IN OCTOBER 2019. THE BLUE ECONOMY APPROACH DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA WILL BENEFIT BOTH INLAND AND COASTAL COUNTRIES. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT A STRONG DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTINENTAL TOURISM WILL BOOST THE DEMAND FOR TOURISM SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECO-TOURISM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSERVATION OF ECOSYSTEMS AND REDUCE THE ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT.

AFTER THE MAPPING OF COASTAL MARINE HABITATS, OUR VALUATION RELIES ON THE TRANSFER OF VALUE OF ALL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FROM REFERENCE MONETARY UNIT VALUES, EXTRACTED FROM THE LITERATURE. A HABITAT FUNCTIONALITY INDEX BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A HIGHER POPULATION DENSITY AND A HIGHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROWTH RATE LEAD TO A DECREASE IN THE FUNCTIONALITY AND SERVICES OF MARINE HABITATS WAS THEN DEFINED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE VALUATION. THE SURVEYED COASTAL HABITATS COVER ABOUT 117,000 KM2, WITH SEAGRASS BEDS BEING BY FAR THE MOST EXTENSIVE HABITAT. PRESENT ALL ALONG THE COASTS OF AFRICA, THEIR SURFACE AREA REPRESENTS ABOUT 62% OF SURVEYED COASTAL HABITATS, FOLLOWED BY THE MANGROVES (23%), CORAL REEFS (15%). KELP FORESTS ARE ONLY PRESENT IN THE SOUTHERN BENGUELA CURRENT LME. WE ESTIMATED THE ANNUAL VALUE OF THE LME'S COASTAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT 814 BILLION USD. CORAL REEFS HAVE THE HIGHEST VALUE (588 BILLION USD/YEAR), FOLLOWED BY SEAGRASS BEDS (135 BILLION USD/YEAR), MANGROVES (91 BILLION USD/YEAR), AND KELP FORESTS (0.4 BILLION USD/YEAR). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FROM THE FOUR COASTAL HABITAT TYPES HAD THE HIGHEST VALUE IN THE AGULHAS CURRENT LME, REPRESENTING 38% OF THE TOTAL VALUE, FOLLOWED BY THE RED SEA LME (28%) AND THE SOMALI COASTAL CURRENT LME (10%).

IT MAY EMERGE WHEN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS IN BALANCE WITH THE LONG TERM CAPACITY OF OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITY IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER. IMPORTANTLY, THE CONCEPT OF BE POSITS THE INHERENT CONFLICTS BETWEEN TWO DISCOURSES—GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND PROTECTION OF OCEAN RESOURCES. THE INHERENT CONFLICTS REQUIRE SOLUTIONS TO EMBRACE THE OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCEAN ECONOMY WHILE RECOGNIZING AND ADDRESSING ITS THREATS. THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS ON A GLOBAL SCALE ARE ADVOCATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN THEIR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS). HOWEVER, WE NOTICE THAT THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES OF THE BE IN LINE WITH THE UN'S SDGS IS VAGUE EVEN CHALLENGING, AND THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR INTERESTS AND ROLES IN THE BE ARE ALSO VAGUE. THIS REVIEW EXAMINES THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE BE AND THE UN'S SDGS, AND RELEVANCE AND ALIGNMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THE LINK BETWEEN THE BE AND SDGS. BASED ON A LITERATURE SURVEY BETWEEN 1998 AND 2018, WE FIND THAT BE IS HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH SDGS 14–17. NOTABLY, WE FIND THAT STAKEHOLDERS PREFER SDG 3 GOOD HEALTH & WELL-BEING AND SDG 8 DECENT WORK & ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE BE CONTEXT. AS STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT SHOWS SOME DIFFERENCES AND VARIATIONS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BE AND SDGS, WE CONSIDER THAT STAKEHOLDERS CAN PLAY SOME ROLES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE BE-SDGS CONTEXT. IN ORDER TO SET ACHIEVABLE GOALS AND TARGETS IN BE-SDGS, WE SUPPORT THAT KEY STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED TO PLAY SEVERAL IMPORTANT ROLES IN PROSPEROUS ECONOMIC, SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT AND SETTING TOLERABLE RANGES FOR THE OCEAN BIOSPHERE. © 2020 THE AUTHORS",ENVID,"J.S.

USING A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW, THIS STUDY FINDS THAT THE FIELD OF THE BLUE ECONOMY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT IS VERY NEW AND EMERGING IN THE LITERATURE, AND THE LINK BETWEEN THE BE AND THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT IS INCREASINGLY BEING INVOKED, YET CLARITY ON THE LINK OR INTERACTIONS REMAIN VAGUE. BY ANALYSING THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF SELECTED KEYWORDS AND NETWORKS, WE PRESENT SIX CLUSTERS (THREE FOR GENERAL RELATIONSHIP, AND THE OTHER THREE FOR SPECIFIC DIMENSIONS OF TOTAL ENVIRONMENT). IN A GENERAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BE AND THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT, CLUSTERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, MARINE RESOURCE, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ARE IDENTIFIED TO LINK DIRECTLY TO THE BE. IN SPECIFIC DIMENSIONS OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT, CLUSTERS OF GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, SPATIAL PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND THE BE ARE PRESENTED. THE ANALYSIS OUTCOMES SHOW THAT SPECIFIC AREAS FROM THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT (GROWTH, SPATIAL PLANNING, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY) ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE BE WHERE A CALL FOR A WIDER RANGE OF STUDIES IN THE FUTURE IS IDENTIFIED. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S)",ENVID,"J.S.

BUILDING ON QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ON EFFORTS TO CREATE MARKETS FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN MARINE CONSERVATION, THIS PAPER ANALYSES HOW AN ENSEMBLE OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS, DEVELOPMENT FINANCE INSTITUTIONS AND PHILANTHROPISTS SEEK TO FILL THE FINANCING GAP FOR MARINE CONSERVATION IN THE “BLUE ECONOMY” BY USING BLENDED FINANCE AS A GUIDING PRINCIPLE. I ARGUE THAT BY OFFSETTING THE UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO INVESTING IN A NEW CONSERVATION FINANCE SPACE, BLENDED FINANCE IS APPLIED AS A WAY TO FIX INVESTORS’ FICTIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND GRADUALLY TRANSFORM UNCERTAINTY IN RISK. IN DOING SO, THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON FOR-PROFIT BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BY HIGHLIGHTING HOW CAPITAL'S RISK INTERPRETATIONS ARE CONSTITUTIVE OF THE EFFORT TO CREATE NEW MARKETS.

CHINA IS ONE OF THE COUNTRIES WITH THE MOST RESOURCES OF BLUE CARBON, WITH CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF 0.835 TG C/A. TO DEVELOP BLUE ECONOMY AND FACILITATE THE FULFILLMENT OF CARBON NEUTRALITY, IT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR CHINA TO BUILD THE BLUE CARBON TRADING MARKET (BCTM). THIS PAPER AIMED TO IMPROVE THE PARTICIPATION PROBABILITY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO CONSTRUCT AN EFFECTIVE BCTM THROUGH EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY. FIRST, WE CONSTRUCTED A TRIPARTITE EVOLUTIONARY GAME MODEL INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENTS, THE SUPPLIERS OF BLUE CARBON (SBC) AND THE DEMANDERS OF BLUE CARBON (DBC), BASED ON THE CORRESPONDING COST AND BENEFIT IN BCTM. TO FURTHER REVEAL THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE COOPERATION OF ABOVE PARTIES, WE ANALYZED THE SENSITIVITY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH FIVE PARAMETERS, I.E., PROPORTION OF SUBSIDIES, UNIT CARBON TAX, BLUE CARBON CREDITS, UNIT PRICE OF BLUE CARBON CREDITS, AND THE COST OF CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION UNIT. TO VERIFY THE GAME MODEL, A CASE STUDY OF BLUE CARBON CREDITS OF MANGROVE TRADING WAS PERFORMED. THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS. IN THE INITIAL STAGE OF BCTM, THE GOVERNMENTS NEED TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN REGULATING AND INCENTIVIZING MOTIVATION OF THE SBC AND DBC. SUBSIDIES AND CARBON TAXES ARE CONDUCIVE TO PROMOTING BCTM TO DEVELOP INTO THE MIDDLE STAGE. IN THE MIDDLE STAGE, PRICE AND QUOTA OF BC CREDITS ARE TWO PRIMARY PARAMETERS TO AFFECT THE EVOLUTIONARY RESULTS OF ABOVE THREE GROUPS. THUS, IT'S NECESSARY FOR THE GOVERNMENTS TO ADJUST THESE PARAMETERS IN TIME. WHEN THE TRADING SCALE AND OPERATION MODE OF BCTM APPROACHING STABLE, THE MARKET WILL ENTER INTO THE MATURE STAGE. THEN, THE GOVERNMENTS CAN REDUCE SUBSIDIES TO SAVE FISCAL EXPENDITURE AND LESSEN THE INTERVENTION, SO AS TO GRADUALLY WITHDRAW FROM THE MARKET. THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS CAN PROVIDE A THEORETICAL BASIS AND REFERENCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF EFFICIENT BCTM AND PROMOTE THE INTEGRATION OF BLUE CARBON INTO THE CARBON MARKET IN CHINA. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD",JCROE,"J.

CLEAN. PROD.,"LARGE-SCALE SEAWEED AQUACULTURE IN THE OCEAN IS BEING PURSUED GLOBALLY AS A SOLUTION TO MANY CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES, INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE, FOOD SECURITY, AND ECOSYSTEM DEGRADATION. HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORMATION OF MARINE SYSTEMS FOR FARMING MAY HAVE UNKNOWN IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS THOSE OUTLINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS). THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO OUTLINE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR, AND THREATS FROM, SEAWEED FARMING IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABILITY. WE SYNTHESISE THE PERSPECTIVES OF EXPERT STAKEHOLDERS FROM MULTIPLE SECTORS THROUGH A SERIES OF AUSTRALIAN WORKSHOPS TO CATALOGUE THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH SEAWEED FARMING MAY AFFECT SUSTAINABILITY, GIVING SPECIFIC FOCUS TO THE SDGS. IN DOING SO, THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATES THAT SEAWEED FARMING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE, TO SOME DEGREE, THE MAJORITY OF SDGS, WITH BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INFLUENCES. INDEED, SEAWEED FARMING IS MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING SDGS 2 (ZERO HUNGER), 8 (DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH), 9 (INDUSTRY, INNOVATION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE), 12 (SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION), AND 15 (LIFE ON LAND). BUT EXPECTATIONS OF SEAWEED FARMING MAY ALSO FALL SHORT FOR SUPPORTING SOME GOALS IF APPROPRIATE MEASURES ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL IMPACTS, MOST NOTABLY SDG 14 (LIFE BELOW WATER). WE UNDERSCORE THAT SEAWEED FARMING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AND THAT THIS POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE REALISED WITH APPROPRIATE REGULATION AND MITIGATION TO AVOID UNWANTED NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. BETTER IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN THESE POTENTIAL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ACROSS SUSTAINABILITY DOMAINS, WILL BE CRITICAL FOR REALISING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF SEAWEED AQUACULTURE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD",JCROE,"S.

THE DATABASE IS COMPOSED OF 28 ANTHROPOGENIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAYERS CATEGORIZED INTO SEVEN BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS. THE DATABASE IS ANALYZED WITH A SET OF GEOSPATIAL MODELS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES AT SEA AND THE POTENTIAL MARINE USE CONFLICTS EMERGING FROM THE AGGREGATION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES. ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES WERE CHARACTERIZED IN TERMS OF MARINE MAMMALS, LOBSTERS, COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT AND THREATENED FISH SPECIES, AND PELAGIC BIRDS AND MAPPED AS BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS USING GEOGRAPHIC CLUSTER ANALYSIS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MOST INTENSELY USED SEA AREAS ARE LOCATED ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF BANGLADESH, AS WELL AS IN THE SWATCH OF NO GROUND (SONG) AREA, WITH MAXIMUM MARINE USE INTENSITY (MUI) SCORES RANGING FROM 5 TO 8. OFFSHORE WATERS OF SAINT MARTIN'S ISLAND HAVE HIGHER MUI SCORES (≥ 5) AS WELL. THE PAIRWISE SPATIAL CONFLICT ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT NATURE PROTECTION SITES PARTICULARLY SONG MARINE PROTECTED AREA (MPA), NIJHUM DWIP MARINE RESERVE (MR), AND SAINT MARTIN'S ISLAND MPA ARE EXPOSED TO THE HIGH MARINE USE CONFLICTS (MUC) INDUCED BY FISHING AND SHIPPING ACTIVITIES. FISHING OPERATIONS GENERATE THE HIGHEST MUC VALUE (MUC = 30) IN SONG MPA, WHEREAS SHIPPING ACTIVITIES PRODUCE THE HIGHEST MUC VALUE (MUC = 24) IN NIJHUM DWIP MR. BOTH OF THE MPAS EXHIBIT 6 TO 12 MUC SCORES INDUCED BY SHIPPING.

HOWEVER, THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS MUST RECOGNIZE THE INTERDEPENDENCE IN THE COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EMPLOYED SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING TO MAP THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF SECCHI DISK DEPTH (SDD) IN HAINAN COASTAL WATERS, CHINA FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND QUANTITATIVELY REVEALED THE IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS ON THE COASTAL WATER ENVIRONMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. BASED ON THE MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER (MODIS) IN SITU CONCURRENT MATCHUPS (N = 123), A SIMPLE GREEN BAND (555 NM)-BASED QUADRATIC ALGORITHM WAS FIRST DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE SDD FOR THE COASTAL WATERS OF HAINAN ISLAND IN CHINA (R2 = 0.70, ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) = 1.74 M). THE LONG TIME-SERIES SDD DATASET (2001–2021) FOR HAINAN COASTAL WATERS WAS RECONSTRUCTED FROM MODIS OBSERVATIONS. SPATIALLY, SDD SHOWED A PATTERN OF HIGH WATER CLARITY IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN COASTAL WATERS AND LOW WATER CLARITY IN THE WESTERN AND NORTHERN COASTAL AREAS. THIS PATTERN IS ATTRIBUTED TO UNBALANCED DISTRIBUTIONS OF BATHYMETRY AND POLLUTION FROM SEAGOING RIVERS. SEASONALLY, THE HUMID TROPICAL MONSOON CLIMATE DROVE THE SDD INTO A GENERAL PATTERN OF HIGH IN THE WET SEASON AND LOW IN THE DRY SEASON. ANNUALLY, THE SDD IN HAINAN COASTAL WATERS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.1), BENEFITING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE INCREASING GLOBAL OCEANIC WIND SPEED IN RECENT YEARS HAS EXACERBATED SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION AND DEEP OCEAN MIXING, COUNTERACTING APPROXIMATELY 14.14% OF THE REMEDIAL MANAGEMENT'S EFFECTIVENESS IN PROTECTING AND RESTORING THE COASTAL ECOSYSTEM.

AT THE SAME TIME, EU MEMBER STATES ARE TAKING THE FIRST STEPS IN DOING MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP). FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING SUCH AS MSP AND PRIORITIZING FUTURE INVESTMENTS, GOVERNMENTS AND POLICY MAKERS ARE IN NEED OF ECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR THE BLUE ECONOMY. ALTHOUGH IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD THE SEA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE DRIVER FOR THE GROWING ECONOMY, RESEARCH ON THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS BEEN LIMITED. HOWEVER, WHEN MSP IS BECOMING THE NORM, EVALUATING THE EXISTING BLUE ECONOMY BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT. IN THIS PAPER, THE ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF BLUE ECONOMIES IS ESTIMATED FOR THE GULF OF BOTHNIA (GOB) REGION OF FINLAND. BY CONDUCTING A CASE STUDY ON THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE BLUE ECONOMY IN A SPECIFIC REGION IT IS POSSIBLE TO BRING THE DISCUSSION OF BLUE GROWTH TO A PRACTICAL AND LOCAL LEVEL. THE GOB WAS SEEN AS A POTENTIAL AREA TO STUDY BLUE GROWTH OR THE BLUE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THE ALREADY EXISTING ACTIVE MARITIME SECTOR AND THE RELATIVELY PRISTINE ENVIRONMENT. THE CORE PROBLEMS OF DEFINING AND QUANTIFYING MULTI-SECTOR RESOURCES SUCH AS THE BLUE ECONOMY WILL BE DISCUSSED, AND COMPREHENSIVE DATA TO SCRUTINIZE THE BLUE ECONOMY SECTOR IN THE GOB WILL BE PROVIDED.

THEREFORE, A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WAS ADAPTED AND APPLIED TO ALLOW AN EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION MAKING THAT PROTECTS AND ENSURES A SUSTAINABLE USE OF SHELLFISH REEFS. THE DUTCH WADDEN SEA WAS SELECTED AS A CASE STUDY THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK. THIS APPLICATION INCLUDED AN ECOLOGICAL MODELLING APPROACH THAT ENABLED THE EXPLORATION OF FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS. FOUR SHELLFISH-BASED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED: DO NOTHING, HOLD THE LINE, ADVANCE THE LINE AND RECOLONIZATION. THESE STRATEGIES WERE APPLIED TO THE MODELLED CLIMATE SCENARIOS AND EVALUATED BY THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS TO THE NET FLOW OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FROM SHELLFISH REEFS.

WITH THE APPLICATION OF THIS FRAMEWORK TO THE CASE STUDIES, AN ESTIMATE WAS MADE OF THE VARIATIONS IN THE VALUE OF PRODUCTION FOR EACH MARINE SECTOR THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MSP. IN GENERAL, THEY WERE POSITIVE IN THE THREE CASES ANALYSED. IN THE MEDIUM SCENARIO, CUMULATIVE FINAL DIRECT IMPACTS OF € 1875 MILLION WERE ESTIMATED IN THE GERMAN CASE (2010–2016 PERIOD), € 929 MILLION IN THE BELGIAN CASE (2014–2016) AND € 2262 MILLION IN THE NORWEGIAN CASE (2013–2016).

PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS ARE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO COUNTERPART MARINE LITTER BUT INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE HINDRANCE THE PROGRESS. THE INTEGRATION OF ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IN THE DECISION-MAKING MAY HELP TO DESIGN KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT GUARANTEE A GOOD MARINE LITTER MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE BLUE ECONOMY FRAMEWORK. NONETHELESS, THERE IS NO CLEAR METHODOLOGY TO DO SUCH ASSESSMENTS IN THE LITERATURE. IN THIS STUDY A NEW APPROACH WAS IMPLEMENTED BY ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE EFFICIENCY OF FOUR SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO REMOVE, MONITOR AND/OR MANAGE FLOATING MARINE LITTER (FML). IN ADDITION, THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY BY LOCAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS FOR PURCHASING SUCH SOLUTIONS WAS ASSESSED. THE SOLUTIONS WERE TESTED IN THE INNER WATERS OF THE BASQUE COAST (SOUTH-EASTERN BAY OF BISCAY), THESE BEING: THE COLLECTION OF FML BY (1) A LITTER INTERCEPTION RIVERINE BARRIER; (2) RETROFITTED FISHING VESSELS ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVE FISHING FOR LITTER; (3) SEA-CLEANING VESSELS OPERATED WITH AND WITHOUT (4) A SMART DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL (LEMA TOOL). THE EFFICIENCY WAS MEASURED BY THE COST OF REMOVING 1 KG OF FML AND COMPARING IT TO OTHER ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES; THE EFFECTIVENESS BY A COMPARISON OF COSTS AND BENEFITS OF REMOVING MARINE LITTER FOR THE LOCAL FISHERIES, AQUACULTURE, PORTS AND SHIPPING AND TOURISM SECTORS; AND THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY WAS EVALUATED BY CONTINGENT VALUATION METHOD. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DENSITY OF FML AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF THE EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND WILLINGNESS TO PAY AND IN RETURN, THE DENSITY DEPENDS ON THE OPERATING GROUND AND THE SEASON OF THE YEAR AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE MOST EFFICIENT SOLUTION IS THE CLEANING VESSELS (4–7 EUR/KG OF FML), FOLLOWED BY THE FISHING FOR LITTER FISHING VESSELS (4–75 EUR/KG). LEMA TOOL MAY IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF BOTH, FISHING VESSELS AND CLEANING VESSEL, BUT THE RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT DEPENDS ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FISHERS, THE ACCURACY OF THE SEA SURFACE CIRCULATION MODELS AND AGAIN THE LOCAL LITTER DENSITY. THE BARRIER PROVED TO BE THE LEAST EFFICIENT SOLUTION (103 EUR/KG) AND ITS EFFICIENCY DEPENDS ON THE RIVER CHARACTERISTICS. CLEANING VESSELS ARE AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, FISHING VESSEL MAY BE EFFECTIVE DEPENDING ON THE OPERATING AREA AMONG OTHER VARIABLES. THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION FOR PURCHASING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE THE REMOVAL OF FML IS ESTIMATED AS 1–8 EUR/KG. THESE OUTPUTS CAN PROVIDE GOOD GUIDANCE FOR DECISION-MAKERS TO OVERCOME THE EXISTING PROBLEM WHILE PREVENTION MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED AND TAKE EFFECT IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

VARIOUS CONTESTED INTERPRETATIONS EXIST, AND DIFFERENT ACTORS CHOOSE TO EMPHASISE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE TRIPLE GOAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER, DESPITE DISAGREEMENT OVER ITS INTERPRETATIONS, THE BLUE ECONOMY FINDS SUPPORT IN MANY DIFFERENT ARENAS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE POSITION OF DOMINANCE THAT THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS REACHED, AND EXAMINES HOW SUPPORTERS OF THE CONCEPT MAINTAIN AND EMPLOY POWER TO KEEP IT RELEVANT. THE PAPER APPLIES A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH: 29 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE IN ROLES OF FORMAL DECISION-MAKING ACROSS THE FISHERIES SECTOR, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TOURISM SECTOR, CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENT SECTOR, AND SPECIFIC BLUE ECONOMY-INSTITUTIONS ARE SUPPLEMENTED BY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE WIDER LANDSCAPE DURING 4 MONTHS OF FIELDWORK IN SEYCHELLES. FINDINGS SHOW THAT IN INTERNATIONAL DISCOURSE, THE BLUE ECONOMY OBTAINS AND MAINTAINS ITS INFLUENCE THROUGH PERSUASION AND THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A ‘COMMON SENSE’ AND PRODUCTIVE WAY FORWARD, CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING TRIPLE WINS. WITHIN THIS NARRATIVE, OCEANS ARE UNDERGOING A RECONFIGURATION AS ECONOMIC FRONTIERS, AND THE BLUE ECONOMY PLACES ECONOMIC GROWTH FROM OCEANS CENTRALLY WITHIN CONTEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. MAINTAINING THE BLUE ECONOMY AS A POWERFUL CONCEPT ON THE GROUND IS DONE THROUGH SOCIAL POWER RELATIONS: THE BLUE ECONOMY FUNCTIONS AS A BOUNDARY OBJECT, CONTRIBUTING TO DEPOLITICISATION OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A SHARED VISION. DEPOLITICISATION ALLOWS SEYCHELLES TO CONTINUE USING THE CONCEPT DESPITE SIMMERING DISSENT AMONG POLICY MAKERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND RESOURCE USERS. DOMINANCE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE MEANS THAT ASSOCIATING WITH IT BRINGS SEYCHELLES VISIBILITY AND INFLUENCE. THE USEFULNESS OF THE CONCEPT IN ELIDING TENSIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR COUNTER-HEGEMONY TO ARISE, ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVES ARE EMERGING ELSEWHERE, SUCH AS BLUE JUSTICE.

COMPLEX FISHERIES GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES, UNSUSTAINABLE RATES OF FISHING AND RISING FISHERIES-RELATED CRIMES HAVE ENSUED.

FIRST, FISHERIES GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS IN AFRICA ACT LARGELY TO CONSTRAIN SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSF) WHILE FAILING TO CONTAIN THE INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES SECTOR, RESULTING IN THE MARGINALISATION OF THE SSF. SECONDLY, DESPITE A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED (IUU) FISHING IN INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES THAN THE SSF, FISHERIES GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE 'SURVIVAL OF THE RICHEST' – THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE 'FITTEST' – THE SSF.

LIKE MANY COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL ASSETS, OCEANS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY A HISTORY OF IMPERFECT GOVERNANCE RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE IMPORTANT SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. ALIGNING AND MANAGING MULTIPLE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN POLICY TARGETS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES IN THE MARINE DOMAIN HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY ATTEMPTED USING MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP). MORE RECENTLY, OCEAN ACCOUNTING (OA) HAS APPEARED AS A FRAMEWORK THAT EXTENDS NATIONAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ECOSYSTEM ACCOUNTING, AND PROVIDES A STRUCTURE TO INTEGRATE THE INFORMATION DESCRIBING OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOCIETY AND THE ECONOMY. GLOBALLY, MSP IS THEREFORE EMPLOYED TO PRIORITISE ACTIONS TOWARDS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WHILE OA IS BEING DEVELOPED TO CENTRALISE, STANDARDISE, AND INTEGRATE OCEAN INFORMATION. AS AWARENESS OF HUMAN DEPENDENCE ON HEALTHY OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS HAS INCREASED, THE USE OF BOTH MSP AND OA HAS GROWN RAPIDLY ACROSS THE WORLD, AND INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO FRAMEWORKS, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND THEORETICALLY ARE EMERGING. TO INFORM BOTH MSP AND OA COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THEIR ROLE IN STRATEGIC OCEAN GOVERNANCE, AND HOW SYNERGIES MAY BE ENHANCED TO FURTHER AN UNDERSTANDING OF COMPLEX OCEAN SYSTEMS. THOUGHTFULLY ALIGNED, THE TWO FRAMEWORKS MIGHT WORK TOGETHER WITH OA PROVIDING DYNAMIC INPUTS TO AN ADAPTIVE MSP PROCESS.

QUESTIONNAIRES 2019 AND 2021 EXAMINED STAKEHOLDERS’ ENGAGEMENT (INTRINSIC MOTIVATION) AND SOCIAL TRUST TOWARDS THE PLANNERS IN THE MSP PROCESS. THE NEED TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES OF COASTAL FISHERY DICTATES COASTAL FISHERY PARTICIPANTS’ PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE FISHERY BUSINESS'S DEVELOPMENT IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT. DESPITE THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH, THE FIRST FINNISH MSP ROUND DID NOT MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE COASTAL FISHERY'S STATUS AS A STAKEHOLDER GROUP. MSP PROCESSES AND DEVELOPING THE SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY ARE PART OF THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK, REQUIRING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND MUTUAL TRUST AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE AND COASTAL AREAS WOULD BENEFIT FROM A JOINT FORUM FOR STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION BUILT UPON MSP. COLLABORATION COULD STRENGTHEN THE INTEGRATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT OF SEA USES AND RESOURCES. © 2022 THE AUTHORS",NA,"A.

POLICY,"GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS ARE COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS WHERE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS INTERACT EXTENSIVELY. THIS IS THE CASE FOR GOVERNANCE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE RESOURCES. HERE, THE RELEVANT POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE ARRANGEMENTS ARE FRAGMENTED, AND MARINE USES, ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES ARE GENERALLY MANAGED ON A SECTORAL BASIS BY INDEPENDENT ENTITIES FROM MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. IN AUSTRALIA, FOR EXAMPLE, COMPLEX ARRANGEMENTS HAVE CREATED UNCERTAINTY IN RELATION TO WHAT, WHEN, HOW, AND BY WHOM BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES ARE POSSIBLE. NETWORK APPROACHES TO MAP AND ANALYSE COMPLEX SYSTEMS COULD POTENTIALLY IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING AND FACILITATE MANAGEMENT OF POLICY AND LEGAL COMPLEXITY. YET, THERE ARE FEW STUDIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED SUCH APPROACHES IN OCEAN GOVERNANCE. OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THE APPLICATION OF AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH BASED ON NETWORK GRAPHS AND TEXT MINING TO ANALYSE A POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH AUSTRALIA'S BLUE ECONOMY (I.E., POLICY AND LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE COASTAL AND MARINE AREAS WITHIN THE SEAWARD BOUNDARIES OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF AROUND THE STATE OF TASMANIA). USING A DATABASE OF OVER 2000 INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE ARRANGEMENTS, CROSS-SECTOR ANALYSES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL GAPS AND OVERLAPS THAT MAY HINDER THE DEPLOYMENT OF BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO INTEGRATED SEAFOOD AND ENERGY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. OUR GRAPHS ALLOWED QUICK AND EASY VISUALISATION OF POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE CLUSTERS AROUND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THOSE ENTITIES AND CLUSTERS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL GAPS AND OVERLAPS IN THE EXISTING POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE LANDSCAPE. RESULTS POINT TO A LACK OF INTEGRATION AND A NEED FOR FIT-FOR-PURPOSE POLICY AND LEGISLATION, PARTICULARLY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CO-LOCATED BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES.

HOWEVER, THE CHOICE OF GEOMETRICAL PARAMETERS FOR BUOY DESIGN IS STILL A CRITICAL PROBLEM. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL METHOD TO DEVELOP NEW GEOMETRIES OF FLOATING BUOY FOR WAVE ENERGY HARVESTER (WEH) IN HEAVE MOTION AND AIMS TO MAXIMIZE WEH ABSORBED POWER AND PERFORMANCE. FIVES SHAPES (CYL-CONE, CYL-HS, CYL-TCC, CYL-AS AND CYL-SP) WERE DERIVED FROM A CYLINDER BUOY BASED ON IDENTICAL PARAMETERS (RADIUS, DRAFT, MASS, WATER-PLANE AREA, VOLUME AND NATURAL FREQUENCY). THE CYL-HS BUOY WAS SELECTED AS A REFERENCE BUOY FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS. THE EFFECTS OF SHAPE CHANGE ON THE PERFORMANCE AND OUTPUT POWER WERE INVESTIGATED FOR REGULAR AND IRREGULAR WAVE CONDITIONS IN ANSYS AQWA AT AN INCIDENT WAVE FREQUENCY OF 0.22 HZ (LOW ENERGY DENSITY SEAS). THE OPTIMAL RESONANT BUOY WAS IDENTIFIED EMPLOYING OPTIMAL AND SUB-OPTIMAL MODES OF THE PTO SYSTEM AT EXTERNAL STIFFNESS AND DAMPING PARAMETERS. MOREOVER, THE PERFORMANCE OF RESONANT BUOYS IN OPTIMAL AND SUBOPTIMAL WORKING MODES WAS VALIDATED STATISTICALLY USING THE F-TEST FOR VARIANCES OF TWO SAMPLES IN ORIGIN PRO (2019). THE ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCIES OF CYL-AS BUOY WERE EXAMINED AS HIGHEST AMONG OTHERS, WITH A MAXIMUM OF 8.4% AND 7.4% RISE IN OPTIMAL AND SUBOPTIMAL PTO MODES FOR REGULAR WAVES, RESPECTIVELY. FOR IRREGULAR WAVES, THE CYL-AS BUOY RESULTED IN MAXIMUM OUTPUT POWER OF 33.9% HIGHER THAN THE CYL-HS BUOY (REFERENCE BUOY) WITH A MAXIMUM CONVERSION EFFICIENCY OF 90%.

MANAGE.,"SCUBA DIVING CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN MARINE TOURISM, BUT ITS SUSTAINABILITY IS CURRENTLY THREATENED DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC RISKS. THE EAST AFRICAN MARINE ECOREGION IS RENOWNED FOR ITS RICHNESS IN MARINE FAUNA AND FLORA, INCLUDING SOME OF THE INDIAN OCEAN'S MOST DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS, MAKING IT A POPULAR DESTINATION FOR SCUBA DIVERS. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EXTERNAL RISKS (INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC) ARE IMPACTING ON DIVE OPERATORS IN THE REGION, CREATING THE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE IMPACTS. THIS RESEARCH WAS THEREFORE AIMED AT IDENTIFYING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE EXTERNAL RISKS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIVE OPERATORS, VIA AN EXPLORATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED REVEALED THAT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON DIVE OPERATORS IN THE EAST AFRICAN MARINE ECOREGION, AND THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF CORAL REEFS, WHILE NOT SEEN AS A THREAT TO DIVE OPERATORS AT PRESENT, CONSTITUTES A KEY THREAT WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE. IN TERMS OF THE VARIATION IN PERCEIVED RISK ACROSS THE REGION, KENYA SUFFERS MOST FROM SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RISKS, TANZANIA FROM ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, MOZAMBIQUE FROM POLITICAL RISKS, AND SOUTH AFRICA FROM ECONOMIC RISKS.

MANAGE.,"TAIWAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES A NATIONAL LEVEL COASTAL BLUE ECONOMY GROWTH (CBEG) PROGRAM TO PROMOTE OCEAN-LINKED INDUSTRIES BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. SEA FARMING DEVELOPMENT IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT NEEDS TO BE PROMOTED FOR THE CBEG PROGRAM. GENERALLY, SEA FARMING RELIES ON ARTIFICIAL TECHNOLOGIES, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TO INCREASE FISHERY RESOURCES AND TO ENHANCE FISHERIES PRODUCTIVITY. DEVELOPING SEA FARMING COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF CAPTURE FISHERIES; IT INTEGRATES THE CONCEPT OF BLUE ECONOMY INTO SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO AS TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN FISHING COMMUNITIES. IN LINE WITH THIS, THE TAIWAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE COMMUNITY-BASED SEA FARMING (CBSF) PROJECT IN 2015. THE CBSF PROJECT AIMS TO ESTABLISH SEA FARMING ZONES TO HELP FISHING COMMUNITIES ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PAPER, THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF SEA FARMING AND SITE SELECTION OF THE CBSF PROJECT WERE DESCRIBED AND THE NEEDS OF LOCAL PEOPLE IN FISHING COMMUNITIES AROUND SEA-FARMING DEMONSTRATION ZONES WERE ALSO ASSESSED. ACCORDING TO FINDINGS, A FRAMEWORK FOR SEA FARMING DEVELOPMENT IS PROPOSED. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, SEVERAL NEW SEA FARMING-BASED INDUSTRIES CAN SERVE AS THE DRIVING FORCE TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FISHING COMMUNITIES. THE DRIVING FORCES INCLUDE DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY-BASED TOURISM RECREATIONAL INDUSTRY, STRENGTHENING LOCALIZED MARKETING OF FEATURED SEAFOOD PRODUCTS, COMBINING LOCAL ECOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES AND CULTURES OF THE FISHING VILLAGE TO DEVELOP RECREATIONAL FISHERY ACTIVITIES, AND INTEGRATING SEAFOOD PRODUCTS WITH RECREATIONAL TOURISM ACTIVITIES. OVERALL, CBSF ARE IMPORTANT TASKS THAT WARRANT CONTINUOUS ATTENTION FOR ENHANCING THE FISHING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE EXPERIENCES AND FRAMEWORK OF PROMOTING THE TAIWAN CBSF PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE BENEFICIAL INFORMATION AND FOUNDATION FOR DECISION MAKERS AND NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGERS IN OTHER AREAS. © 2019 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,"J.-L.

WE DO SO THROUGH CONTENT ANALYSIS OF FORMAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS LEGISLATION AND POLICY DOCUMENTS, AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH GOVERNANCE ACTORS AND ORGANIZATIONS. WE ASSESS POLICY COHERENCE BY EXAMINING WHETHER GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES ARE SHARED WITHIN AND ACROSS EXISTING SECTOR-BASED POLICIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH BLUE ECONOMY OBJECTIVES. WE EXPLORE POLICY COORDINATION THROUGH NETWORK ANALYSIS OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS PEOPLE. A NUMBER OF GAPS IN THE TIMOR LESTE POLICY LANDSCAPE ARE APPARENT, WITH WEAK GOVERNANCE AROUND SOCIAL OBJECTIVES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PORTS SECTOR. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE EXISTING GOVERNING SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH BLUE ECONOMY ASPIRATIONS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE EXISTING, HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL POLICY DOCUMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY PLAYING A CRITICAL BRIDGING ROLE BETWEEN SECTORS. STRENGTHENING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SECTORAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, THROUGH BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING INSTRUMENTS, MAY THEREFORE BE AN EFFICIENT AND PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO BLUE ECONOMY IMPLEMENTATION.

MANAGE.,"A NUMBER OF COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED THAT UP UNTIL NOW MARINE/MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP) RESEARCH AND PRACTICE HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY BLUE ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND HAVE TENDED TO NEGLECT WHAT MIGHT BE REGARDED AS SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS. TO GAIN MORE INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER AND EXTENT OF SUCH A GAP, AS WELL AS HOW TO ADDRESS IT, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES ON MSP BETWEEN 2005 AND 2020. USING SEARCH TERMS SUCH AS PARTICIPATION, DEMOCRACY, SOCIAL INCLUSION, SOCIAL COHESION, EQUITY WE SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY AND REVIEW 310 SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES THAT ADDRESS DIVERSE SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS WITHIN MSP AND MARINE GOVERNANCE. THE REVIEW SHOWED THAT VERY FEW PAPERS SYSTEMATICALLY CONCEPTUALISED OR DEVELOPED A COHERENT FRAMEWORK FOR ENGAGING WITH SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. INSTEAD, THEY MOSTLY ADDRESSED PARTICULAR SOCIAL CONCERNS INCLUDING PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT, EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, SOCIO-CULTURAL VALUES AND PREFERENCES. MARINE MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS RELATED INSTRUMENTAL FRAMINGS OF THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATION WERE THE KEY ARGUMENTS FOR INCLUDING THESE DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IN MSP. IN TERMS OF HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IN MSP, MOST ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO SOCIAL-CULTURAL MAPPING AND WAYS TO IMPROVE SOCIAL INCLUSION/PARTICIPATION WHILE ALSO REDRESSING EXCLUSION AND MALDISTRIBUTION OF OUTCOMES IN MSP PRACTICE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO DEEPEN AND DIVERSIFY MSP INQUIRY WITH RESPECT TO SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. IN PARTICULAR, SCHOLARS WOULD DO WELL TO DELVE DEEPER AND MORE BROADLY IN SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE TO FIND INSPIRATION ON WAYS TO UNDERSTAND AND ELUCIDATE SOCIAL ISSUES. HERE, THE ENORMOUS BODY OF RELEVANT WORK ON JUSTICE, POWER, CRITICAL INSTITUTIONALISM, POLITICAL ECOLOGY AND TERRESTRIAL PLANNING LITERATURES HAS HARDLY BEEN TAPPED. IT IS ALSO EVIDENT FROM THIS REVIEW THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR BOTH THE ACADEMIC AND PRACTICE-BASED COMMUNITIES TO MORE COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS HOW THE MULTIDIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS WITH ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF MARINE PLANNING AND GOVERNANCE. BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS, WE HIGHLIGHT A SET OF SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO DEVELOP MSP RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ON SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY.

HOWEVER, OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE NO EFFECTIVE PLANS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECTOR. IN THIS PAPER, WE HAVE COMPILED INFORMATION ON THE HISTORICAL DISCREPANCIES IN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN THE EXTENSIVE BRAZILIAN WATERS AND USED IT TO ILLUSTRATE THE INSTITUTIONAL NEGLECT OF THIS IMPORTANT BLUE-ECONOMY SECTOR. SINCE THE 1930S, WHEN THE FIRST MANAGEMENT AGENCIES WERE REGISTERED, FISHERIES MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN HANDLED BY AT LEAST 10 DIFFERENT FEDERAL AGENCIES. THIS DISCONTINUITY HAS RESULTED IN A COUNTRY THAT IS IGNORANT, OVERALL, OF THE QUANTITY FISHED, WHERE FISHING OCCURS, AND THE STATUS OF ITS FISH STOCKS. THE ONLY AVAILABLE LONG-TERM FISHING PRODUCTION DATA IS HELD BY SMALL STATE DEPARTMENTS OR MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO REFLECTING THE TOTAL CATCH OF THE COUNTRY, WITH ITS CONTINENTAL DIMENSIONS AND ITS MIX OF ARTISANAL AND INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES. FOR THIS REASON, THE PRESENT WORK HAS COMPILED INFORMATION ON THE YEARS OF NEGLECT IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE FISHING SECTOR.

HEREIN, WE COMBINE THE METHODS OF NETWORK SCIENCE (I.E., THE PRODUCT SPACE) AND ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY (I.E., THE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY AND COUNTRY COMPLEXITY) TO DRAW THE WORLD BLUE PRODUCT SPACE FOR 2017 AND THE EVOLUTION MAPS OF BLUE PRODUCT SPACE BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. FROM 1995 TO 2015 AND RANK THE 66 BLUE PRODUCTS AND 235 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, RESPECTIVELY. WE FIND THAT (I) HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES ARE THE MAIN EXPORTERS OF MORE COMPLEX BLUE PRODUCTS, WHILE LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES ARE THE MAIN EXPORTERS OF LESS SOPHISTICATED BLUE PRODUCTS. WE ALSO FIND THAT (II) THE EXPORT SHARES OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED BLUE PRODUCTS INCREASE WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, WHILE THE EXPORT SHARES OF THE LESS SOPHISTICATED BLUE PRODUCTS DECREASE WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT (III) THE DIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT LEVEL OF THE BLUE ECONOMY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO INCOME; THAT IS, COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER INCOME HAVE A GREATER LEVEL OF BLUE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY, AND VICE VERSA. THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT NETWORK SCIENCE AND ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT LEVEL OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, AND THEY CAN BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL POLICY ANALYSIS COMBINATION FOR MEASURING THE EXTENT OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,NA,NA,NA,09645691,OCEAN AND COASTAL MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,7,NA,NA,NA,FINAL,ELSEVIER LTD,SCOPUS,BUILDING A BRIDGE BETWEEN ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY AND THE BLUE ECONOMY,ARTICLE,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120431735&doi=10.1016%2fj.ocecoaman.2021.105987&partnerID=40&md5=99e211515589259e14eb9c2eb15d9296,216,2022,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,none,QILU UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (SHANDONG ACADEMY OF SCIENCES),QILU UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (SHANDONG ACADEMY OF SCIENCES),NA,"QI X, 2022, OCEAN COAST MANAGE","QI X, 2022, OCEAN COAST MANAGE"

MANAGE.,"THE VULNERABILITY OF COASTAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS PROVIDES STRONG ARGUMENTS FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT (EAFM) WHICH INCORPORATES BOTH HUMAN AND ECOSYSTEM WELL-BEING WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE PRESENT STATUS, FUTURE POTENTIALS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FRAMEWORK OF THE EAFM FOR THE SUSTAINABLE COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT OF BANGLADESH. USING BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES OF INFORMATION, THIS STUDY HAS FOUND THAT SOME LEVELS OF EAFM ARE ALREADY IN PRACTICE TO SOME EXTENT IN SOME SPECIFIC COASTAL RIVER ECOSYSTEMS ALONG THE HILSA (TENUALOSA ILISHA) SANCTUARIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF JUVENILE AND BROOD HILSA, BUT OFTEN NOT IMPLEMENTED AND MANAGED IN AN APPROPRIATE PLANNED AND OBJECTIVE WAY. THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF ECOSYSTEM WELL-BEING FOR A FEW FISHERIES BUT SOME LEVELS OF DETERIORATION OF THE ECOSYSTEM HAVE BEEN NOTICED AS WELL. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS ECOSYSTEM WELL-BEING IN ONE HAND AND ITS CONTINUED INTERRUPTION AND DETERIORATION IN ANOTHER HAND INTERACT AND AFFECT HUMAN WELL-BEING FOR MAKING A RESILIENT SOCIETY IN THE FISHING COMMUNITIES. THE EAFM HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE BOTH THE ECOSYSTEM AND HUMAN WELL-BEING IN THE COMING YEARS AS WELL AS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BLUE ECONOMY AND ACHIEVE SOME SDG TARGETS.

MANAGE.,"TRANSITIONING TO A BLUE ECONOMY THAT PRIORITIZES SOCIAL EQUITY WILL BE CHALLENGING IN OCEAN SECTORS BUT COULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASIER FOR NEWER INDUSTRIES WHERE APPROPRIATE GUIDELINES CAN BE FOLLOWED FROM THE START. WE FOCUS HERE ON TWO EMERGING OCEAN SECTORS—BLUE CARBON AND OCEAN ENERGY—AND AN EVALUATION OF BENEFIT-SHARING AGREEMENTS AT OPERATIONAL SITES, AND THE RECIPIENTS AND TYPES OF THESE BENEFITS. THIS IS AN INITIAL YET USEFUL GAUGE OF PROGRESS TOWARDS INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL EQUITY CONCERNS AS ENVISIONED UNDER A BLUE ECONOMY. THE NUMBER (N = 84) AND SCALE OF OCEAN ENERGY SITES IS RAPIDLY INCREASING BUT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IN A FEW REGIONS. THE OCEAN ENERGY SECTOR IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON SERVING GRIDS IN URBANIZED AREAS AND REDUCING NATIONAL EMISSIONS, AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT-SHARING MECHANISMS WITH LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE LESS COMMON (35% OF ALL SITES). HOWEVER, SOME CASES SHOW HOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN BE BETTER INCLUDED IN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OCEAN ENERGY, INCLUDING NEGOTIATION OF SUBSEQUENT ECONOMIC BENEFITS. DESPITE WIDESPREAD INTEREST IN BLUE CARBON, WE FOUND VERY FEW (N = 4) OPERATIONAL SITES; NONETHELESS, THESE WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH AND OFTEN LED BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES. VOLUNTARY PUBLIC AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACTIONS ARE USEFUL, BUT GOVERNMENT REGULATION MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN REQUIRING EQUITABLE PROCESSES AND SUPPORTING EQUITABLE OUTCOMES, SIMILAR TO NOW-STANDARD ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS TO AVOID NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY. EMERGING OCEAN SECTORS HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE SOCIAL EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN BLUE ECONOMIES, BUT THIS WILL BE MUCH MORE EASILY ACHIEVED IF EQUITY GUIDELINES ARE PRIORITIZED AND MANDATED SO THAT BUSINESS-AS-USUAL PRACTICES DO NOT BECOME ENTRENCHED. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,"A.M.

MANAGE.,"MARINE ECOTOURISM IS A PIVOTAL SECTOR IN THE BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGIES OF MANY NATIONS AND IS A VITAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FOR PERIPHERAL COASTAL REGIONS AND ISLANDS; YET A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS SOCIOECONOMIC IMPORTANCE REMAINS POORLY QUANTIFIED DUE TO A LACK OF SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE COLLATION. THIS IS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER TRADITIONAL MARINE ACTIVITIES (I.E. COMMERCIAL FISHERIES), WHICH ARE THE TARGET OF MONITORING PROGRAMS THAT SPAN SEVERAL DECADES. THE PAUCITY OF INFORMATION ON MARINE ECOTOURISM AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE OF TRADITIONAL ACTIVITIES IN DECISION-MAKING ARENAS REPRESENT A PRACTICAL IMPEDIMENT TO PROMOTING THE BROADER AGENDA OF BLUE GROWTH AND ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT FOR EUROPE'S REGIONAL SEAS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT OF NON-EXTRACTIVE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH MARINE BIODIVERSITY (I.E. WHALE WATCHING, DIVING AND BIG GAME FISHING) IN ONE OF EUROPE'S OUTERMOST REGIONS: THE AZORES ARCHIPELAGO (NORTHEAST ATLANTIC). DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS OF THE CLIENTS (N = 1740) AND MANAGERS OF MARINE-TOURISM BUSINESSES (N = 49). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IN 2014 APPROXIMATELY 17% OF TOTAL VISITORS TO THE AZORES ENGAGED IN MARINE ECOTOURISM ACTIVITIES GENERATING APPROXIMATELY 80€ MILLION IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY (2.2% OF REGIONAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT). RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT ON AVERAGE A TYPICAL MARINE ECOTOURIST HAS LONGER STAY AND HIGHER EXPENDITURE PATTERN COMPARED TO OTHER VISITORS.

THESE SO-CALLED OCEAN-BASED CLIMATE “SOLUTIONS” OFTEN FALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE “BLUE ECONOMY,” A TERM USED TO REFER TO NEW WAYS OF ORGANIZING OCEAN ECONOMIES TO PROVIDE EQUITABLE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. YET, THUS FAR THE LITERATURE EXPLORING BLUE ECONOMIES AND BLUE ECONOMY GOVERNANCE HAS LARGELY OVERLOOKED OR DOWNPLAYED ITS EQUITY AND JUSTICE ROOTS AND IMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING HOW BLUE ECONOMIES ARE EMBEDDED IN MULTIPLE SCALES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN BLUE ECONOMIES INCLUDE OFFSHORE OIL PRODUCTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO BOTH EMPHASIZE THE NEED AND PROVIDE AN APPROACH TO INCORPORATE JUSTICE AND EQUITY—SPECIFICALLY CLIMATE JUSTICE—INTO BLUE ECONOMY PLANNING AND SCHOLARSHIP. WE BUILD ON CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF BLUE ECONOMIES AS ASSEMBLAGES TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE GLOBAL REACH OF CLIMATE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH OIL THAT ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED OR IGNORED AT SITES OF PRODUCTION AND THROUGH REGIONAL GOVERNANCE. WE ARGUE THAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE LIFE CYCLE OF OIL SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN POLICIES AND PLANNING (INCLUDING BLUE ECONOMY PLANNING) AT SITES OF PRODUCTION, BUT THAT THIS MUST ALSO INCORPORATE UNDERLYING POWER STRUCTURES THAT LEAD TO UNEVEN IMPACTS AND CLIMATE INJUSTICE. WE LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AS A REGIONAL GOVERNANCE TOOL THAT COULD BE USED TO SHAPE OPPORTUNITIES AND OPENINGS TO ORGANIZE BLUE ECONOMIES DIFFERENTLY. TO ILLUSTRATE THESE POINTS, WE LOOK AT HOW ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE PLAYING (AND COULD PLAY) A ROLE IN ENACTING AND SHAPING NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR'S BLUE ECONOMY. © 2022 THE AUTHORS",NA,"L.M.

THIS GOAL IS PURSUED BY THE AUSTRALIAN AQUACULTURE, OFFSHORE ENGINEERING AND RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRIES, RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE “BLUE ECONOMY COOPERATIVE RESEARCH CENTRE”. TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF OFFSHORE FOOD AND ENERGY PRODUCTION, LEVERAGING THE BENEFITS OF CO-LOCATION, VERTICAL INTEGRATION, INFRASTRUCTURE AND SHARED SERVICES, WILL BE ENABLED THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL MULTI-PURPOSE OFFSHORE-PLATFORMS (MPOP). THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE DESIGNED SYSTEMS WHEN BEING DEPLOYED IN THE HARSH OFFSHORE ENVIRONMENT IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING THE MPOPS. EMPLOYING STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY ANALYSIS METHODS FOR ASSESSING THE STRUCTURAL SAFETY OF THE NOVEL AQUACULTURE-MPOPS COMES WITH DIFFERENT LIMITATIONS. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT SHEDDING LIGHT ON THESE LIMITATIONS AND DISCUSSES THE CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF A NOVEL AQUACULTURE-MPOP CONSIDERING AUSTRALIA'S UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT. TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, CHALLENGES WHICH EXIST AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT, FROM DATA COLLECTION AND UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION TO LOAD AND STRUCTURAL MODELLING AND RELIABILITY ANALYSIS IMPLEMENTATION, ARE DISCUSSED. FURTHERMORE, SEVERAL SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES ARE PROPOSED BASED ON THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE IN OTHER SECTORS, AND PARTICULARLY FROM THE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY.

RECENTLY DEVELOPED WAVE ENERGY CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HELP OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS BY PROVIDING CO-LOCATED AND PERSISTENT POWER GENERATION FOR OCEAN OBSERVATIONS, ENABLING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR OCEAN RESEARCH. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP THE FIRST TECHNO-ECONOMIC MODEL FOR WAVE-POWERED OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEMS AND USE THE MODEL TO STUDY SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS AND COST DRIVERS. OUR MODEL UTILIZES TIME-DOMAIN SIMULATION AND OPTIMIZATION TO IDENTIFY COST-OPTIMAL SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS AND TO ESTIMATE CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL COSTS. USING OUR MODEL, WE EVALUATE THE USE OF WAVE ENERGY TO POWER A 200 W OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM DEPLOYED FOR FIVE YEARS AT FIVE UNIQUE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. WE FOUND THAT, DEPENDING ON THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, COST-OPTIMAL WAVE ENERGY POWERED SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ≈ 0.5–3 KW WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER AND AN ≈ 15-50 KWH BATTERY. THE CORRESPONDING RANGE OF POWER SYSTEM COSTS OVER THE DEPLOYMENT DURATION IS BETWEEN $110,800 AND $673,200. WE BUILD ON THESE RESULTS BY PERFORMING A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF KEY MODEL PARAMETERS AND IDENTIFYING THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF FUTURE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS.

ENERGY,"DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO UTILIZE NATURAL RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND FLUXES IS CRITICAL TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY CRISIS. AS A RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCE, WAVE ENERGY IS MORE PREDICTABLE AND HAS A HIGHER POWER DENSITY COMPARED TO SOLAR AND WIND. HOWEVER, THE TECHNOLOGY FOR WAVE ENERGY HARVESTING IS STILL RELATIVELY NASCENT. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES AS THE SECTOR DEVELOPERS IS THE LACK OF SPATIAL–TEMPORAL REPRESENTATION OF WAVE RESOURCES, OR WAVE POWER GENERATION, FROM A GENERIC WEC. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL WAVE NET POWER ASSESSMENT (WNPA) METHOD BY UTILIZING THE THEORETICAL WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER (WEC) POWER LIMITS (INCLUDING THE RADIATION POWER LIMITS, BUDAL'S LIMIT, AND GROSS WAVE POWER), AND APPLIES IT TO A DECADE OF WAVE CONDITIONS ACROSS THE USA EAST COAST, WEST COAST AND HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. THE WNPA METHOD ASSESSES THE WAVE RESOURCE FROM DEVICE POINT OF VIEW (UNLIKE TRADITIONAL GROSS WAVE RESOURCE ASSESSMENT) AND IS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO WECS REGARDLESS OF DIMENSION, SIZE, AND DEGREES OF FREEDOM (DOFS). THE GEOSPATIAL APPLICATION OF THE WNPA METHOD ALLOWED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF WAVE POWER PRODUCTION POTENTIAL ALONG U.S. COASTLINES AND PROVIDES WEC DEVELOPERS MEANINGFUL DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE BEST SPATIAL REGION TO DEPLOY CERTAIN WECS. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ARE CONDUCTED FOR WECS WITH 5 DIFFERENT SIZES, 3 DIFFERENT OPERATING MODES ACROSS THE WEST COAST, EAST COAST, AND HAWAII OVER 10 YEARS. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTIVITY, EFFICIENCY AND GROSS POWER QUALITY COMPARISONS ARE MADE IN TERMS OF THE SIZE AND DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM FOR WECS DEPLOYED AT CERTAIN OCEAN SITES (E.G., PACWAVE). A FEW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS: (1) THE NET WAVE POWER IS DRAMATICALLY SMALLER THAN THE GROSS WAVE POWER, WHICH INDICATES THE NEW WNPA METHOD HAS A MORE CONSERVATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE WAVE POWER POTENTIAL; (2) A HEAVING 10 M WEC IS FOUND TO HAVE THE HIGHEST (COMPARED TO OTHER SIZES AND DEGREES OF FREEDOM) ABSORPTION EFFICIENCY ON THE WEST COAST AND HAWAII; (3) FOR SMALLER 2 M SURGING/PITCHING WECS, OCEAN SITES ON THE EAST COAST (E.G., DIAMOND SHOALS, NC) MAXIMIZE POWER PRODUCTION. (4) THERE ARE DISTINCT TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN MAXIMIZING POWER OR MINIMIZING POWER QUALITY AND DEPENDENCIES EXISTS BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF INTEREST, THE WEC SIZE, AND THE PRIORITY DEGREE OF FREEDOM. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY CAN BE UTILIZED BY WEC TECHNOLOGY AND PROJECT DEVELOPERS TO CONDUCT APRIORI PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF WEC DEPLOYMENT LOCATIONS AND DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS. © 2023 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"B.

THE WAY IN WHICH THE BLUE ECONOMY IS CONCEIVED AND UNDERSTOOD DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS DIFFERENT SETS OF ACTORS. A PARTICULAR AREA OF CONTESTATION EXISTS AROUND WHICH OCEAN BASED INDUSTRIES OR SECTORS CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE ‘BLUE’. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY BECOMING A FORUM THROUGH WHICH THE LEGITIMACY OF DIFFERENT PRIVATE USES OF OCEAN RESOURCES IS CONTESTED AND DEBATED. THE QUESTION OF LEGITIMACY OF BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES AND SECTORS IS EXPLORED THROUGH A CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NOTION OF A ‘SOCIAL LICENSE TO OPERATE’ (SLO). WHILST SLO IS NORMALLY CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES OR DEVELOPMENTS, IN THIS ARTICLE WE EXPLORE THE APPLICABILITY OF SLO AT A CROSS-SECTORAL SCALE. IN DOING SO WE EXAMINE HOW THE CONCEPT OF SLO MAY INFORM DEBATES OVER APPROPRIATE PRIVATE USE OF PUBLIC OCEAN RESOURCES, AND HOW THIS MIGHT INFLUENCE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE BROADER CONCEPT OF A BLUE ECONOMY. A CASE STUDY INVOLVING A RANGE OF PRIVATE SECTORS ACTORS ENGAGED IN DIVERSE OCEAN INDUSTRIES WAS CONDUCTED, DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS, A CROSS-SECTORAL SURVEY AND AN INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP WITH THE OCEAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THE CASE STUDY EXPLORES THE ROLE THAT SLO IS CURRENTLY PLAYING IN OCEAN INDUSTRIES. IN PARTICULAR WE EXPLORE PERCEPTIONS OF WHO GRANTS A SLO, WHAT KIND OF CONCERNS IMPACT A SLO AND HOW SECTORS WORK TO OBTAIN, OR MAINTAIN, A SLO. BY COMPARING THE RESPONSES OF INDIVIDUAL SECTORS TO THESE THREE CRITICAL QUESTIONS, WE IDENTIFY THAT MANY OF THE SLO CHALLENGES CURRENTLY BEING EXPERIENCED BY OCEAN INDUSTRIES RELATE TO CONFLICTING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VALUES. THIS IS CREATING A RANGE OF COMPLEX, SOMETIMES IRRESOLVABLE, SLO CHALLENGES FOR MARITIME INDUSTRIES, LARGELY CONCENTRATED IN SECTORS ENGAGED IN RESOURCE EXTRACTION, SUCH AS MINING AND OIL AND GAS. IN ADDITION WE FIND THAT ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS SLO CHALLENGES TO DATE FOCUS MOSTLY ON TECHNICAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS. WHEN COMPARING THIS TO BLUE ECONOMY NARRATIVES WE FIND THAT CURRENT ENGAGEMENT WITH SLO SPEAKS PRIMARILY TO INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY WHICH FAVOUR GROWTH BASED NARRATIVES, AND LARGELY NEGLECT COMPETING DISCOURSES. THIS HAS CONSIDERABLE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OVERALL LEGITIMACY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, AS THE LOSS OF SLO WITHIN ONE SECTOR MAY UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT OVERALL. THIS RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF BROADER SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT IN QUESTIONS ABOUT APPROPRIATE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITIES IN THE OCEAN. © 2019 THE AUTHORS",NA,"J.

CLEARLY THERE ARE MANY COMBINATIONS AND MANY VALUE PROPOSITIONS. HOWEVER, MOST TECHNOLOGIES TO DATE ARE CONSIDERED BLUE SKY CONCEPTS, WITH LITTLE ROBUST TECHNO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATING PROFITABILITY. THE PAPER BEGINS BY PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF BLUE GROWTH AND MULTI-USE IN BLUE GROWTH; BOTH IN POLICY AS WELL AS THE WIDE RANGE OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING OCEAN ENERGY, OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY, OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE AND DESALINATION. THE MARIBE H2020 PROJECT PROVIDES THE VEHICLE FOR THE RESEARCH ELEMENT OF THE PAPER. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION IS A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR SELECTING, FILTERING, DEVELOPING AND RANKING BUSINESS PROPOSITIONS FOR MULTIPLE-USE OF SPACE (MUS) AND MULTI-USE PLATFORMS (MUP). APPLICATION OF THE METHOD FOR THE FIRST TIME IDENTIFIED THREE CASE STUDIES WHERE BLUE GROWTH COMBINATION PROJECTS CAN BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, WITH ATTRACTIVE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRRS). RESULTS PRESENTED FOR THE CASE STUDIES REPORT STANDARD INVESTMENT METRICS AND SHOW THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH PRODUCT (ENERGY, FOOD, WATER) TO THE SYSTEM PROFITABILITY, AS WELL AS SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT. EXISTING COMPANIES WERE FULLY ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS. CO-CREATION BETWEEN SECTOR EXPERTS AND INDUSTRY LED TO BOTH IMPROVED BUSINESS VALUE PROPOSITIONS AND ROBUST ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENT READINESS. IN CONTRAST TO THE PRESUMPTION THAT LARGE SCALE PLATFORMS ARE COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE, THE HIGHEST RANKING CASE STUDY COMPANIES REQUIRED SMALLER CAPITAL EXPENDITURE (CAPEX) AND OPERATED IN NICHE SUBSECTORS. IN CONCLUSION, THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE CASE STUDIES SHOULD PROVIDE CONFIDENCE FOR THE EC AS WELL AS INVESTORS THAT MUS AND MUP HAVE VIABLE ECONOMIC FUTURES LEADING TOWARDS COMMERCIALISATION.

THE TWOFOLD OBJECTIVE OF BOTH BOOSTING THE BLUE ECONOMY AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IS CHALLENGING IN PRACTICE AND MARINE PLANNERS NEED DECISION SUPPORT. CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (CIA) WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE HUMAN IMPRINT ON THE WORLD'S OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS.

THIS HAS ALLOWED US TO PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FOR DIFFERENT PLANNING ALTERNATIVES THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING PROCESS, STRENGTHENING THE INTEGRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS INTO STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING. EVERY MSP DECISION MAY ENTAIL A LOCAL SHIFT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, CAUSING POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS. THE RESULTS FROM SWEDISH MSP IN THE NORTH SEA AND BALTIC SEA ILLUSTRATE THAT MSP CERTAINLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LOWER NET CUMULATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, BOTH LOCALLY AND ACROSS SEA BASINS, AS LONG AS ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES ARE RATED HIGH AND PREVAILING PRESSURES DERIVE FROM ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF MSP.

TOTAL ENVIRON.,"SLUDGE INCINERATION AND SEAWATER DESALINATION ARE TWO APPROACHES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE ACTIVATED SLUDGE (WAS) AND FOR OBTAINING FRESH WATER. AS RESOURCE RECOVERY FROM WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND WATER PURIFICATION IS A TOPIC OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THESE TIMES, “WATER MINING” HAS BECOME A FOCUS OF RESEARCH, WITH PHOSPHATE/P-RECOVERY FROM WAS INCINERATION ASH, AND EXTRACTION OF USEFUL ELEMENTS FROM THE BRINE OF DESALINATION BEING IMPORTANT STEPS IN THE PURSUIT OF A CIRCULAR/BLUE ECONOMY. HOWEVER, P-RECOVERY FROM ASH INVOLVES REMOVING METALS, WHICH NEED TO BE DISPOSED OF CAREFULLY, AS DOES THE BRINE COLLECTED. IF CATIONS IN THE ASH AND ANIONS IN THE BRINE COULD BE COMBINED IN ORDER TO PRODUCE COAGULANTS/FLOCCULANTS, A NEW CIRCULAR MODEL WOULD BE ESTABLISHED. A PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT A LIQUID POLY‑ALUMINUM CHLORIDE (PAC) COULD BE SYNTHESIZED FROM THE ALUMINUM ION/AL3+ REMOVED FROM THE ASH AND THE ORIGINAL BRINE. WITH THIS WORK, WE SYNTHESIZED THE LIQUID PAC BY A HYDROTHERMAL METHOD, AND THE RESULTS FROM INFRARED SPECTROMETER DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SYNTHESIZED PAC WAS SIMILAR TO A COMMERCIAL PAC. MOREOVER, THE SYNTHESIZED PAC WAS ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY REDUCE THE EFFLUENT TURBIDITY OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS (WWTPS), ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH THE COMMERCIAL PAC. IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT RESEARCH IN THIS AREA BE CONTINUED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SYNTHESIZED COAGULANTS AND TO PRODUCE DIFFERENT COAGULANTS BASED ON CATIONS AND ANIONS IN ASH AND BRINE. © 2022 ELSEVIER B.V.",STEVA,"X.

THE RESTRICTIONS TAKEN TO SLOW DOWN THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IMPACT SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THESE COVID-19 IMPACTS ON THE OCEAN-HUMAN SYSTEM IS LACKING. THE CURRENT STUDY FILLS THIS GAP BY SYNTHESIZING THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE GLOBAL OCEAN BY CONDUCTING A SYSTEMIC SCOPING REVIEW OF 92 PUBLISHED ARTICLES. FROM A GEOSPATIAL PERSPECTIVE, THE STUDIES COVERED A TOTAL OF 37 COUNTRIES, MAINLY FROM ASIA, EUROPE, AND NORTH AMERICA, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA. FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON GLOBAL OCEANS WERE SUMMARIZED. NOTABLY, IMPROVED COASTAL WATER QUALITY AND REDUCED UNDERWATER NOISE WERE REPORTED. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE INCREASING COVID-19-RELATED MEDICAL WASTE SUCH AS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT LEADS TO SEVERE POLLUTION, WHICH THREATENS THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM AND WILDLIFE. FROM A SOCIOECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC WERE NEGATIVE THROUGHOUT WITH MARINE TOURISM AND THE FISHERY INDUSTRY BEING SEVERELY DISRUPTED. COASTAL COMMUNITIES SUFFERED FROM LOSS OF INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, INEQUALITIES AND HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSFORMATION OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIC PRACTICES IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR OCEAN AND BOOST PROGRESS TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 14 (SDG 14). FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INCLUDE OTHER SECTORS SUCH AS MARINE BIODIVERSITY, MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND BLUE ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES.

TOTAL ENVIRON.,"THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF BLUE ECONOMY AND HUMAN USE OF OFFSHORE SPACE TRIGGERED THE CONCEPT OF CO-LOCATION OF MARINE ACTIVITIES AND IS CAUSING DIVERSE LOCAL PRESSURES ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE PRESSURES ADD TO, AND INTERACT WITH, GLOBAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND WARMING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE COMBINED PRESSURES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE PLANNED CO-LOCATION OF OFFSHORE WIND FARM (OWF) AND AQUACULTURE ZONES ON THE CARBON FLOW THROUGH EPIFAUNAL COMMUNITIES INHABITING WIND TURBINES IN THE NORTH SEA. A 13C-LABELLED PHYTOPLANKTON PULSE-CHASE EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED IN MESOCOSMS (4 M3) HOLDING UNDISTURBED HARD-SUBSTRATE (HS) COMMUNITIES, NATURAL SEDIMENT WITH INFAUNA, AND MOBILE INVERTEBRATE PREDATORS. CARBON ASSIMILATION WAS QUANTIFIED UNDER CURRENT AND PREDICTED FUTURE-CLIMATE CONDITIONS (+3 °C AND −0.3 PH UNITS), AS WELL AS A FUTURE-CLIMATE CO-USE SCENARIO WITH BLUE MUSSEL (MYTILUS EDULIS) AQUACULTURE. CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED AN INCREASE IN MACROFAUNAL CARBON ASSIMILATION AS WELL AS AN ORGANIC ENRICHMENT OF UNDERLYING SEDIMENTS. DYNAMIC (NON-)TROPHIC LINKS BETWEEN M. EDULIS AND OTHER HS EPIFAUNA RESULTED IN SHIFTS AMONG THE SPECIES CONTRIBUTING MOST TO THE PHYTOPLANKTON-DERIVED CARBON FLOW ACROSS CLIMATE SCENARIOS. INCREASED INTER- AND INTRASPECIFIC RESOURCE COMPETITION IN THE PRESENCE OF M. EDULIS AQUACULTURE PREVENTED A LARGE INCREASE IN THE TOTAL ASSIMILATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON BY HS FAUNA. LOWER INDIVIDUAL CARBON ASSIMILATION RATES BY BOTH MUSSELS AND OTHER EPIFAUNA SUGGEST THAT IF FILTER CAPACITY BY HS EPIFAUNA WOULD APPROACH RENEWAL BY ADVECTION/MIXING, M. EDULIS INDIVIDUALS WOULD LIKELY GROW TO A SMALLER-THAN-DESIRED COMMERCIAL SIZE. IN THE SAME SCENARIO, BENTHIC ORGANIC CARBON MINERALISATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BOOSTED DUE TO INCREASED ORGANIC MATTER DEPOSITION BY THE AQUACULTURE SET-UP. COMBINING THESE RESULTS WITH IN SITU OWF ABUNDANCE DATA CONFIRMED M.

WHILE THIS WILL IMPROVE GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY, CONTRIBUTE TO THE BLUE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS LOCALLY, THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE MASSIVE. THE EXISTING LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED INTO THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS WHICH HOST AQUACULTURE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A CHOICE EXPERIMENT SURVEY OF NORWEGIAN HOUSEHOLDS' TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN SALMON PRODUCTION AND JOB CREATION, AND THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT. MOST RESPONDENTS WERE AT THE OUTSET NEUTRAL OR SUPPORTIVE OF PLANS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, WHEN INFORMED ABOUT POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN TERMS OF MARINE PLASTICS AND SALMON LICE AFFECTING WILD SALMON STOCKS, AND ASKED TO TRADE THESE OFF AGAINST THE POSITIVE EFFECTS, THE MAJORITY OPPOSED THE PLANS AND EXPRESSED A POSITIVE WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY TO AVOID THE PLANNED EXPANSION. APPLYING A HYBRID MIXED MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL WE FIND THAT INCOME, EDUCATION AND TO SOME EXTENT AGE, ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES, EXPLAIN MOST OF THE VARIATION IN PEOPLE'S PREFERENCES. SUPPORT FOR LARGE AQUACULTURE EXPANSION IS HIGHER AMONG PEOPLE WHO CONSUME FARMED SALMON FREQUENTLY AND THOSE LIVING IN AREAS WITH A HIGH DENSITY OF AQUACULTURE FARMS. HENCE, WE DO NOT FIND THE SO-CALLED “NOT IN MY BACKYARD” (NIMBY) EFFECT.

THERE IS EVER INCREASING DEMAND ON THE COASTAL ZONE BY TOURISTS, RESIDENTS AND DEVELOPERS ALIKE; IT IS NAMED AS THE FASTEST GROWING SECTOR OF THE BLUE ECONOMY. HENCE, COASTAL ZONE PROCESSES REQUIRE BETTER UNDERSTANDING TO BE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASSET. WHILE SEA LEVEL MAY BE RISING OVER THE LONG-TERM, AND MANY GLOBAL-RESOLUTION STUDIES LAMENT THE LOSS OF SANDY BEACHES AS A RESULT, COASTAL MANAGERS WORK OVER FAR SHORTER TIME-SCALES THUS REQUIRE SITE SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO MANAGE THE COASTAL ZONE ON A DAILY AND MONTHLY BASIS. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION WE DISCUSS NINE YEARS OF MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGE ALONG A SANDY BEACH IN DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA. THE BEACH IS MANAGED BY THE ETHEKWINI MUNICIPALITY WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING A COASTAL ZONE OF CA. 100 KM. THE MORPHOLOGICAL DATA OF THIS STUDY WERE COLLECTED ON A NEAR MONTHLY BASIS OVER 9.6 KM OF SANDY BEACH BETWEEN OCTOBER 2011 AND MARCH 2020. FROM THESE DATA, BEACH VOLUME AND AREA ARE CALCULATED AND THE VARIATION IS DOCUMENTED OVER TIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH WAVE DATA RECORDED FROM A PROXIMAL DIRECTIONAL WAVE BUOY. OVER THE STUDY PERIOD, THE BEACH HAS EXPERIENCED A NET LOSS OF 177885M3 AND 29,375 M2 IN VOLUME AND AREA RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, THE BEACH RESPONSE HAS NOT BEEN UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE STUDY AREA. THE SOUTHERN THREE-QUARTERS OF THE BEACH WERE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WHILE THE NORTHERN ONE-QUARTER GAINED IN VOLUME AND AREA OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE SUMMER WAVE CLIMATE IS CHARACTERISED BY INCREASED VARIABILITY IN SWELL ORIGIN WITH GREATER EASTERLY CONTRIBUTIONS THAN OTHER SEASONS, AND TYPICALLY LACKS THE FREQUENCY OF LARGE SWELL (>3.5 M) EVENTS (7% OF EVENTS) COMMON TO AUTUMN (20%), WINTER (35%) AND SPRING (38%). WINTER, FOLLOWED BY SPRING THEN AUTUMN SEASONS HAVE MORE FOCUSED SWELL ORIGINS AND SOUTHERLY CONTRIBUTION, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF LARGE SWELL EVENTS. DURING PERIODS OF REDUCED EVENT FREQUENCY ALLOW FOR PARTIAL BEACH RECOVERY, WHILE EROSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH PERIODS OF INCREASE EVENT FREQUENCY. THE SEDIMENT BUDGET HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THOUGH IMPOUNDMENTS ON THE PROXIMAL RIVER CATCHMENT, COMPOUNDED BY UN-MANAGED SAND MINING. RATHER THAN SEA LEVEL, THESE NEAR-FIELD CONTROLS ON SEDIMENT AVAILABILITY LIKELY PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN BEACH VOLUME AND AREA IN RESPONSE TO WAVE CLIMATE.

RESULTS DEMONSTRATE HOW ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL FORESIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERS FROM TRADITIONAL FORESIGHT CENTERED AROUND A FOCAL FIRM. CORPORATE FORESIGHT TOOLS, AS APPLIED TO AN ECOSYSTEM: 1) TARGET A DIVERSE SET OF ECOSYSTEM ACTORS BEYOND THE SEGMENT'S FOCAL FIRM, INCLUDING COMPLEMENTARY FIRMS, INVESTORS, AND NON-MARKET ACTORS; 2) ENGAGE ECOSYSTEM ACTORS, RATHER THAN ONLY THE FOCAL FIRM, IN SHARED STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT BASED ON A DIVERSE MIX OF FORESIGHT TOOLS; AND 3) SERVE TO ORIENT AND REIFY THE ECOSYSTEM BY CHARTING THE COLLECTIVE ANTICIPATION OF INNOVATIONS, POLICIES, ETC., IN A SHARED SET OF FUTURE OPTIONS.

AT THE SAME TIME, A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF GLOBAL MARINE WATER BODIES HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM EUTROPHICATION DUE TO EXCESSIVE NUTRIENT LOADING. THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A VALUABLE PHOSPHORUS SOURCE DUE TO NUTRIENT RICH EUTROPHIC SEAWATER AND SEDIMENT WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY SERVE AS PHOSPHORUS MINES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HENCE, SUSTAINABLE PHOSPHORUS RECOVERY STRATEGIES SHOULD BE ADAPTED FOR MARINE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE PHOSPHORUS FOR THE GROWING MARKET DEMAND AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTROL EUTROPHICATION. IN THIS REVIEW, POSSIBLE SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES FOR PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL AND RECOVERY FROM MARINE ENVIRONMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. BIO-BASED STRATEGIES RELYING ON NATURAL PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE/RELEASE METABOLISM OF LIVING ORGANISMS ARE SUGGESTED AS PROMISING OPTIONS THAT CAN PROVIDE BOTH PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL AND RECOVERY FROM MARINE WATERS FOR ACHIEVING A SUSTAINABLE MARINE ECOSYSTEM. AMONG THEM, THE UTILIZATION OF MICROORGANISMS SEEMS PROMISING TO DEVELOP NOVEL STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH GAP FOR THE TECHNICAL APPLICABILITY OF THESE STRATEGIES IS STILL CONSIDERABLY BIG. THEREFORE, FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON THE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRATEGIES THROUGH LABORATORY AND/OR FIELD STUDIES. COUPLING PHOSPHORUS MINING WITH OTHER VALORISATION PATHWAYS (I.E., METAL RECOVERY, ENERGY PRODUCTION) IS ALSO SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE OVERALL SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY.

THE DATA ARE COLLECTED VIA SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH THE FOUNDERS/MANAGERS AND ANALYZED USING THE GIOIA METHOD. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT FAMILY SMES APPROACH SUSTAINABILITY BY ADOPTING THREE MANAGERIAL APPROACHES. IN THE FIRST APPROACH, SME MANAGERS CONCEIVE SUSTAINABILITY AS A THREAT TO THE ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY OF THEIR FIRMS. THE SECOND APPROACH IMPLIES THAT SUSTAINABILITY MUST UNDERGO SPECIFIC COMPROMISES. THE THIRD APPROACH CONSIDERS SUSTAINABILITY AS AN OPPORTUNITY WHEREBY SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY GOALS ARE BALANCED.

CONSIDERING THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY DISCARDS HALF OF ITS FISH-PRODUCT MASS IN THE OCEAN, A PROPER VALORIZATION OF ITS RESIDUES WOULD DECREASE NOT ONLY THE OCEAN CONTAMINATION BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF MARINE RESOURCES AND INCREASE THE SECTOR COMPETITIVENESS. WITH THESE GOALS IN MIND, OCEAN-BASED INDUSTRIES ARE ADOPTING NEW SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION MODELS, SIMILAR TO BIOREFINERIES, WHICH ARE EFFECTIVE FOR WASTE VALORIZATION, NAMELY, CONVERTING LOW-VALUE BIOMASS INTO COMMERCIALLY RELEVANT BY-PRODUCTS. BASED ON A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF AQUATIC FEEDSTOCKS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A MARINE BIOREFINERY CAN BE FUNDAMENTAL TO CONSOLIDATE A ""GREENER""SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED IN GREEN CHEMISTRY.

THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH GENERATING WEALTH FROM OCEAN-RELATED ACTIVITIES WHILE PROTECTING AND SUPPORTING MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. FOR REMOTE COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES, LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS A CHALLENGING BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING MARINE BIODIVERSITY AND MAINTAINING SUSTAINABLE AND DIRECT ACCESS TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT RESULTS OF A STUDY IN THE COASTAL REGION OF SOUTH SULAWESI PROVINCE, INDONESIA IN THE CORAL TRIANGLE. THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES THAT COMMUNITY-BASED ECOTOURISM SUPPORTS SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE RESOURCES AND OFFERS AN ENTRY POINT FOR LOW-RESOURCE COASTAL COMMUNITIES TO TAKE PART IN THE BLUE ECONOMY. COMPLEMENTARY LIVELIHOOD PATHWAYS THAT ENHANCE PRIMARY INCOME AND SUPPORT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PLAY A KEY ROLE. STUDY FINDINGS SHOW THAT THREE KEY AREAS WHERE MULTILATERAL SUPPORT IS MOST NEEDED FOR COMMUNITIES WITH ECOTOURISM ASPIRATIONS ARE: WASTE MANAGEMENT, HOSPITALITY SKILLS, AND MARKET ACCESS. FROM THESE FINDINGS, WE PRESENT A MODEL FOR COMMUNITY-BASED ECOTOURISM IN THE BLUE ECONOMY. THE MODEL DEMONSTRATES IMPORTANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITY, THE LOCAL ECONOMY, AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS, AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE COMMUNITY-BASED ECOTOURISM PLAYS IN CREATING EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR PRESERVING NATURAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE. © 2020, © 2020 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.",NA,"A.

WHILE POWERFUL NUMBERS ARE COMMONLY EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED THROUGH THE PROCEDURES OF ‘MECHANICAL OBJECTIVITY’ THAT INVOLVE STRICT QUANTIFICATION AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS, OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS A RATHER DIFFERENT ROUTE TOWARDS A POWERFUL NUMBER: BY LOOSELY COMBINING TOOLS DEVELOPED FOR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, THE NUMBER IS CALCULATED BY, FIRST, OPENLY COMBINING QUALITATIVE AND NARRATIVE OPERATIONS INTO THE CALCULATION AND THEN, NEXT, DECOUPLING QUALITATIVE UNCERTAINTIES FROM THE QUANTIFIED POTENTIAL.

SPOROPHYTE HEIGHT (M), WET BIOMASS (KG), MAXIMUM (D) AND MINIMUM (D) HOLDFAST DISK WIDTHS (CM) WERE MEASURED IN THE FIELD. IN THE LABORATORY, C CONTENT WAS MEASURED TO CALCULATE THE BEST-FITTING COEFFICIENTS FOR FUTURE ESTIMATIONS BY USING ALLOMETRIC EQUATIONS. INDIVIDUAL BIOMASS WAS BEST ESTIMATED FROM SPOROPHYTE HEIGHT THROUGH A RATIONAL MODEL, WHILE HOLDFAST AREA (ELLIPSE IN CM2) WAS A GOOD PROXY OF BIOMASS WITH A SINUSOIDAL MODEL.

TO PROVIDE A FIRST COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE SITUATION, WE REVIEW 3187 ARTICLES TO MAP AND ANALYZE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT OCEAN SECTORS AND FIND 93 UNIQUE DIRECT AND 61 INDIRECT INTERACTIONS, OFTEN MEDIATED VIA THE OCEAN ECOSYSTEM. ANALYSIS OF INTERACTION OUTCOMES REVEALS THAT SOME SECTORS COEXIST SYNERGISTICALLY (E.G. RENEWABLE ENERGY, TOURISM), BUT MANY INTERACTIONS ARE ANTAGONISTIC, AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OTHER SECTORS ARE OFTEN INCURRED VIA DEGRADATION OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS THAT OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS ARE FUNDAMENTAL FOR SUPPORTING MANY OCEAN SECTORS, YET 13 OUT OF 14 OCEAN SECTORS HAVE INTERACTIONS RESULTING IN UNIDIRECTIONAL NEGATIVE ECOSYSTEM IMPACT. FISHING, DRILLING, AND SHIPPING ARE HUBS IN THE NETWORK OF OCEAN SECTOR INTERACTIONS, AND ARE INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS. ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS SIGNAL TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN SECTORS. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT THESE TRADEOFFS RELATE TO THE CUMULATIVE NATURE OF MANY ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS INCURRED BY SOME SECTORS, AND THE DIFFERENTIAL POWER OF OCEAN SECTORS TO EXERT THEIR RIGHTS OR DEMANDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OCEAN DOMAIN.

IMPORTANT ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS INCLUDE CAPACITY-BUILDING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION. THIS INCLUDES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OCEAN-BASED RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF A HEALTHY PLANET AND OCEAN. OFFSHORE WIND IS EXPERIENCING RAPID DEVELOPMENT GLOBALLY AND, WHILE THE U.S. OFFSHORE WIND MARKET IS STILL NASCENT, IT IS ON THE BRINK OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH BASED ON LARGE COST REDUCTIONS DRIVEN LARGELY BY EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES. GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN WAVE AND TIDAL ENERGY WITH SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED FOR VARIOUS DISTRIBUTED MARKETS THROUGH THE POWERING THE BLUE ECONOMY™ INITIATIVE, WITH LONGER-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR EXPANSION AT THE UTILITY SCALE (LIVECCHI ET AL 2019 POWERING THE BLUE ECONOMY; EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY IN MARITIME MARKETS P 207). IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE PROGRESS AND MAXIMIZE BENEFITS TO THE NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL ECONOMIES, THESE DEVELOPMENT ACTIONS WILL REQUIRE A BROAD, DIVERSE, AND APPROPRIATELY TRAINED WORKFORCE. THE OCEAN-BASED RENEWABLE ENERGY WORKFORCE NEEDS ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS TO DEVELOP COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS TRADE AND MARITIME WORKERS TO EVENTUALLY DEPLOY THE TECHNOLOGIES AT SCALE. IN THE UNITED STATES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, STATE GOVERNMENTS, AND PRIVATE DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING ACTION TO UNDERSTAND JOB SKILLS AND CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET OFFSHORE WORKFORCE NEEDS; MOST ARE FOCUSED ON OFFSHORE WIND POWER, WITH GAINING INTEREST IN MARINE ENERGY. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS OF THE GROWING OCEAN-BASED RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY AND THE CURRENT STATE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY GAPS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND INITIATIVES. AN INTERNATIONAL VIEW NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED THAT INCORPORATES THE EDUCATION AND SKILL NEEDS OF EARLY-STAGE MARINE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND EVOLVING OFFSHORE WIND TECHNOLOGIES TOGETHER WITH MORE MARKET-READY OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY MARKETS. BY ACCELERATING EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN OCEAN-BASED RENEWABLE ENERGY, THESE GROWING BLUE ECONOMY MARKETS CAN DELIVER SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS. © 2021 IOP PUBLISHING LTD.",NA,"C.

REPRESENTING ALMOST HALF OF GLOBAL PRODUCTION, MARINE AQUACULTURE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLY FEEDING THE GROWING HUMANITY. HOWEVER, CLIMATE CHANGE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CHALLENGE THE FUTURE GROWTH OF MARINE AQUACULTURE. TEMPERATURE AND SEA-LEVEL RISE, SHIFTS IN PRECIPITATION, FRESHENING FROM GLACIER MELT, CHANGING OCEAN PRODUCTIVITY, AND CIRCULATION PATTERNS, INCREASING OCCURRENCE OF EXTREME CLIMATIC EVENTS, EUTROPHICATION, AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ARE ALL STRESSORS THAT WILL INFLUENCE MARINE AQUACULTURE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS THEMED ARTICLE SET WAS TO BRING TOGETHER CONTRIBUTIONS ON THE BROAD THEME OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS, ADAPTATION, AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES OF MARINE AQUACULTURE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. HERE WE PRESENT 14 PAPERS COVERING A DIVERSE SET OF APPROACHES INCLUDING EXPERIMENTATION, MODELLING, META-ANALYSIS AND REVIEW, AND DISCIPLINES LIKE BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, ECONOMICS, AND ENGINEERING. THESE ARTICLES FOCUS ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED STRESSORS ON THE AQUACULTURE POTENTIAL ITSELF AND ON THE RESULTING ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS (E.G. PARASITISM AND PREDATION), ON PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AND ADAPTATION POTENTIAL OF SPECIES, AND ON MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AQUACULTURE AND VICE VERSA. CONSIDERING THIS, ADAPTATION OF THE AQUACULTURE SECTOR RELIES ON ANTICIPATING THE BIOGEOGRAPHICAL CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES, DETERMINING THEIR POTENTIAL FOR ADAPTATION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING FOR RESISTANCE OR TOLERANCE TO CLIMATE-INDUCED STRESSORS, AND FOSTERING ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE BY MEANS OF CONSERVATION, RESTORATION, OR REMEDIATION. BY WILL OR BY FORCE, AQUACULTURE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOW CARBON ECONOMY OF TOMORROW.

THIS IS REPRESENTED IN THE CYBER-PHYSICAL CONTEXT, IN WHICH HUMANS AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALLOWED TO COEXIST AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN SECTOR CONSISTS OF NUMEROUS PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, AND DESPITE THE LIMITED INCLUSION OF AUTOMATION AND AI WITHIN THE SECTOR, THERE ARE STILL MANY MANUAL AND REPETITIVE TASKS. FINDINGS: STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN SECTOR ARE CREATING AWARENESS AND SLOWLY IMPLEMENTING AI AND AUTOMATION WITHIN THEIR OPERATIONS. THE MAJORITY OF SHIPPING AND LOGISTICS IS DONE THROUGH THE MARITIME SECTOR, AND THIS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN LINE WITH THE WORLD’S POPULATION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: RESEARCH WAS LIMITED TO JAMAICA AND A FEW OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE CARIBBEAN. BROADENING THE SCOPE TO INCLUDE OTHER REGIONAL SHIPPING AND LOGISTICS INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS WOULD BE HELPFUL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE REMOVAL OF SOMETIMES MUNDANE AND EVEN MORE COMPLEX MANUAL PROCESSES IN THE LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN WILL GIVE RISE TO MORE EFFICIENCIES AND POSSIBLY INCREASED REVENUE.

THE CRITERIA WERE CHARACTERISED BY THE USE OF INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE, FIELD DATA, LITERATURE ON BREEDING SITES, MACROINVERTEBRATES DISTRIBUTION, LARVAL AND RELATIVE FISH ABUNDANCES, DIGITISATION, PARTICIPATORY MAPPING, AND PERIODIC SAMPLING. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM TRAWL AND SEINE NET SURVEYS. DIGITISATION AND MAPPING OF THE PROPOSED CONSERVATION SITES WERE CARRIED OUT USING QUANTUM GIS SOFTWARE. PARTICIPATORY PHYSICAL DEMARCATION OF SITES WAS DONE USING BUOYS AND MARKERS. LARVAL AND JUVENILE FISHES WERE DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT IN ALL SEVEN RIVER MOUTHS AND SIX BAYS SURVEYED WITH LITTLE VARIANCE; AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF BREEDING AREAS. ADDITIONALLY, A PREPONDERANCE OF MACROINVERTEBRATES AND HIGH FISH DIVERSITY COMPARED WITH OFFSHORE SITES IN THE LAKE STRENGTHENED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THESE ARE CRITICAL HABITATS FOR SPAWNING AND PREFERRED HABITATS FOR NURSERIES FOR FISH.

OCEAN CLIMATE CHANGE (‘CC’) MODELLING MAY BECOME A KEY DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL FOR MSP, BUT TRADITIONAL MODELLING ANALYSIS AND COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES PREVENT THEIR BROAD UPTAKE. WE EMPLOYED MSP-SPECIFIC OCEAN CLIMATE MODELLING ANALYSES TO INFORM A REAL-LIFE MSP PROCESS; ADDRESSING HOW NATURE CONSERVATION AND FISHERIES COULD BE ADAPTED TO CC. WE FOUND THAT THE CURRENTLY PLANNED DISTRIBUTION OF THESE ACTIVITIES MAY BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE DURING THE POLICY'S IMPLEMENTATION DUE TO CC, LEADING TO A SHORTFALL IN ITS SUSTAINABILITY AND BLUE GROWTH TARGETS. SIGNIFICANT, CLIMATE-DRIVEN ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL SHIFTS IN OCEAN COMPONENTS UNDERPINNING DESIGNATED SITES AND FISHING ACTIVITY WERE ESTIMATED, REFLECTING DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES OF SHIFTS IN BENTHIC VERSUS PELAGIC, AND INSHORE VERSUS OFFSHORE HABITATS. SUPPORTING ADAPTATION, WE THEN IDENTIFIED: CC REFUGIA (AREAS WHERE THE ECOSYSTEM REMAINS WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF ITS PRESENT STATE); CC HOTSPOTS (WHERE CLIMATE DRIVES THE ECOSYSTEM TOWARDS A NEW STATE, INCONSISTENT WITH EACH SECTORS’ PRESENT USE DISTRIBUTION); AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, IDENTIFIED BRIGHT SPOTS (AREAS WHERE OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES DRIVE RANGE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN THE MEDIUM TERM). WE THUS CREATE THE MEANS TO: IDENTIFY WHERE SECTOR-RELEVANT ECOSYSTEM CHANGE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CC; INCORPORATE RESILIENT DELIVERY OF CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT AIMS INTO MSP; AND TO HARNESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLUE GROWTH WHERE THEY EXIST. CAPTURING CC BRIGHT SPOTS ALONGSIDE REFUGIA WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS MAY PRESENT IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS WHILE HELPING SUPPORT THE FISHING SECTOR IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. BY CAPITALIZING ON THE NATURAL DISTRIBUTION OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE WITHIN OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS, SUCH CLIMATE-ADAPTIVE SPATIAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES COULD BE SEEN AS NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF CC ON OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS AND DEPENDENT BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS, PAVING THE WAY FOR CLIMATE-SMART MSP. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

COASTAL FISHERIES IN JAPAN ARE OFTEN IDEALIZED AS ONE OF THE LAST BASTIONS OF RESOURCE CO-MANAGEMENT IN AN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY, WITH LOCAL COOPERATIVES COLLECTIVELY CONTROLLING TERRITORIAL FISHING RIGHTS. HOWEVER, DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE, DECLINING PROFITABILITY, AND DWINDLING RESOURCE STOCKS ARE CHALLENGING THEIR VIABILITY. REFORM OF THE FISHERY LAW, DESIGNED TO STIMULATE NEW GROWTH AND INDUSTRIALIZATION – PARTICULARLY IN AQUACULTURE – INCLUDES THE OPENING UP OF COASTAL FISHERY RESOURCES TO CORPORATE INVESTORS, THE STRENGTHENING OF TOP-DOWN REGULATION, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL FISHING QUOTAS (IQ). THE DESIRE TO BOOST DOMESTIC SEAFOOD PRODUCTION ALSO HAS TO BE SEEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DOUBLE ANXIETY OF HIGH DEPENDENCY ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE FOR FOODSTUFF AND OF JAPAN'S VANISHING RURALITY. THIS EMPHASIS ON PRIVATE CAPITAL AND PRESUPPOSED ECONOMIC AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALITY BUILDS ON THE SAME RATIONALE OF BLUE ECONOMY AND BLUE GROWTH DISCOURSES, WHICH PROMISE FINANCIAL ALONG WITH ECOLOGICAL RETURNS ON LARGE-SCALE INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABLE OCEAN ECONOMIES. GROWTH-ORIENTED REFORM IN JAPAN NOW IMPERILS SUCCESSFUL RESOURCE CO-MANAGEMENT IN COASTAL SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES. ITS ANALYSIS THEREFORE OFFERS DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO THE TRANSFORMATIVE AS WELL AS DISPOSSESSIVE POTENTIAL OF THE GLOBAL PARADIGMATIC SHIFT TOWARDS AN INTENSIFIED INDUSTRIAL EXPLOITATION OF THE OCEANS. THE QUESTION OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS CENTRAL IN THE RE-ALLOCATION OF ACCESS RIGHTS TO OCEAN SPACES AND RESOURCES AND THE RE-ARRANGEMENT OF DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES IN FISHERY GOVERNANCE, AS LOCAL FISHING COMMUNITIES FACE A VERY REAL THREAT OF DISPOSSESSION AND DISEMPOWERMENT.

DRAWING FROM A REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS AND DECLARATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, THE RESEARCH ANALYSES COMMUNITIES' CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF DESALINATION. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED (1) LACK OF MEANINGFUL INCLUSION IN DECISION-MAKING; (2) PHYSICAL DISPLACEMENT OF COMMUNITIES OR FROM AREAS REQUIRED FOR LIVELIHOODS; (3) CONCERNS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS, AND RELATED SOCIAL IMPACTS; AND (4) FEW SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO LOCAL PEOPLE. THE RESEARCH CONCLUDES THAT DESALINATION IS A SECTOR OF THE BLUE ECONOMY THAT IS OPENING A NEW SPHERE OF DISPOSSESSION IN THE OCEANS.

IN RESPONSE TO THE LIMITED ATTENTION PAID TO THE SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITABLE GOVERNANCE APPROACHES OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, A US ‘BLUE NEW DEAL’ HAS BEEN PROPOSED AIMING TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE OCEAN AND SUPPORT COASTAL COMMUNITIES' ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE BLUE NEW DEAL EMERGED AS A CENTRAL POLICY PROPOSAL FROM 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ELIZABETH WARREN TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THROUGH A JUST TRANSITIONS ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR A US BLUE NEW DEAL — AS DESIGNED BY SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN — THAT WOULD BE APPLIED TOWARDS ENHANCING SOCIOECONOMIC RESILIENCY, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, AND ADDRESSING SOCIAL INEQUITIES. AS PART OF A CRITICAL POLICY ANALYSIS EVALUATING THE AREAS OF FOCUS WARREN'S BLUE NEW DEAL PRESENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND SUSTAINABILITY ARE CENTRAL TO THE SUCCESS OF MANAGING, AND ENHANCING THE ROLE OF, THE BLUE ECONOMY. THE CHALLENGES FACING THE BLUE NEW DEAL REFLECT A ‘ONE SIZE FITS ALL’ FEDERAL APPROACH THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR ADDRESSING MULTIFACETED OBSTACLES IN KEY SECTORS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, ITS GOVERNANCE, AND TACKLING INTERCONNECTED CRISES THAT EXACERBATE SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUITIES AND VULNERABILITIES OF MARGINALISED COASTAL COMMUNITIES. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A BLUE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK FOR THE BLUE NEW DEAL THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE TENSIONS AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND INDICATES HOW A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY FRAMEWORK CAN ENHANCE THE SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITABLE INVOLVEMENT OF THE BLUE ECONOMY.

ASSESSING STAKEHOLDER SYSTEMS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO COASTAL RESOURCES IS IMPERATIVE FOR UNDERSTANDING DYNAMICS THAT MAY PROMOTE OR HINDER JUST TRANSFORMATION. TAKING AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO WORKING ALONGSIDE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH TRANSITIONAL PROCESSES, THUS BUILDING CAPACITY, IS NEEDED TO GENERATE MOMENTUM TOWARD JUST TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE.

J.,"WHILE THE OCEAN SPACE HAS LONG BEEN IGNORED BY SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE PAST 15 YEARS HAVE WITNESSED AN INCREASED INTEREST IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT BY SCHOLARS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY. THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON THE BLUE ECONOMY, ALMOST NON-EXISTENT A FEW YEARS AGO, IS NOW BURGEONING. THE ACADEMIC DEBATE HAS OFFERED SOME CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF BLUE ECONOMY INITIATIVES, BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THE TRUE PLACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WITHIN A BLUE ECONOMY, AND TO PUT PEOPLE AT THE CENTRE OF CONCERNS AND ANALYSES. OF PARTICULAR CONCERN, IS THE AMBIGUITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT AND THE CONFUSION OVER ITS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, WHICH CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN HARMFUL PRACTICES. AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS THEN HOW SHOULD SOCIAL SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL AND GEOGRAPHERS, SPECIFICALLY, ENGAGE WITH THESE DEBATES, AND IN PARTICULAR HOW SHOULD THE POTENTIAL HUMAN AND SOCIAL COSTS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY BE INVESTIGATED AND ADDRESSED WHILE ASSURING JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS? THE PAPERS PRESENTED HERE SHARE THE VISION THAT ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, JUSTICE AND EQUALITY SHOULD BE AT THE HEART OF THE BLUE ECONOMY; NOT JUST CONCEPTUALLY, BUT PRACTICALLY TOO. THE PAPERS PURSUE EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY BLUE ECONOMY RISKS AND THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH THEY OCCUR; ASSESS THE PLACE OF INCLUSION AND PARTICIPATION IN A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY; DEFINE WHAT BLUE ECONOMY POLICIES SHOULD INCLUDE TO DRIVE JUST AND SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES; AND IDENTIFY WHERE THE DOMINANT UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY AND ITS PRIORITIES ARE COMING FROM. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY PUT CONSIDERATIONS OF JUSTICE AND BROADER CULTURAL STRUCTURES AT THE CENTRE OF THEIR CONCERNS AND ANALYSIS. THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO BYPASS GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES AND GAIN INSIGHTS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND METHODOLOGIES TO GRASP SUCH AN ENCOMPASSING CONCEPT, AND FOSTER NOT JUST A BLUE ECONOMY WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE, BUT A BLUE ECONOMY FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE.

IN 2014, EU MEMBER STATES SET NEW STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AND AMBITIOUS TARGETS OF PRODUCTIONS TO BE MET BY 2020 IN THE THREE SEGMENTS, MARINE FISH, FRESHWATER FISH AND SHELLFISH. A RECENT ASSESSMENT MADE BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CONCLUDES THAT SOME COUNTRIES MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ATTAIN THE ESTABLISHED GOALS AND THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF SUCH STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY THE SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS HAMPERING AQUACULTURE GROWTH IN FRANCE, ITALY AND SPAIN AS WELL AS THE MEASURES ESTABLISHED TO OVERCOME THEM. MOST OF THE IDENTIFIED ISSUES ARE RELATED TO THE SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES, LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMERS, SUGGESTING THAT THIS STILL REPRESENTS AN UNSOLVED ISSUE HAMPERING AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPE.

THIS STUDY PROPOSES AN OCEAN WAVE POWERED REVERSE OSMOSIS DESALINATION SYSTEM, WHICH CONSISTS OF AN OSCILLATING SURGE WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER WITH A PISTON PUMP AND A REVERSE OSMOSIS DESALINATION MODULE WITH AN ACCUMULATOR ON THE SHORE. SEAWATER CAN BE PRESSURIZED BY THE OSCILLATING SURGE WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER AND PUMPED TO THE REVERSE OSMOSIS DESALINATION MODULE AS FEED WHERE IT THEN PRODUCES PERMEATE THAT IS FREE OF UNDESIRED MOLECULES AND LARGER PARTICLES. NUMERICAL MODELS CONSIDERING POTENTIAL FLOW THEORY OF THE WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER AND SOLUTION-DIFFUSION THEORY OF THE REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANE WERE ESTABLISHED. A 1:10 SCALED PROTOTYPE WAS DESIGNED, FABRICATED AND TESTED IN A WAVE TANK BASED ON THE FROUDE SCALING LAW. COMPREHENSIVE WAVE TANK TESTS WERE IMPLEMENTED, CHARACTERIZED, AND ANALYZED CONSIDERING THE WATER-ENERGY NEXUS. SCALED TESTS RESULTED IN THE MINIMAL SPECIFIC ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF 0.44 KWℎ/M3 UNDER REGULAR WAVE (WAVE PERIOD TS = 4S WAVE HEIGHT HS = 10 CM WITH THE CORRESPONDING OPTIMAL RECOVERY RATIO OF 32%. © 2022 BY ASME.",NA,NA,NA,978-079188631-1,NA,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCE,ENGLISH,1,NA,NA,NA,FINAL,AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS (ASME),SCOPUS,"MODELLING, CHARACTERIZATION AND TESTING OF AN OCEAN WAVE POWERED DESALINATION SYSTEM",CONFERENCE PAPER,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142664614&doi=10.1115%2fDETC2022-91285&partnerID=40&md5=309cd3eef666a33218ba0bc6f0563a04,10,2022,PROC ASME DES ENG TECH CONF,none,VIRGINIA TECH;STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,VIRGINIA TECH;STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,NA,"MI J, 2022, PROC ASME DES ENG TECH CONF","MI J, 2022, PROC ASME DES ENG TECH CONF"

THIS FACT ACTIVATED AN ORIGINAL RESEARCH EFFORT TO STUDY WHETHER THE POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISTORTIONS IN THE ISLAND WERE TO BE IDENTIFIED SO THAT A TOURISM POLICY COULD BE ADAPTED TO THE ISLAND'S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. DURING THE DATA COLLECTION, TOURIST ACCOMMODATION WAS RECORDED IN ALL LEFKADA'S MUNICIPALITIES BY ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION OF NATURAL, CULTURAL, HUMAN AND ARTIFICIAL ENVIRONMENT. THE RESULTING DATA WERE FURTHER PROCESSED WITH SOFTWARE PROGRAMS AND SHOWED THAT THE GEOLOGICAL SPECIFICITY OF LEFKADA'S ISLAND AFFECTS THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL AND SEASONAL TOURIST POPULATIONS. AS AN IMPACT OF THIS, THE POTENTIAL ZONES OF PRESSURE IN LEFKADA ARE SEPARATED INTO COASTAL OUTER ZONE AND TWO INNER, SEMI-MOUNTAINOUS ZONES. THE COASTAL ZONE RECEIVES THE HIGHEST PRESSURE AND HAS THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL FOR POLLUTION, MAINLY ON THE NORTH AND EAST SIDES OF THE ISLAND, DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF PORTS AND NATURAL ANCHORS AND THE EXPLOSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL AND MULTI-PURPOSE TOURIST ACCOMMODATION WITHIN 2 KM OF THE COASTLINE. SEMI-MOUNTAINOUS AREAS THAT MAY BE PRONE TO LAND USE PROBLEMS HAVE ALSO BEEN SURVEYED DUE TO THE GROWING TOURISM SPATIAL ACTIVITY.

IN THIS STUDY, THE ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTIGLYCEMIC PROPERTIES ALONG WITH ITS POLYSACCHARIDE AND TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT OF FIFTEEN SELECTED MACROALGAE FROM THE INDIAN COAST WAS EVALUATED. THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY WAS ASSESSED BASED ON THE RADICAL SCAVENGING AND REDUCING POWER EFFICIENCY AND THE ANTIGLYCEMIC ACTIVITY WAS DETERMINED BASED ON ITS Α-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITION CAPACITY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PTEROCLADIA CAPILLACEA (RHODOPHYTA) AND STOECHOSPERMUM MARGINATUM AND SPHACELARIA RIGIDULA (PHAEOPHYTA) EXHIBITED GOOD ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTIGLYCEMIC ACTIVITY, EQUIVALENT TO MODEL COMPOUNDS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN BOTH THESE ACTIVITIES AND THE TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT.

RUSS.,"ABSTRACT—ONE OF THE MODERN GLOBAL TRENDS IS THE ACCELERATED FORMATION OF A “BLUE ECONOMY” BASED ON TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS, RESOURCE AND RAW MATERIALS, AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES OF THE SEAS AND OCEANS, WHICH OCCUPY MORE THAN 70% OF THE EARTH’S SURFACE. THE ARTICLE SUBSTANTIATES THE GROWTH IN THE IMPORTANCE OF MARITIME ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FOR THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND EMPHASIZES THE PECULIARITIES OF REALIZING ITS INTERESTS IN THE WORLD OCEAN, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FOREIGN POLICY, MARKETING AND ECONOMIC, TECHNICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL, FINANCIAL AND INVESTMENT, INFRASTRUCTURAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS. ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE FACTORS AND FEATURES OF THE DYNAMICS AND SPATIAL LOCALIZATION OF SUCH IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES FOR RUSSIA AS SEAPORTS AND LOGISTICS, HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION ON SEA SHELVES, PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OF MARINE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES, SHIPBUILDING, AND COASTAL INDUSTRY. IT IS SHOWN THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, RUSSIA’S SPHERE OF POTENTIAL (DECLARED) INTERESTS IS THE WATERS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD OCEAN AND, ON THE OTHER, THE COUNTRY’S MARITIME ACTIVITY HAS A PREDOMINANTLY CIRCUMEURASIAN (DELIMITING THE MAINLAND CONFINED TO ITS MARGINAL SEAS) CHARACTER, CONSISTENTLY SHIFTING (UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATIC, MARKET, AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS) INTO THE ARCTIC, AS WELL AS THE COASTAL ZONES AND WATER AREAS OF THE FAR EAST.

STILL, IF THE ABUNDANT RESULTS CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY MANAGED AND ARE JUST WASTED, IT WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO BAD THINGS. THIS PROBLEM WAS ALSO FOUND IN SERAYA VILLAGE, KARANGASEM, BALI, WHERE LARGE FISH YIELDS AND THE FISH PROCESSING PROCESS WERE STILL CONSTRAINED BY WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CAUSING THE EXPECTED RESULTS TO NOT BE ACHIEVED. TO OVERCOME THIS, A PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) SYSTEM-BASED FISH DRYER WAS DEVELOPED THAT CAN ASSIST THE FISH DRYING PROCESS. UTILIZATION OF THIS SYSTEM IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY GOOD SOLAR ENERGY POTENTIAL. THE SYSTEM CAN GENERATE 402.78 WH OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY PER DAY, COVERING 104.89% OF THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY DEMAND OF THE FISH DRYER. THE RESULTS OF STATISTICAL TESTS USING THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST FOR FISH WEIGHT AND UNPAIRED T-TEST FOR FISH MOISTURE CONTENT SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT RESULTS (P>0.05). THIS VALUE STATES THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULTS OF DRYING FISH WITH THE PV SYSTEM AND THE TRADITIONAL METHOD. FROM THIS, WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT FISH DRYING USING A SOLAR POWER SYSTEM WORKS SIMILARLY TO CONVENTIONAL FISH DRYING METHODS. © 2023, INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE.

THIS POTENTIAL CAN CERTAINLY BE UTILIZED IN THE MARINE AND FISHERIES WORLD. THE UTILIZATION OF PV AS A SOURCE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY ON FISHING BOATS IS EXPECTED TO HELP SUPPORT GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN TERMS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY AND OVERCOME THE LIMITED NUMBER OF FOSSIL ENERGY SOURCES. IN THIS STUDY, THE INSTALLATION OF PV WITH A SIZE OF 100 WP WAS INSTALLED ON FISHING BOATS. THE NEED FOR ELECTRICAL ENERGY FOR PV ENERGY OUTPUT SHOWS THAT IT CAN MEET 50.52% OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY NEEDS.

EUR.,"BACKGROUND: THE BLUE ECONOMY IS A RECENT FIELD OF STUDY THAT ENCOMPASSES ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES THAT DEPEND ON THE SEA, OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER ECONOMIC SECTORS, INCLUDING TOURISM, MARITIME TRANSPORT, ENERGY AND FISHING. BLUE GROWTH SUPPORTS THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF THE MARITIME AND MARINE SECTORS AS THE OCEANS AND SEAS ARE ENGINES OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND INNOVATION. THIS ARTICLE UNDERTAKES A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS IN THE TERMS OF BLUE ECONOMY (BE), MARITIME ECONOMY (MAE), OCEAN ECONOMY (OE), MARINE ECONOMY (ME), AND BLUE GROWTH (BG) TO ANALYZE THE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION OF THIS FIELD OF STUDY. ANALYSIS OF THE AUTHORS’ DEFINITIONS OF BE, BG, ME AND OE PROVIDES INTERESTING RELATIONSHIPS DIVIDED INTO SUSTAINABILITY AND GOVERNANCE; ECONOMICS AND ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION; INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND LOCALIZATION; AND THE GROWTH OF THE OCEAN ECONOMY, WITH DEVELOPMENT AS THE CENTRAL AXIS THAT ENCOMPASSES THEM. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION IS TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE BE AND THE CE THROUGH THE KEYWORD STUDY. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ARTICLES AND CITATIONS OVER THE LAST DECADE. THE ARTICLES ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT SECTORS OF BE AND THE INTEREST OF GOVERNMENTS IN PROMOTING IT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR NATIONAL ECONOMIES. USING BIBLIOMETRIC MAPPING TOOLS (VOSVIEWER), IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN CONCEPTS SUCH AS CE AND BE THROUGH THE BG AND TO VISUALIZE TRENDING TOPICS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. NASCENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH TRENDS INCLUDE TERMS SUCH AS SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES, AQUATIC SPECIES, BIOFUEL, GROWTH OF THE COASTAL BE, INTERNATIONALIZATION AND BLUE DEGROWTH (BD), THE LATTER APPROACHES ASPECTS OF BG FROM A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE. CONCLUSIONS: IN CONCLUSION, IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR ALLIANCES BETWEEN THE SECTORS THAT COMPOSE BG WITH THE INCORPORATION OF THE CE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABLE BE IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THROUGH THE KEYWORD ANALYSIS IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BG STRATEGY IS THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE BE AND THE CE. THE CE PRESENTS ITSELF AS A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD MITIGATE TENSIONS BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS WHO SUPPORT BOTH GROWTH AND DEGROWTH POSITIONS. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,"R.M.

THIS ATTITUDE HAS PREVIOUSLY SUSTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL RECREATIONAL FISHERY FOR BLUEFIN TUNA WITH ANNUAL TOURNAMENTS IN DENMARK, WHICH PEAKED IN THE 1950S BEFORE THE SUBSEQUENT COLLAPSE OF THE STOCK DURING THE 1960S. SEVERAL SCIENTIFIC TAGGING PROGRAMS HAVE RECRUITED RECREATIONAL ANGLERS IN RECENT YEARS TO HELP CATCH AND RELEASE TAGGED BLUEFIN TUNA. THE ANGLERS’ INVESTMENT OF TIME AND MONEY IN THE SCIENTIFIC TAGGING PROJECTS INDICATE THAT THE RECREATIONAL FISHERY COULD RECOVER IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF A POTENTIAL FUTURE RECREATIONAL BLUEFIN TUNA FISHERY REMAIN UNKNOWN. WE SURVEYED ANGLERS PARTICIPATING IN A SCIENTIFIC CATCH AND RELEASE BLUEFIN TUNA FISHERY IN DENMARK ACROSS THREE YEARS (2018–2020) AND CALCULATED THE TOTAL ANNUAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ESTIMATED THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT (I.E., INCIDENTAL MORTALITIES) ON THE BLUEFIN TUNA STOCK. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT TOTAL ANNUAL EXPENDITURES BY THE RECREATIONAL ANGLERS APPROACHED 1,439,540€, TOTALING 4,318,620€ BETWEEN 2018 AND 2020. WE FOUND THAT RECREATIONAL BLUEFIN TUNA ANGLERS HAD MEAN ANNUAL EXPENDITURES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BLUEFIN TUNA FISHING BETWEEN 7,047€ AND 2,176€ WITH AN ASSOCIATED MORTALITY IMPACT ON THE STOCK OF LESS THAN 1 TONNE ANNUALLY. BY COMPARING THE MORTALITY IMPACT TO THE EXPENDITURES, WE ESTIMATE THAT EACH DEAD ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA DURING THE THREE STUDY YEARS GENERATED 398,163€ IN MEAN ANNUAL EXPENDITURES, EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY 1636€ KG-1.

THE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE SECTOR OF KENYA CONTRIBUTES APPROXIMATELY 0.8% TO THE COUNTRY'S GDP. MARINE PRODUCTION IS ABOUT 9 000 TONNES PER YEAR. MARINE FINFISH FORM THE BULK OF THE MARINE PRODUCTION, WHILE SHELLFISH (E.G. PRAWNS, LOBSTERS AND CRABS), MOLLUSCS (E.G. OCTOPI AND SQUIDS) ARE UNDEREXPLOITED. THE FISHERY SECTOR HAS THE POTENTIAL OF ABOUT USD 5 BILLION FOR THE BLUE ECONOMY IN KENYA. CRAB FISHERY IN KENYA IS ACTIVE IN SOME AREAS OF THE SOUTH AND NORTH COAST. THE CRAB RESOURCES ALONG THE KENYAN WATERS ARE DIVERSE AND A VARIETY OF SPECIES ARE EDIBLE. THE MOST COMMONLY FISHED CRAB BY ARTISANAL FISHERS IS THE MANGROVE MUD CRAB SCYLLA SERRATA. SEMI-COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FISHERS USUALLY HAVE PORTUNID AND OTHER DEEP SEA CRABS AS BY-CATCH IN TRAWL AND LONGLINE FISHERIES, WHICH IN MANY CASES ARE UNUTILIZED. EXPORTS OF LIVE CRABS HAVE INCREASED OVER THE YEARS, WITH EXPORTS MAINLY TO ASIAN COUNTRIES. EXPORT OF FROZEN CRABS STARTED RECENTLY.

EXISTING HOSPITALITY ESTABLISHMENTS PROMOTE SPORT FISHING WITH ANGLING AS THE MAIN FORM OF RECREATIONAL FISHING. DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ACCRUED BENEFITS OF ECO-TOURISM AND COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT BY PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF INCOME FROM THE ALREADY STRANGLED COMMERCIAL AND SUBSISTENCE FISHERIES CALLING FOR DIVERSIFICATION WITHIN THE FISHING INDUSTRY. KEY INFORMANT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED TO COUNTY TOURISM AND FISHERIES REPRESENTATIVES, HOTEL DIRECTORS OR MANAGERS, AND OFFICIALS OF BEACH MANAGEMENT UNITS WHILE QUESTIONNAIRE-LED-INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED AT THE BEACHES OR COMMUNITY RECREATION SITES. SEVEN TOURIST RESORTS, ONE YACHT CLUB, AND SEVEN BEACHES/FISH LANDING SITES WERE ASSESSED. THE STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE CURRENT STATUS OF RECREATIONAL FISHING AND IDENTIFY GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. RECREATIONAL FISHING WAS CONCENTRATED AROUND MFANGANO ISLAND TARGETING NILE PERCH USING ARTIFICIAL BAITFISH AS A TACKLE. ON AVERAGE, BOAT HIRE CHARGES INCLUDING FISHING TACKLE WERE USD 30 PER TRIP (< 3 HOURS) AND USD 100 PER DAY PER FISHING TRIP. ""BLUE TOURISM"" RATING WAS LOW ACROSS THE RESPONDENTS WITH THE 2007 POLITICAL UNREST SAID TO HAVE HEAVILY IMPACTED THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS TO THE REGION. WATER HYACINTH AND POOR WATER QUALITY REMAIN A KEY CHALLENGE WITHIN WINAM GULF WHILE OVERFISHING POSED A MAJOR CONCERN IN THE OPEN LAKE WITH THE NUMBER OF LONGLINE FISHERS REPORTED TO BE ON THE RISE. RESOURCE SPATIAL PLANNING SHOULD BE INSTITUTED TO CATER FOR THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS IN THE BLUE ECONOMY. THE STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE NILE PERCH SLOT SIZE IS RECOMMENDED AND COOPERATION AMONG INDUSTRY PLAYERS ON ACCESS AND USE OF THE PRODUCTS FROM RECREATIONAL FISHING. A NATIONAL CENSUS SURVEY ON RECREATIONAL CATCHES SHOULD BE CONDUCTED IF ITS FULL POTENTIAL IS TO BE REALIZED IN PROMOTING BLUE GROWTH. © 2023 TAYLOR AND FRANCIS INC.. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",AEHMF,"H.

THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 2020 USING AN ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY FOLLOWING AN ANALYTICAL METHOD BASED ON PRINCIPLES, CRITERIA AND INDICATORS. RESPONDENTS RATED THE QUALITY OF THESE INITIATIVES ON A LIKERT SCALE (1-5) BASED ON 11 INDICATORS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SUSTAINABLE OCEAN INITIATIVE RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SCORE, WHILE MARINE PERMACULTURE SCORED THE LOWEST. BLUE ECONOMY INITIATIVES WERE CONSIDERED INCLUSIVE BY RESPONDENTS; HOWEVER, RESOURCES AND CAPACITY WERE DEEMED INSUFFICIENT. RESPONDENTS FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH (DEVELOPING COUNTRIES) RATED THE INITIATIVES HIGHER THAN THOSE FROM THE GLOBAL NORTH (DEVELOPED COUNTRIES) PERHAPS BECAUSE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE THE PRIME BENEFICIARIES OF THESE PROGRAMMES AND RECEIVE MORE FUNDING AND ASSISTANCE. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT POLICY AND DECISION-MAKERS FORMULATING POLICIES BASED ON STAKEHOLDERS' OPINIONS AND FOCUSSING ON LOW-SCORING INITIATIVES. THE BLUE ECONOMY IS A GROWING SECTOR WITH HIGH POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; HOWEVER, VARIOUS FACTORS, NOTABLY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ARE OBSTRUCTING ITS ADVANCEMENT. THEREFORE, EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS AND SUBSTANTIAL AND SUSTAINABLE FINANCE ARE VITAL FOR ENSURING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY IN BOTH THE GLOBAL NORTH AND THE GLOBAL SOUTH. © 2022 WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH, BERLIN/BOSTON.",NA,NA,NA,978-311073348-8; 978-311073829-2,NA,DE GRUYTER HANDBOOK OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCE,ENGLISH,0,NA,567 – 597,NA,FINAL,DE GRUYTER,SCOPUS,EVALUATING THE GOVERNANCE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: THE QUALITY AND LEGITIMACY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY,BOOK CHAPTER,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140810832&doi=10.1515%2f9783110733488-025&partnerID=40&md5=b60ea467add1057ddac64bd4bfd09dd7,NA,2022,DE GRUYTER HANDB OF SUSTAIN DEV AND FINANC,none,GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY;KATHMANDU FORESTRY COLLEGE;GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY;KATHMANDU FORESTRY COLLEGE;GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY,NA,"MARASENI T, 2022, DE GRUYTER HANDB OF SUSTAIN DEV AND FINANC","MARASENI T, 2022, DE GRUYTER HANDB OF SUSTAIN DEV AND FINANC"

FUNDING SOLUTIONS IN CARBON MARKETS AND PUBLIC GOODS OFTEN REQUIRES NON-TRADITIONAL FINANCE APPROACHES. THE CLIMATE FOUNDATION HAS LEVERAGED NON-PROFIT FINANCE OVER THE PAST DECADE TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF MARINE PERMACULTURE DESIGN PRINCIPLES, A BOLD AND VISIONARY EMERGING FIELD THAT CAN TRANSFORM HUMANITY'S MARINE RELATIONSHIPS FROM EXTRACTION TO REGENERATION AND HELP ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE, THE REGENERATIVE BLUE ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.

OF SUSTAIN. DEV. AND FINANC.,"SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, FINANCE AND RELATED GLOBAL POLICIES AND MECHANISMS HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE DECADES. TODAY, REGIONAL INITIATIVES FOR CLASSIFYING SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES EXIST, AND SEVERAL DECADES' RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND NATURAL CAPITAL HAVE IDENTIFIED AND TESTED ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC MODELS. THE WORLD BANK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FINANCE THEM AND SUSTAINABILITY AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE IS ACHIEVABLE. BUT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES CAN COME INTO CONFLICT. IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES EXIST IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES SUCH AS COASTAL AND MARINE TOURISM. FINANCING SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGH SOUND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL, AS IS THE USE OF PUBLIC FISCAL INSTRUMENTS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. DESPITE ITS DEVELOPED STATUS, RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICIES IN THE EU ARE LEADING TO FOREST DESTRUCTION. FINANCIAL VEHICLES SUCH AS GREEN BONDS HAVE A SIMILAR POTENTIAL. TO AVOID GREENWASHING, MORE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE AT THE BASE OF THE ECONOMIC PYRAMID, RESOURCING THEM WITH SMART TECHNOLOGIES AND VALUING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. CLIMATE FINANCE MUST BE ETHICAL AND ITS ALLOCATION HAVE INTEGRITY; THIS WILL FOSTER COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. TO AVOID REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF TERRESTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, THE WORLD'S OCEANS NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND NEW BUSINESS MODELS ADOPTED IN THIS EXPANDING FRONTIER.

CHEM.,"THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE PROJECTED RISE IN WORLD POPULATION CALL FOR A GREATLY INCREASED SUPPLY OF MATERIALS CRITICAL FOR IMPLEMENTING CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS RARE EARTH ELEMENTS (REES) AND OTHER RARE METALS. BECAUSE THE DEMAND FOR CRITICAL METALS IS INCREASING AND LAND-BASED MINERAL DEPOSITS ARE BEING DEPLETED, SEAFLOOR RESOURCES ARE SEEN AS THE NEXT FRONTIER FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION. MARINE MINERAL DEPOSITS WITH A GREAT RESOURCE POTENTIAL FOR TRANSITION, RARE, AND CRITICAL METALS INCLUDE MAINLY DEEP-SEA MINERAL DEPOSITS, SUCH AS POLYMETALLIC SULFIDES, POLYMETALLIC NODULES, COBALT-RICH CRUSTS, PHOSPHORITES, AND RARE EARTH ELEMENT-RICH MUDS. MAJOR AREAS WITH ECONOMIC INTEREST FOR SEABED MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING ARE THE FOLLOWING: NODULES IN THE PENRHYN BASIN-COOK ISLANDS EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE (EEZ), THE CLARION-CLIPPERTON NODULE ZONE, PERU BASIN NODULES, AND THE CENTRAL INDIAN OCEAN BASIN; SEAFLOOR MASSIVE SULFIDE DEPOSITS IN THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA, JAPAN, AND NEW ZEALAND AS WELL AS THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE AND THE THREE INDIAN OCEAN SPREADING RIDGES; COBALT-RICH CRUSTS IN THE PACIFIC PRIME CRUST ZONE AND THE CANARY ISLANDS SEAMOUNTS AND THE RIO GRANDE RISE IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN; AND THE RARE EARTH ELEMENT-RICH DEEP-SEA MUDS AROUND MINAMITORISHIMA ISLAND IN THE EQUATORIAL NORTH PACIFIC. IN ADDITION, ZONES FOR MARINE PHOSPHORITES EXPLORATION ARE LOCATED IN CHATHAM RISE, OFFSHORE BAJA CALIFORNIA, AND ON THE SHELF OFF NAMIBIA. MOREOVER, SHALLOW-WATER RESOURCES, LIKE PLACER DEPOSITS, REPRESENT ANOTHER MARINE SOURCE FOR MANY CRITICAL MINERALS, METALS, AND GEMS. THE MAIN CONCERNS OF DEEP-SEA MINING ARE RELATED TO ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF RARE EARTH ELEMENT MINING ON DEEP-SEA ECOSYSTEMS ARE STILL POORLY EVALUATED. FURTHERMORE, MARINE MINING MAY CAUSE CONFLICTS WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS FISHERIES, COMMUNICATIONS CABLE OWNERS, OFFSHORE WIND FARMS, AND TOURISM. THE GLOBAL OCEAN IS AN IMMENSE SOURCE OF FOOD, ENERGY, RAW MATERIALS, CLEAN WATER, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND SUFFERS SERIOUSLY BY MULTIPLE STRESSORS FROM ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY NEEDS A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. BY PROTECTING VULNERABLE AREAS, APPLYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR DEEP-SEA MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING, MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING, AND A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR MINERALS EXTRACTION, WE MAY ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT AND USE OF OUR OCEANS. © 2022 IUPAC & DE GRUYTER.

THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CRISIS ON THE STATE AND PROSPECTS OF THE EU'S MARITIME ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. THE AFFECTED MARITIME SECTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT AS A NEW ENVIRONMENTALLY-ORIENTED FORMAT OF THE MARITIME ECONOMY. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THIS INCLUDED COASTAL TOURISM, FISHERIES, AQUACULTURE, PORT ACTIVITIES, AND MARITIME TRANSPORT. SEVERAL SECTORS, INCLUDING COASTAL TOURISM AND AQUACULTURE, ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LONG-TERM BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE EU'S BLUE ECONOMY IN UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS. SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS IN THE MARITIME SECTOR AND CAUSE ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC THREATS. MEANWHILE, THE EUROPEAN UNION PLANS TO SOLVE A WIDE RANGE OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW APPROACHES TO MARITIME MANAGEMENT. THIS IDEA DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MARITIME ECONOMY AND THE BLUE ECONOMY FOR THE EU, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR THE RESTORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF MARITIME ACTIVITIES. FIRST OF ALL, THIS CONCERNS THE ALLOCATION OF TARGETED ASSISTANCE TO THE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING FOOD SECURITY.

IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE HIGH-QUALITY DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE ECONOMY TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENT-BASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ESTIMATE THE BIASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS AND ITS INFLUENCING FACTORS OF CHINA’S MARINE ECONOMY FROM 2002 TO 2016. WE USED A DEA-MALMQUIST MODEL TO MEASURE THE BIASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. THEN WE FURTHER ANALYZED INFLUENCING FACTORS OF BIASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. OUR RESEARCH FOUND THAT THE TFP OF THE MARINE ECONOMY WAS BASICALLY GROWING, AND THIS GROWTH WAS MAINLY DUE TO A POSITIVE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. IN GENERAL, THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS OF MARINE ECONOMY IS GRADUALLY BIASED TOWARDS ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EMISSIONS REDUCTION. FURTHERMORE, TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IN THE YANGTZE RIVER DELTA ARE MORE CONDUCIVE TO ENERGY CONSERVATION. THE MARINE ECONOMIC PRODUCTION IN THE PAN-PEARL RIVER DELTA IS MORE INCLINED TO PROMOTE PRODUCTION GROWTH, WHILE TIT IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE BOHAI RIM REGION. IN ADDITION, FACTORS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION, ECONOMIC LEVEL, FDI AND INDUSTRIAL SCALE HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON BIASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS OF MARINE ECONOMY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DIRECTIVE REGULATIONS HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE INPUT-BIASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS, WHILE THE INCENTIVE REGULATIONS HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE OUTPUT-BIASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY HAS IMPORTANT GUIDING SIGNIFICANCE FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EMISSION REDUCTION OF MARINE ECONOMY IN CHINA.

RES.,"HOW SHOULD ONE ASSESS WHETHER TRADITIONAL OCEAN INDUSTRIES AND NEW OCEAN EMERGING ACTIVITIES HAVE THE RIGHT INCENTIVES TO ENGAGE INTO A BLUE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY PATH? THE CASE OF BRAZIL’S PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW (PER) OF TAX EXEMPTION AND SUBSIDIES APPLIED TO OCEAN RELATED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES FROM 2011 TO 2018 OPENS THE DEBATE. THE EXTRA-BUDGETARY PER IS APPLIED WITH THE RIO MARKERS FROM ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD), THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES LISTED BY THE WORLD BANK´S BLUE ECONOMY, OCEAN DECADE’S RESULTS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 14 TARGETS. THE DATA ON TAX EXEMPTION AND SUBSIDIES WAS OBTAINED FROM OFFICIAL SOURCES, FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUDGET SYSTEM MAINTAINED BY THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY. THE SCREENING WAS CARRIED OUT FOR ALL NATIONAL LEVEL TAX RELIEF AND SUBSIDIES APPLIED DURING 2011 AND 2018. THERE WERE 316.4 BILLION REAIS (US$ 80.2 BILLION) SPENT BY BRAZIL’S FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON OCEAN-RELATED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THROUGH SUBSIDIES AND TAX RELIEF OVER 2011-2018. THE ACCUMULATED GDP OVER THAT PERIOD WAS EQUIVALENT TO 45.9 BILLION REAIS (US$ 11.6 BILLION). THE SECTOR THAT MOST BENEFITTED IS AGRICULTURE (INCLUDES FISHING), WHICH RECEIVED AROUND 229.1 BILLION REAIS (US$ 58.0 BILLION) IN INCENTIVES DURING THIS PERIOD. AS FOR THE METHOD, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND ESTABLISH STANDARDIZED OCEAN RELATED MARKERS IN THE ECONOMY AND IN PER REVIEWS. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.",NA,"K.

RES.,"THE GROWING RELEVANCE OF THE SEAS AND THE OCEAN IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL AND GOVERNANCE IS REFLECTED IN THE INCREASE AND DIVERSIFICATION OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS ON THE SUBJECT, AS WELL AS IN THE GLOBAL AGENDA. WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) SCOPE, THE 2030 AGENDA (2016-2030), ITS 17 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS), AND THE RECENT DECADE OF OCEAN SCIENCE FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (2021-2030) HIGHLIGHT THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT IN FAVOR OF KNOWLEDGE, PRESERVATION, AND SUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF THESE RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THERE IS A VAST AND RECENT ECONOMIC LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT, WHICH IS CONFUSED AND OFTEN CONTRADICTORY, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE INTERNATIONAL DEBATE AND POLICYMAKING. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DOT THE I’S AND CROSS THE T’S ON THIS LITERATURE, WHICH FREQUENTLY USES A WIDE NUANCE OF TERMS AS SYNONYMS, SUCH AS BLUE ECONOMY, MARINE ECONOMY, MARITIME ECONOMICS, OCEAN ECONOMY, ECONOMY OF THE SEA, BLUE GROWTH, COASTAL ECONOMY, AND MARITIME CLUSTER. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE “FIFTY SHADES OF BLUE” ECONOMY CONCEPTS, SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE RELEVANCE OF THE TOPIC IN THE DECADE OF OCEAN SCIENCE, WHICH OFTEN SEEMS LIMITED AND MISUNDERSTOOD. TO THIS END, THE ARTICLE PERFORMS A BIBLIOMETRIC APPROACH BASED ON 1,351 PUBLICATIONS FROM SCOPUS AND WOS DATABASES, COVERING THE 1959-2020 PERIOD, FOLLOWED BY A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. WE USE THE BIBLIOMETRIX PACKAGE IN RSTUDIO (V. 3.6.3) TO INVESTIGATE METADATA AND BIBLIOSHINY AS A TOOL FOR DATA ANALYSIS. AMONG OUR MAIN RESULTS, STAND OUT: (I) THE PROGRESS OF THE DISCUSSION OVER TIME; (II) THE EXPANSION OF THE THEMES AND ACTORS INVOLVED IN THIS AGENDA; AND (III) THE MAIN ISSUES AND TREND TOPICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS. SINCE 2012, BLUE ECONOMY HAS BEEN THE MOST USED CONCEPT DUE TO THE RIO+20 UN CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, UNDERSTANDING THE RELEVANCE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY IS AN URGENT STEP TO PROMOTE ANTI-CYCLICAL ECONOMIC POLICIES AND TO ADDRESS THE UN OCEAN DECADE, PARTICULARLY IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.",NA,NA,NA,NA,26752824,OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH,ENGLISH,0,NA,NA,NA,FINAL,UNIV SAOPAULO,SCOPUS,DOTTING THE I’S AND CROSSING THE T’S ON THE FIFTY SHADES OF BLUE ECONOMY: AN URGENT STEP TO ADDRESS THE UN OCEAN DECADE,ARTICLE,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133679029&doi=10.1590%2f2675-2824069.21017TS&partnerID=40&md5=15d0657056c258d8afe81e0e675af909,69,2021,OCEAN COAST RES,none,NA,NOTREPORTED,NA,"SANTOS T, 2021, OCEAN COAST RES","SANTOS T, 2021, OCEAN COAST RES"

RES.,"THIS PAPER PRESENTS MAJOR GAPS AND CHALLENGES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE UN DECADE OF OCEAN SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (2021-2030) IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION. THE AUTHORS MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE NEEDS AND CO-DESIGN ACTIONS IDENTIFIED DURING TWO CONSULTATIONS, PART OF THE DECADE PREPARATORY-PHASE, FRAMING THEM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA’S UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES. ACCORDING TO THE ‘MEDITERRANEAN STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2020’ BY THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME MEDITERRANEAN ACTION PLAN AND DESPITE NOTABLE PROGRESS, THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION IS NOT ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE AND FULLY IMPLEMENT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF AGENDA 2030. KEY FACTORS ARE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE HUMAN-INDUCED PRESSURES THAT THREATEN THE ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES AND SERVICES IN THE GLOBAL CHANGE SCENARIO. THE BASIN, IDENTIFIED AS A CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY HOTSPOT, IS EXPOSED TO POLLUTION AND RISING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS AFFECTS MAINLY THE COASTAL ZONES, AT INCREASING RISK OF EXTREME EVENTS AND THEIR NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF UNSUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF KEY ECONOMIC ASSETS. TRANSITIONING TO A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY IS THE KEY FOR THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT’S HEALTH AND THE NOURISHMENT OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHALLENGING CONTEXT, OFFERING THE OPPORTUNITY OF ENHANCING THE KNOWLEDGE TO DEFINE SCIENCE-BASED MEASURES AS WELL AS NARROWING THE GAPS BETWEEN THE NORTHEN AND SOUTHERN SHORES, CALLS FOR A JOINT (RE)ACTION. THE PAPER REVIEWS THE STATE OF THE ART OF MEDITERRANEAN SEA SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE, SETS OF TRENDS, CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS, SPECIFIC CHALLENGES, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH DECADE’S SOCIETAL OUTCOME. IN THE CONCLUSIONS, THE PROPOSAL FOR A MEDITERRANEAN REGIONAL PROGRAMME IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE OCEAN DECADE IS ADDRESSED. THE CORE OBJECTIVE RELIES ON INTEGRATING AND IMPROVING THE EXISTING OCEAN-KNOWLEDGE, OCEAN LITERACY, AND OCEAN OBSERVING CAPACITIES BUILDING ON INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO REACH THE “MEDITERRANEAN SEA THAT WE WANT”. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.",NA,"L.

ASOC. INT. DERECHO COORD.,"THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER LIES IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHY COOPERATIVES NEED TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION ON THE TRAINING OF THEIR MEMBERS AND WORKERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS. AS THE MAIN HYPOTHESIS, WE CONSIDER THAT THERE ARE THREE REASONS THAT LEAD TO THE CONCERN OF COOPERATIVES ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND, THEREFORE, TO THE NEED OF TRAINING IN THIS ISSUE, IN COHERENCE WITH THE FIFTH COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE. IN THIS SENSE, FIRSTLY, WE WILL ADDRESS THE IMPACT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN MEANS OR ENVIRONMENTS CAN CAUSE ON THE COOPERATIVE MEMBERS AND WORKERS. IT ENTAILS THE NEED TO STUDY THE WAYS IN WHICH THE PREVENTION IS ORGANIZED AND MANAGED IN FRONT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS IN COOPERATIVES, AS WELL AS TO SEE THE PECULIARITIES OF COOPERATIVES IN THIS REGARD. SECONDLY, WE WILL STUDY THE IMPACT OF THE COOPERATIVE WORK IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THEREFORE, WE WILL ADDRESS THE WAY IN WHICH THAT IMPACT CAN BE MANAGED IN COOPERATIVES BEFORE THE MANDATE DERIVED FROM THE SEVENTH COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE. FINALLY, WE WILL DELVE INTO THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING FOR NEW MARKETS IN THE GREEN AND BLUE ECONOMY.

THIS INHERENTLY CREATES COMPLEXITY WHEN ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF ITS SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT IN ASPIRATION OF DEVELOPMENT ACHIEVEMENT. THE EFFECT OF HUMAN DEPENDENCE ON BLUE ECONOMY RESOURCES IS NOT ALWAYS MONETARY. SOME OF THE PEOPLE USE THE RESOURCES FOR ARTISANAL PURPOSES, FOR EXCHANGE AND TRADE, WHILE OTHERS UTILIZE IT FOR THE RECREATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLUE NATURAL RESOURCES. THE WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE IS A CENTRAL PILLAR OF THE BLUE ECONOMY RESULTING IN AN IMMEDIATE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SOCIOECONOMICS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY AS WELL AS HOW TO MEASURE CHANGES, OR PROGRESS, ASSOCIATED WITH IT FOR DEVELOPMENT ACHIEVEMENT. THE PLANNING ASPECT OF BLUE ECONOMY REQUIRES STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS AT LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND REGIONAL LEVELS THAT SPUR INTEGRATION ASPECTS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY INTO DEVELOPMENT ACHIEVEMENT. THE BLUE ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT ACHIEVEMENTS REQUIRE ENGAGEMENT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND ELABORATE CONSULTATIONS OF THE AFRICAN UNION MEMBER STATES AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES. THIS IS BECAUSE BLUE ECONOMY ENTAILS THE SUSTAINABLE USE AND CONSERVATION OF MARINE, INLAND, AQUATIC, AND COASTAL RESOURCES FOR FOOD SECURITY, JOB CREATION, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

IN THIS PAPER, GLOBAL BLUE ECONOMY DEFINITION, BLUE ECONOMY POTENTIALS, RESOURCES, BLUE ECONOMY IN FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE SECTOR, PRESENT SHRIMP CULTIVATION STATUS AND BLUE ECONOMY OF SHRIMP CULTIVATION FROM BANGLADESH PERSPECTIVES HAVE BEEN REVIEWED. POTENTIAL BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS IN BANGLADESH ARE MARICULTURE, DEEP SEA FISHING, BIOTECHNOLOGY, MARINE ENERGY, SUBMARINE CABLE CONNECTIONS ETC. BLUE ECONOMY RESOURCES ARE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, HUMAN RESOURCES, PORTS-HARBORS, VESSELS AND SUBMARINES, IN ADDITION TO REMOTE SENSING FACILITIES. TO EMBRACE BLUE ECONOMY, FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE SHOULD INCLUDE TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS BIG DATA ANALYSIS, MACHINE LEARNING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND PRECISION AQUACULTURE. SHRIMP CULTIVATION OCCURS IN KHULNA, CHITTAGONG, COX‟S BAZAR, BHOLA REGIONS MOSTLY BY TRADITIONAL METHOD. SHRIMP POND MANAGEMENT, CULTURE PRACTICES, HARVESTING, GRADING, PRODUCTION, SUPPLY AND FUTURE POTENTIAL HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. SHRIMP PRODUCTION IS INCREASING STEADILY. BLUE ECONOMY OF SHRIMP CULTURE INVOLVES INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SETTLE DOWN UNSUSTAINABILITY ISSUES. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK ADDRESSING MAJOR CHALLENGAES AND SUSTAINABLE INTERVENTIONS HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED.

THE RESEARCH METHOD IS QUALITATIVE-DESCRIPTIVE USED BY ANALYZING THE NEWS FROM FIVE REPUTABLE ONLINE NEWS MEDIA IN INDONESIA USING NVIVO 12 PLUS SOFTWARE AND OTHER LITERATURE RELATED TO RESEARCH PROBLEMS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INTENSITY OF REPORTING ON THE GREEN ECONOMY DISCOURSE VARIES BETWEEN EACH ONLINE NEWS MEDIA, NAMELY: LABOR ABSORPTION INDICATORS ARE MORE DOMINANT REPORTED BY TRIBUNNEWS.COM AND KOMPAS.COM, NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BY TEMPO.CO, WASTE REDUCTION BY DETIK.COM, AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION BY ANTARANEWS.COM. MEANWHILE, IN THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT, THE MOST DOMINANT INDICATORS REPORTED ARE INDICATORS OF EFFICIENCY IN USING NATURAL RESOURCES BY TEMPO.CO AND KOMPAS.COM, POVERTY ALLEVIATION BY DETIK.COM AND ANTARANEWS.COM, AND WASTE-FREE INDICATORS BY TRIBUNNEWS.COM. FURTHERMORE, WORD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS ON THE GREEN ECONOMY CONCEPT SHOWS THAT THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED TOPICS ARE ABOUT THE USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, WHILE IN THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT, THE MOST FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED TOPICS ARE ABOUT FISH FARMING FOR SUSTAINABLE FOOD AND THE CLEANLINESS OF THE OCEANS FROM WASTE. COMPARED TO THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT, THE GREEN ECONOMY CONCEPT HAS BEEN REPORTED MORE BY THE MEDIA. HOWEVER, THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT IS A BIT MORE FAVORED BECAUSE IT IS CHEAPER AND MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY/WASTE-FREE.

THE DEMAND FOR OCEAN DATA TO INFORM SCIENTIFIC, RISK REDUCTION, AND NATIONAL SECURITY NEEDS IS LEADING TO A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DEPLOYED OCEAN OBSERVATION AND MONITORING SYSTEMS, MOST OF WHICH REQUIRE INCREASED POWER. BECAUSE OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN PLACED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS, THEY PRIMARILY RELY ON ENERGY STORAGE (OR IN SOME CASES IN SITU ENERGY GENERATION) TO POWER INSTRUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH IMPOSES LIMITS ON SAMPLING RATES, DEPLOYMENT TIMES, AND SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOLUTION OF DATA.

A NOVEL APPROACH THAT IS BEING APPLIED WITHIN THIS NEW CONSERVATION FINANCE FRONTIER IS THE INTEGRATION OF ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION AND INSURANCE. BY SYNTHESIZING RECENT LITERATURES IN POLITICAL ECOLOGY ON THE NOTION OF RENT AND THE BIOPOLITICS OF NATURE, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE INTEGRATION OF ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION AND INSURANCE CAN BE SEEN AS A TECHNIQUE THAT IS MOBILIZED FOR GOVERNING ECOSYSTEM RENTS BIOPOLITICALLY. THE ARTICLE URGES POLITICAL ECOLOGISTS TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW BIOPOLITICS AND GOVERNANCE OF RENTS INTERSECT IN MARKET-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE.WHILE SURVEYING THE BREADTH OF PROJECTS THAT INVOLVES BOTH ADAPTATION AND INSURANCE, I PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO A PARAMETRIC CORAL REEF INSURANCE THAT WAS RECENTLY INTRODUCED IN THE MEXICAN STATE QUINTANA ROO. SUCH A PROJECT, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, INVOLVES RECONCEPTUALIZING THE CORAL REEF AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS – ULTIMATELY RENTS – TO THE LOCAL TOURIST INDUSTRY AND INDIRECTLY THE STATE, BUT THIS CORAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS ITSELF IN NEED OF BEING PROTECTED THROUGH INSURANCE AS A BIOPOLITICAL MEASURE THAT CAN ENSURE THE FUTURE LIFE OF THE CORAL REEF BY RENDERING CALCULABLE UNCERTAIN, FUTURE CLIMATE THREATS TO THE REEF. BY RECONCEPTUALIZING ECOSYSTEMS AS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BE INSURED, THE NOTION OF ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION OPERATIONALIZES OTHERWISE SYSTEMATIC RISKS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS ON A LOCAL SCALE.

THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROCESSES TAKING PLACE IN THE WHITE SEA COASTAL MUNICIPALITIES. THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE WHITE SEA COASTAL MUNICIPAL AREAS IN THE CONTEXT OF BLUE GROWTH AND TO ELABORATE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FORMATION AN INCLUSIVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THE STATISTICAL DATA PUBLISHED BY THE FEDERAL STATE STATISTIC SERVICE (ROSSTAT) AND REFLECTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF MUNICIPALITIES IN THE THREE INTERRELATED AREAS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ARE ANALYZED. THE DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES OCCURRING IN THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL SPHERE OF COASTAL TERRITORIES ARE REVELED AND DESCRIBED: DEPOPULATION, DECREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD. MODELS ARE DEVELOPED THAT REFLECT MIGRATION PROCESSES TAKING PLACE IN COASTAL MUNICIPAL FORMATIONS WITHIN THE PERIOD 1989—2017. THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF COASTAL MUNICIPAL FORMATIONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES. IN SOME MUNICIPAL DISTRICTS, THE MAIN TYPES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ARE THOSE RELATED TO THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE POPULATION. THERE IS A DECREASE IN QUALITY OF ECONOMIC SPACE DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF WORKING-AGE PEOPLE. THE DIGITAL SPACE OF COASTAL SETTLEMENTS IS FORMING SLOWLY. AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF DESTRUCTIVE PROCESSES IN ECONOMIC SPHERE, THE ECO-INTENSITY OF EMISSIONS DECREASES. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ON SHAPING OF A REGULAR INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND OVERCOMING DEPOPULATION PROCESSES, AND SUGGEST DIRECTIONS FOR THE ECONOMY DIVERSIFICATION OF COASTAL TERRITORIES. THE AUTHORS CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN INTER-MUNICIPAL COOPERATION AND COORDINATION OF MANAGEMENT DECISIONS FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE WHITE SEA REGION.

GENET.,"A KEY COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY IS THE SUSTAINABLE EXTRACTION OF MARINE RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH NETWORKS OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS). CONNECTIVITY AND REPRESENTATIVITY ARE ESSENTIAL FACTORS THAT UNDERLIE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF MPA NETWORKS, WHICH CAN SAFEGUARD BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, AND ULTIMATELY SUPPORT THE BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY BY BALANCING OCEAN USE WITH CONSERVATION. NEW “BIG DATA” OMICS APPROACHES, INCLUDING GENOMICS AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS, ARE BECOMING ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF MPA NETWORKS. CURRENT MOLECULAR OMICS TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING POPULATION-SCALE GENOME SEQUENCING, HAVE DIRECT APPLICATIONS FOR ASSESSING POPULATION CONNECTIVITY AND FOR EVALUATING HOW GENETIC VARIATION IS REPRESENTED WITHIN AND AMONG MPAS. EFFECTIVE BASELINE CHARACTERIZATION AND LONG-TERM, SCALABLE, AND COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL MPA MANAGEMENT, AND OMICS APPROACHES HOLD GREAT PROMISE TO CHARACTERIZE THE FULL RANGE OF MARINE LIFE, SPANNING THE MICROBIOME TO MEGAFAUNA ACROSS A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (SHALLOW SEA TO THE DEEP OCEAN). OMICS TOOLS, SUCH AS EDNA METABARCODING CAN PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS FOR BIODIVERSITY MONITORING IN LARGE AND REMOTE CONSERVATION AREAS. HERE WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT OMICS APPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING AND MONITORING, WITH A FOCUS ON METABARCODING, METAGENOMICS, AND POPULATION GENOMICS. EMERGING APPROACHES, INCLUDING WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING, CHARACTERIZATION OF GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE, EPIGENOMICS, AND GENOMIC VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ALSO REVIEWED.

THESE INITIATIVES HAVE DRAWN FROM THE SEVEN “OL PRINCIPLES” THAT WERE DEVELOPED BY THE COLLEGE OF EXPLORATION OL NETWORK IN 2005. THEY REPRESENT A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION FOR THE MANY ENDEAVORS THAT ARE AIMING TO ACHIEVE A SOCIETY THAT FULLY UNDERSTANDS THE INFLUENCE OF THEMSELVES – AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A POPULATION – ON THE OCEAN AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE OCEAN ON THEM.

THE TOTAL RECONSTRUCTED DOMESTIC CATCH WAS APPROXIMATELY 1.5 TIMES LARGER THAN THE BASELINE AS REPORTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) ON BEHALF OF SEYCHELLES FROM 1950 TO 2017 AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR FULLY DOMESTIC CATCHES WITHIN THE EEZ. DOMESTIC CATCHES (I.E., EXCLUDING THE LARGE-SCALE INDUSTRIAL PELAGIC CATCHES) INCREASED BY OVER 500% THROUGHOUT THE TIME PERIOD, GROWING FROM 1,900 T⋅YEAR−1 IN THE 1950S TO AROUND 11,200 T IN 2017. THE MAJOR TARGETED TAXA WERE JACKS (CARANGIDAE), TUNA-LIKE FISHES (SCOMBRIDAE) AND SNAPPERS (LUTJANIDAE).

WE DEFINE SUCCESS IN TERMS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY BALANCE AMONG ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS. DRAWING ON EXTENSIVE EXPERT EXPERIENCES, OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND LITERATURE REVIEW OF CASE STUDIES ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT, WE HIGHLIGHT TWO CRITICAL FINDINGS. FIRST, LARGE SCALE BE INITIATIVES PRIORITIZE ECONOMIC GAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND THE EXCLUSION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SECOND, USING THE FULL SPECTRUM SUSTAINABILITY (FSS) EVALUATION, WE SHOW THAT SUCCESSFUL BE INTERVENTIONS CONSIDERED ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIO-CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVES.

WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT THESE RESTORATION EFFORTS INTO AN ECOTOURISM APPROACH THAT EMBEDS LAND-BASED CORAL GARDENING EFFORTS AS ARCHITECTURAL LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS TO ENHANCE AND BEAUTIFY COASTAL DEVELOPMENT SITES, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL VALUE AND RATIONALE FOR ECOTOURISM STAKEHOLDERS TO INVEST. OUR APPROACH EXTENDS AND COMPLEMENTS EXISTING CONCEPTS INTEGRATING CORAL REEF RESTORATION IN ECOTOURISM PROJECTS BY CREATING A PARTICIPATORY PLATFORM THAT CAN BE EXPERIENCED BY THE PUBLIC, WHILE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING NUMEROUS RESTORATION TECHNIQUES, AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LONG-TERM RESTORATION AND MONITORING STUDIES.

COMPARISONS OF THE GLOBAL SCENARIOS, NATIONAL PROJECTIONS AND SECTORAL PROJECTIONS SUGGEST THAT THE AUSTRALIAN MARINE SECTORS EXPECT TO FOLLOW A PATH OF GROWTH MOSTLY DRIVEN BY MARKET FORCES ENABLED BY GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) DECLARED 2021–2030 AS THE UN DECADE OF OCEAN SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE ROADMAP FOR THE OCEAN DECADE AIMS TO ACHIEVE SIX CRITICAL SOCIETAL OUTCOMES (SOS) BY 2030, THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF FOUR OBJECTIVES (OS). IT SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZES THE SCARCITY OF BIOLOGICAL DATA FOR DEEP-SEA BIOMES, AND CHALLENGES THE GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF DEEP-SEA ECOSYSTEMS TO INFORM SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE MAP FOUR KEY SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY TO THE OCEAN DECADE SOS: (I) WHAT IS THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE IN THE DEEP OCEAN? (II) HOW ARE POPULATIONS AND HABITATS CONNECTED? (III) WHAT IS THE ROLE OF LIVING ORGANISMS IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION AND SERVICE PROVISION? AND (IV) HOW DO SPECIES, COMMUNITIES, AND ECOSYSTEMS RESPOND TO DISTURBANCE? WE THEN CONSIDER THE DESIGN OF A GLOBAL-SCALE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS BY REVIEWING KEY DRIVERS OF ECOLOGICAL PATTERN AND PROCESS. WE RECOMMEND USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA TO STRATIFY A GLOBAL SURVEY DESIGN: BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGION, DEPTH, HORIZONTAL DISTANCE, SUBSTRATE TYPE, HIGH AND LOW CLIMATE HAZARD, FISHED/UNFISHED, NEAR/FAR FROM SOURCES OF POLLUTION, LICENSED/PROTECTED FROM INDUSTRY ACTIVITIES. WE CONSIDER BOTH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SURVEYS, AND EMPHASIZE NEW BIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTION THAT PRIORITIZES SOUTHERN AND POLAR LATITUDES, DEEPER (> 2000 M) DEPTHS, AND MIDWATER ENVIRONMENTS. WE PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON OBSERVATIONAL, EXPERIMENTAL, AND MONITORING NEEDS FOR DIFFERENT BENTHIC AND PELAGIC ECOSYSTEMS. WE THEN REVIEW RECENT EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE BIOLOGICAL DATA AND SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND ARCHIVING, MAKING “SAMPLING DESIGN TO KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION” RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF A NEW GLOBAL PROGRAM.

MAR. SCI.,"FOR MILLENNIA, COASTAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS HAVE ADAPTED AND FLOURISHED IN THE RED SEA’S UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT. SURROUNDED BY DESERTS ON ALL SIDES, THE RED SEA IS SUBJECTED TO HIGH DUST INPUTS AND RECEIVES VERY LITTLE FRESHWATER INPUT, AND SO HARBORS A HIGH SALINITY. CORAL REEFS, SEAGRASS MEADOWS, AND MANGROVES FLOURISH IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO THE BORDERING COASTLINES AND COUNTRIES. INTERESTINGLY, WHILE CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING RAPID DECLINE ON A GLOBAL SCALE, THOSE IN THE RED SEA APPEAR TO BE IN RELATIVELY BETTER SHAPE. THAT SAID, THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT IMMUNE TO THE STRESSORS THAT CAUSE DEGRADATION, SUCH AS INCREASING OCEAN TEMPERATURE, ACIDIFICATION AND POLLUTION. IN MANY REGIONS, ECOSYSTEMS ARE ALREADY SEVERELY DETERIORATING AND ARE FURTHER THREATENED BY INCREASING POPULATION PRESSURE AND LARGE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. DEGRADATION OF THESE MARINE HABITATS WILL LEAD TO ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC LOSSES. THEREFORE, IT WILL RESULT IN A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BORDERING COUNTRIES TO DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY AND INTEGRATE INNOVATIVE NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS. RECOGNIZING THAT SECURING THE RED SEA ECOSYSTEMS’ FUTURE MUST OCCUR IN SYNERGY WITH CONTINUED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, WE DEVELOPED AN ACTION PLAN FOR THE CONSERVATION, RESTORATION, AND GROWTH OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE RED SEA. WE THEN INVESTIGATED THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES FOR FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC INVESTMENT THAT MAY INCENTIVIZE THESE ACTIVITIES. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A SET OF COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, ECOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH CAN, IF IMPLEMENTED STRATEGICALLY, HELP ENSURE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS WHILE PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION.

MAR. SCI.,"A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS (CBA) IS DESCRIBED FOR A NOVEL WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS (WEC) DESIGN BASED ON A MARINE HYBRID BIO-STRUCTURE—A COMBINATION OF MACROALGAE, SHELLFISH OR OTHER SPECIES ON A BUILT FRAME. THE BIO-OSCILLATOR DESIGN UTILISES A HARD “SKELETON” (E.G., CARBON FIBRE, WOOD) ON WHICH BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS (E.G., SHELLFISH, LARGE MACROALGAE) ARE GROWN. AS WAVES PASS BY, THE LOAD GENERATED BY THE OSCILLATING DRAG AND INERTIA IS TRANSFERRED THROUGH MOORING LINES TO POWER TAKEOFF TECHNOLOGY. THIS NOVEL APPROACH ESSENTIALLY REVERSES THE TYPICAL MARINE ENGINEERING VIEW THAT “BIO-FOULING IS BAD” AND INSTEAD LEVERAGES OFF THE ADDED-DRAG OF BIOLOGICAL GROWTH ON STRUCTURES. THE APPROACH RESULTS IN A STRUCTURE THAT IS LARGELY BIODEGRADABLE, NATURALLY SELF-REPLICATING AND SYNERGISTIC WITH THE BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT, SELF-DE-RISKING IN TERMS OF FAILURE IMPACT AND CAN LEVERAGE OFF ITS OWN FORM TO ENHANCE ENERGY CAPTURE BEYOND A CONVENTIONAL DESIGN. THIS REDUCES IMPACT WHILE CONNECTING WITH CONVENTIONAL MARINE INDUSTRIES SUCH AS AQUACULTURE. A CBA EXAMINES THE ECONOMIC PROS AND CONS OF THIS APPROACH, FOCUSING ON INSTALLATION AND MATERIAL COSTS, ALONG WITH BENEFITS FROM SYNERGISTIC PRODUCTION. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT IN ADDITION TO TYPICAL WAVE ENERGY OBSTACLES (E.G., CABLE LENGTH, CAPTURE WIDTH, AND POWER TAKE OFF) THE BENEFITS (BIODEGRADABILITY, HARVESTABILITY, AND CARBON REDUCTION) OF REPLACING MUCH OF THE MASS OF THE STRUCTURE WITH LIVING BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL CAN BE INCLUDED. © COPYRIGHT © 2021 HILDEBRAND, FISCHER, RELANO, GORMAN AND STEVENS.",NA,"C.

WE ESTIMATED THE FREQUENCY OF DIFFERENT RESEARCH CATEGORIES (I.E., THEMES, AND SPATIAL/TEMPORAL SCALES), AND TESTED THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE NUMBER OF PAPERS ACROSS THE CATEGORIES OF EACH RESEARCH ASPECT WAS EVEN IN DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER, THE FREQUENCY OF STUDIES FOCUSING ON BIODIVERSITY AT A LOCAL (≤100 KM2) SCALE (RELATIVE TO REGIONAL AND OCEANIC AND PAN-OCEANIC SCALES) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER; WHILE OTHER THEME CATEGORIES (E.G., ECO-TOXICOLOGY, CONNECTIVITY, STRUCTURAL-INTEGRITY, RESTORATION AND OTHER) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN EXPECTED. TEMPORALLY, ≤1-YEAR STUDIES WERE MORE FREQUENT THAN MULTI-YEAR STUDIES, BUT THESE FREQUENCIES DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE FROM THE ASSUMED DISTRIBUTION OF EQUAL FREQUENCIES. WE PROPOSE THAT FURTHER RESEARCH BE CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE BENEFITS OF BOTH RETENTION AND REMOVAL OF STRUCTURES. ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON DECOMMISSIONING SHOULD EXTEND ITS FOCUS BEYOND BIODIVERSITY, TO INCLUDE ECO-TOXICOLOGY, STRUCTURAL-INTEGRITY, CONNECTIVITY AT LARGER SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES.

AT THE SAME TIME, AND AS A RESULT OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, FIVE STRATEGIC SECTORS WITH GREAT GROWTH POTENTIAL WERE IDENTIFIED: AQUACULTURE, RENEWABLE ENERGIES, BLUE BIOTECHNOLOGY, DEEP SEA MINING, AND NAUTICAL TOURISM. THESE WERE THE PILLARS FOR THE BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY, LEADING TO MORE JOBS AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS TREND QUICKLY SPREAD TO OTHER CONTINENTS, UNIVERSALISING THE CONCEPT OF BLUE GROWTH. HOWEVER, THE GROWING COMPETITION FOR MARITIME SPACE, DUE TO NEW USES, LED TO THE REALISATION THAT ALONG WITH THE NEED TO ENSURE CONFIDENCE AND STABILITY FOR INVESTORS, IT WOULD BE IMPERATIVE TO DEVELOP NEW PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS FOR THESE SPACES. DURING THIS PROCESS, GOVERNMENTS QUICKLY REALISED THAT THIS EVOLUTION, WHICH HAD THE POTENTIAL FOR FAR REACHING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS, REQUIRED A NEW INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ADAPTED TO THIS NEW REALITY, WHICH WOULD END UP HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE GOVERNMENTS STRUCTURE ITSELF.

SCI.,"COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING AND MODELING SYSTEMS (COASTAL OBSERVATORIES), CONNECTED WITH REGIONAL AND GLOBAL OCEAN SYSTEMS, IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AND FORECASTS FOR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE MARITIME ACTIVITIES. THE PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF SYSTEMATIC AND LONG-TERM INFORMATION OF THE OCEAN IS AN ENGINE FOR THE BLUE ECONOMY, BOOSTING ECONOMIC GROWTH, EMPLOYMENT, AND INNOVATION. AN OVERVIEW OF SOME BRAZILIAN INITIATIVES IS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER, INVOLVING UNIVERSITIES, PRIVATE COMPANIES, FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, COVERING INSTITUTIONS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH OF BRAZIL. ALTHOUGH THESE INITIATIVES FOCUS MAINLY ON OCEAN PHYSICS, INTEGRATED EFFORTS CAN EXTEND THE SCOPE TO INCLUDE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND MARINE BIODIVERSITY, HELPING TO ADDRESS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS. EXISTING INITIATIVES CAN BE CONNECTED, AND NEW ONES FOSTERED, TO FILL IN THE GAPS OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL COVERAGE OF OCEAN MONITORING IN THE VAST OCEANIC AREA UNDER BRAZILIAN JURISDICTION (NATIONALLY REFERRED TO AS THE BLUE AMAZON, IN REFERENCE TO THE SIMILAR RICHNESS OF THE AMAZON FOREST). THE ALIGNMENT AMONG NATIONAL AND REGIONAL INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS WITH INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS, CAN BE PROMOTED IF COORDINATED BY A NATIONAL-LEVEL ORGANIZATION, MAXIMIZING THE RETURN OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS. IN LIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES, POSSIBLE FUTURE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED, LEVERAGING FROM EXISTING NATIONAL PUBLIC POLICIES AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION THAT BRAZIL IS TAKING PART.

MAR. SCI.,"THIS WORK IS THE RESULT OF AN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE MAIN IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON MARINE RECREATIONAL FISHING. CHANGES WERE ASSESSED ON (1) ACCESS TO FISHING, DERIVED FROM LOCKDOWNS AND OTHER MOBILITY RESTRICTIONS; (2) ECOSYSTEMS, BECAUSE OF ALTERATIONS IN FISHING INTENSITY AND HUMAN PRESENCE; (3) THE BLUE ECONOMY, DERIVED FROM ALTERATIONS IN THE INVESTMENTS AND EXPENSES OF THE FISHERS; AND (4) SOCIETY, IN RELATION TO VARIATIONS IN FISHERS’ HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. FOR THIS, A CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS FROM 16 COUNTRIES WAS CARRIED OUT, AS WELL AS AN INTERNATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY AIMED AT RECREATIONAL FISHERS, THAT INCLUDED SPECIFIC QUESTIONS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE FISHERS’ HETEROGENEITY IN RELATION TO BEHAVIOR, SKILLS AND KNOW-HOW, AND VITAL INVOLVEMENT. FISHERS’ PARTICIPATION IN THE ONLINE SURVEY (5,998 RECREATIONAL FISHERS IN 15 COUNTRIES) WAS PROMOTED THROUGH A MARKETING CAMPAIGN. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FISHERS’ CLUSTERING PROCEDURE, BASED ON THE CAPTURED HETEROGENEITY, WAS EVALUATED BY SIMPER ANALYSIS AND BY GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS FROM THE EXPERT CONSULTATION HIGHLIGHTED A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION IN MARINE RECREATIONAL FISHING ACTIVITY. LOWER HUMAN-DRIVEN PRESSURES ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE SOME BENEFITS FOR MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. HOWEVER, EXPERTS ALSO IDENTIFIED HIGH NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE BLUE ECONOMY, AS WELL AS ON FISHER HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF RECREATIONAL FISHING OPPORTUNITIES. MOST (98%) OF THE FISHERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ONLINE SURVEY WERE IDENTIFIED AS ADVANCED, SHOWING A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE OF COMMITMENT TO RECREATIONAL FISHING THAN BASIC FISHERS (2%). ADVANCED FISHERS WERE, IN GENERAL, MORE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19, REPORTING HIGHER REDUCTIONS IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FISH CONSUMPTION, AS WELL AS POORER QUALITY OF NIGHT REST, FOUL MOOD, AND RAISED MORE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH STATUS. CONTROLLED AND SAFE ACCESS TO MARINE RECREATIONAL FISHERIES DURING PANDEMICS WOULD PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE AND REDUCE NEGATIVE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS, ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE SOCIAL GROUPS.

MAR. SCI.,"BLUE GROWTH HAS BECOME ONE OF THE KEY TOPICS OF OCEAN MANAGEMENT. IT IS DEFINED AS A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF OCEAN-RELATED ACTIVITIES WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. CAPTURE FISHERIES ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH POTENTIAL AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION’S BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY. IN OUR REVIEW, WE, HOWEVER, ARGUE THAT CAPTURE FISHERIES SHOULD PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN NATIONAL BLUE GROWTH STRATEGIES. WE IDENTIFIED TWO INTERCONNECTED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO FOSTER BLUE GROWTH IN FISHERIES, A) THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA (CDQ) SYSTEMS AND B) THE SUPPORT OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSF). THEY HOLD THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT FISHERY-DEPENDENT COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND THEREFORE COUNTERACT CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE FISHING SECTOR. ADDITIONALLY, THEY PROVIDE THE POSSIBILITY TO IMPROVE QUOTA ACCESS FOR SMALL-SCALE FISHERMEN. BESIDES HAVING BETTER ACCESS TO QUOTA, THE FUTURE OF SSF DEPENDS ON SOURCES OF PUBLIC FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENT AND INNOVATION AS WELL AS INCREASED REPRESENTATION IN THE MANAGEMENT. IN THIS PERSPECTIVE, WE PRESENT DIFFERENT CASES THAT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED CDQS (THE ALASKA POLLOCK FISHERY) OR HAVE CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO IMPLEMENT CDQ PROGRAMS OR IMPROVE THEIR CURRENT APPROACHES (UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, AND ICELAND). WE FURTHER DISCUSS EXAMPLES FOR SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT SSF DIRECTLY. IF THESE ASPECTS ARE CONSIDERED IN A BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY, THE SURVIVAL OF FISHERY-DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES COULD BE ASSURED, AND SSF COULD DEVELOP FROM PREDOMINANTLY PART-TIME OR SUBSISTENCE FISHERIES TO A FULL-TIME OCCUPATION. BY THOSE MEANS, THEY WOULD BE PART OF A FOSTERING BLUE ECONOMY AND STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE FISHING PRACTICES IN EUROPE.

THE GOAL OF BIO-GO-SHIP IS TO PRODUCE SYSTEMATIC AND CONSISTENT BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS DURING GLOBAL OCEAN REPEAT HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE PLANKTONIC ECOSYSTEM. OCEAN PLANKTON ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE EARTH CLIMATE SYSTEM, FORM THE BASE OF THE OCEANIC FOOD WEB AND THEREBY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INFLUENCING FOOD SECURITY AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE BLUE ECONOMY. DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE, OCEAN BIOLOGY IS LARGELY UNDER-SAMPLED IN TIME AND SPACE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES. THIS LACK OF INFORMATION HAMPERS OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF PLANKTON IN REGULATING BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND FUELING HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS, NOW AND IN FUTURE OCEAN CONDITIONS. TRADITIONALLY, MANY OF THE METHODS USED TO QUANTIFY BIOLOGICAL AND ECOSYSTEM ESSENTIAL OCEAN VARIABLES (EOVS), MEASURES THAT PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ON THE ECOSYSTEM, HAVE BEEN EXPENSIVE AND LABOR- AND TIME-INTENSIVE, LIMITING THEIR LARGE-SCALE DEPLOYMENT. IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND MATURED, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO GREATLY EXPAND OUR BIOLOGICAL OCEAN OBSERVING CAPACITY. THESE TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING CELL IMAGING, BIO-OPTICAL SENSORS AND 'OMIC TOOLS, CAN BE COMBINED TO PROVIDE OVERLAPPING MEASUREMENTS OF KEY BIOLOGICAL AND ECOSYSTEM EOVS. NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DATA MANAGEMENT AND OPEN SHARING CAN FACILITATE MEANINGFUL SYNTHESIS AND INTEGRATION WITH CONCURRENT PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA.

MOREOVER, THEY FREQUENTLY TRIGGER CONFLICTS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES, BY IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS TO THEIR ACTIVITIES WITH NO ALTERNATIVE OR COMPENSATIONS, CAUSING SERIOUS GOVERNANCE INEFFICIENCIES. THUS, WITHIN THE UN OCEANS DECADE, MPA’S MUST FACE SIMULTANEOUSLY THREE OF THE CHALLENGES: PROTECT AND RESTORE ECOSYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY (CHALLENGE 2); DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE OCEAN ECONOMY (CHALLENGE 4) AND CHANGE HUMANITY’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OCEAN (CHALLENGE 10). TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT MANAGEMENT MODELS OF MPA’S HAD TO FIND WAYS TO VALUE NATURAL CAPITAL AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INVOLVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE GOVERNANCE PROCESSES. THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY HAS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR MANY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, NAMELY TOURISM, BEING ECOTOURISM CONSIDERED ONE OF THE SEGMENTS PARTICULARLY ADEQUATE TO VALUE NATURAL CAPITAL. ECOTOURISM, DEFINED AS “ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL AND VISITATION TO RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED NATURAL AREAS”, TO ENJOY AND APPRECIATE NATURE, IS OFTEN USED TO ENHANCE THE NATURAL CAPITAL, WHILE PROTECTING AND PROMOTING PROTECTED AREAS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT ABOUT ECOTOURISM IN MPA’S ALL OVER THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ANALYZED SEVERAL CASE STUDIES FOCUSING ECOTOURISM IN MPAS, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INDUSTRY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY, AND THE EFFORTS FOR OCEAN CONSERVATION. FROM THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED, WE CONCLUDE THAT ECOTOURISM DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN MPAS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL ROOM TO NEW ADVANCES IMPROVING GOOD MARINE GOVERNANCE.

SCI.,"ISLAND GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE DECENT WORK AND SOCIAL PROTECTION THEIR HIGHEST POLICY PRIORITY, AIMING TO LINK THEM TO THE SO-CALLED BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS SUCH AS FISHERIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL-SCALE COMMERCIAL FISHING IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TRANSNATIONAL FISHERIES TRADE AND DEPENDS ON DIVE FISHER LABOUR FORCE FACING ISSUES WITH DEFICITS IN DECENT WORK, HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND SAFETY AT SEA PROVISIONS. GIVEN THE MACRO-POLICY PRIORITIES FOR DECENT WORK IN THE TRANSITION OF SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES (SIDS) TO BLUE ECONOMY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS IN SMALL-SCALE COMMERCIAL FISHERIES TRADE THAT HAVE EXACERBATED UNSAFE MARINE WORKING CONDITIONS OF DIVE FISHERS. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL FISHERIES TRADE, THE MISMATCH BETWEEN MACRO-LEVEL DECISIONS AND MICRO-LEVEL LABOUR NEEDS HAS HARDLY BEEN EXPLORED VIA THE BLUE ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL INTERLINKAGES. THIS STUDY USED A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS OF DIVE FISHERS AND EXAMINED WHY DIVE-RELATED ACCIDENTS AND FATALITIES OCCUR IN COMMERCIAL FISHERIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IN THE ANALYSIS OF DIVING ACCIDENTS HELPS THE STUDY TO, FIRSTLY, HIGHLIGHT THE GAPS BETWEEN MACRO POLICY AND PRACTICE AT THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS. SECONDLY, THE APPROACH HELPS EXPLORE THE NEED FOR A COHERENT APPROACH TO POLICY INTEGRATION THAT BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN THE MACRO AND OPERATIONAL LEVELS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES LABOUR FORCE. THE STUDY ANALYSES THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION’S DECENT WORK INSTRUMENTS WITH SIDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES FOR FISHERIES WORKFORCE AND POINTS OUT THAT GOVERNMENTS MUST BE RESPONSIBLE AT THE MACRO LEVEL FOR MANAGING ACCIDENTS AT SEA AND BUILDING A SAFE DIVING WORKFORCE THROUGH COMPETENT MARINE AND DIVING AUTHORITIES.

URBANISED AREAS HAVE BEEN ALTERNATELY CHARACTERISED IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AS DEGRADED, DEPAUPERATE, OR IN SOME CASES DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT. TO ADVANCE OUR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNITY OF MOBILE MARINE FAUNA IN THESE AREAS, WE USED REPEATED SONAR IMAGE SAMPLING OVER LARGE SWATHES OF TWO URBAN-INDUSTRIAL SEASCAPES, COMBINED WITH UNDERWATER VIDEO. 2,341 SONAR SEGMENTS WERE CAPTURED ACROSS MACKAY HARBOUR AND THE PIONEER RIVER ESTUARY (NORTH QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA).

CHINA, JAPAN, AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA (ROK)ARE NOW AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE TO THEIR SURROUNDING WATERS AND THEIR COUNTRY’S DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER,THE POOR IMPLEMENTATION OF MARINE GOVERNANCE GIVES RISE TO THE UNSATISFACTORY EFFECT OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE GOVERNANCE IN THE SEA AREA. BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF BLUE ECONOMY AND THE DATA OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN THE YELLOW SEA AND EAST CHINA SEA, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING BINDING LEGAL NORMS AND POLICIES TO PROMOTE THE PROGRESS OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE TREATMENT IN CHINA, JAPAN AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA. BY USING RESEARCH METHODS OF TEXT ANALYSIS AND STATUS SURVEY, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE DIFFERENCES AND COMMON DEMANDS OF CHINA, JAPAN AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION CONTROL. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THREE COUNTRIES HAVE COMMON DEMANDS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE OF MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FLEXIBLE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS. FINALLY, THROUGH THE CASE EXPERIENCE OF THE BLUE CYCLE MODEL OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE IN TAIZHOU, ZHEJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THAT THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BE USED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE IN CHINA, JAPAN AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA.

A PROGRESSIVE NATIONAL STANCE TOWARDS OCEAN SUSTAINABILITY AND AN EMERGING ECONOMY PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY TOURISTS ARE TWO OF SEVERAL FACTORS THAT MAKE SEYCHELLES A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD LABELLING AND CONSUMPTION PROGRAMME, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR FISHERY HARVESTERS, REGULATORS, BUYERS AND CONSUMERS TO IMPROVE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. TO ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF SUCH A PROGRAMME, WE CONDUCTED A PILOT STUDY, SURVEYING 33 ARTISANAL FISHERS AND MAPPING SUPPLY CHAIN STRUCTURE TO EXAMINE INCENTIVES AND CHALLENGES. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED FISHERS’ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, RELIANCE ON FISHING FOR INCOME, AND FLEXIBILITY IN GEAR TYPE AND SPECIES TARGETED.

MAR. SCI.,"RECENTLY, THE RIGHTS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERS HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN OCEAN GOVERNANCE BECAUSE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT AND VARIOUS MARITIME ACTIVITIES HAVE REDUCED TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUNDS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSF) ARE INCREASINGLY BEING THREATENED BY OCEAN GRABBING, POLLUTION, AND A LACK OF INCLUSIVENESS IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE GUIDELINES TO RESOLVE AND REDUCE CONFLICT, FORMAL AVENUES TO INCLUDE FISHER CONCERNS, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF OCEAN DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE, REMAIN A DIFFICULT TASK. MOREOVER, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON HOW FISHERS ARE IMPACTED BY COASTAL AND MARINE DEVELOPMENT AND HOW THEIR CONCERNS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. HENCE, THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SSF DISCOURSE BY UNDERSTANDING AND DESCRIBING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND CONCERNS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERS FROM TWO COASTAL TOWNS IN EAST AFRICA WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PORT DEVELOPMENT. USING DATA FROM PERCEPTION SURVEYS, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, AND PARTICIPATORY MAPPING, WE DISCUSS HOW FISHERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES TO DEVELOP PORTS IN LAMU, KENYA, AND BAGAMOYO, TANZANIA. WE FOUND THAT FISHERS RELY ON NEARSHORE ECOSYSTEMS SUCH AS MANGROVES AND CORAL REEFS BECAUSE OF THEIR ACCESSIBILITY SINCE MOST FISHERS ONLY USE LOW-POWERED BOATS FOR FISHING. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT THE FISHERS’ LIVELIHOODS WERE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY PORT DEVELOPMENT AND THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS CONCERNING THE PORT’S CONSTRUCTION AND FISHERS’ COMPENSATIONS. WHILE SOME FISHERS BELIEVE THAT NEW PORTS IN THE REGION CAN INCREASE THEIR LIVELIHOODS BY CREATING NEW MARKETS AND JOBS, THIS IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN SINCE MOST FISHERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO WORK IN FORMAL PORT-RELATED JOBS. WE PROPOSE THREE STEPS THAT WILL ALLOW FISHERMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN PORT DEVELOPMENT DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUSTAINABLE SSF. THESE INCLUDE IMPROVING ENGAGEMENT WITH FISHERS TO ALLOW MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING, DEVELOPING A BLUE ECONOMY POLICY FOCUSED ON SSF, AND IMPLEMENTING MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING.

CHARTER BOAT FISHING HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED IN TEMPERATE REGIONS, AND THE FACTORS THAT TRIGGER ITS DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO FISHING COMMUNITIES ARE UNKNOWN. WE PERFORMED AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF RECREATIONAL CHARTER BOAT FISHERIES IN THE EASTERN NORTH ATLANTIC TO ASSESS THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIAL WELFARE. WE SELECTED TWO CASE STUDIES LOCATED IN GALICIA (NW SPAIN) AND MADEIRA ARCHIPELAGO (PORTUGAL). THE TWO CASES DIFFER IN THE SOCIOECOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES IN WHICH RECREATIONAL CHARTER BOAT FISHING IS DEVELOPED (E.G., RELEVANCE OF COMMERCIAL FISHING, TOURISM, OR TARGETED SPECIES), THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT. UP TO 7 CHARTER FISHING COMPANIES WERE IDENTIFIED IN GALICIA (10 BOATS) AND 14 IN MADEIRA (18 BOATS), AND INFORMATION ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE ACTIVITY WERE COLLECTED BY A QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERED BY COMPANY MANAGERS AND SKIPPERS. CHARTER BOATS IN GALICIA ARE OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND ANGLERS MOSTLY ENGAGE IN BOTTOM FISHING TARGETING DEMERSAL PREDATORS LIKE BALLAN WRASSE (LABRUS BERGYLTA) AND EUROPEAN SEABASS (DICENTRARCHUS LABRAX) THAT THEY RETAIN. DESPITE THE STRONG SEASONALITY OF THE FISHERY IN MADEIRA, FOCUSED ON SUMMERS, THE FISHING EFFORT IS HIGHER THAN IN GALICIA. ON AVERAGE, CHARTER BOATS GO FISHING FOR 39.3 ± 41.5 (SD) FISHING JOURNEYS AND TAKE 2 500 ANGLERS ON BOARD PER YEAR IN GALICIA, WHILE IN MADEIRA THEY FISH 63.7 ± 32.7 JOURNEYS AND TAKE 3 200 ANGLERS ON BOARD. ANGLERS TARGET IN MADEIRA PELAGIC TOP PREDATORS LIKE BLUE MARLIN (MAKAIRA NIGRICANS), OR SOME TUNA SPECIES, E.G., BIGEYE (THUNNUS OBESUS), BY TROLLING IN A CATCH AND RELEASE FISHERY. THE ECONOMIC BALANCE OF COMPANIES WAS MORE FAVORABLE IN MADEIRA, WITH AN AVERAGE GROSS ANNUAL PROFIT OF € 28 883 ± 30 755, WHILE ECONOMIC YIELD IN GALICIA WAS € 4 444 ± 7 916. WE ALSO APPLIED A TRAVEL COST METHOD TO ASSESS THE RECREATION DEMAND OF RECREATIONAL FISHING TRIPS BASED ON A QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERED BY 150 CLIENTS IN GALICIA AND 55 IN MADEIRA. WE ESTIMATED THE VISITOR SURPLUS MEAN VALUE TO BE € 1 385 PER YEAR IN GALICIA (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, CI95%= € 1 219 – € 1 550), AND € 1 738 IN MADEIRA (CI95%= € 1 433 – 2 043). THE SOCIAL ANNUAL RECREATION VALUE OF GALICIAN FISHERY WAS WORTH € 3.4 MILLION, RANGING BETWEEN € 3.0 M AND € 3.8 M, A VALUE WELL BELOW THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC IMPACT GENERATED BY COMMERCIAL FISHING (€ 700 M). THE RECREATION VALUE OF THE CHARTER BOAT FISHERY IN MADEIRA, € 6.3 M, RANGING BETWEEN € 5.2 M AND € 7.5 M, IS COMPARABLE TO THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL FISHING, THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY WITH € 12 M.

MAR. SCI.,"TO EFFECTIVELY FUTURE-PROOF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FISHING FLEETS WE HAVE EXPLORED A SUITE OF CASE STUDIES ENCOMPASSING THE NORTHEAST AND TROPICAL ATLANTIC, THE MEDITERRANEAN, BALTIC AND BLACK SEAS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT EUROPEAN UNION (EU) FISHERIES ARE LIKELY RESILIENT TO CLIMATE-DRIVEN SHORT-TERM STRESSES, BUT MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, FISHERIES’ LONG-TERM STOCK RESILIENCE CAN BE IMPROVED (AND THEREFORE BE MORE RESILIENT TO INCREASING CHANGES IN CLIMATE) BY ADOPTING ROBUST AND ADAPTIVE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, PROVIDED SUCH MEASURES ARE BASED ON SOUND SCIENTIFIC ADVICE WHICH INCLUDES UNCERTAINTY. SUCH MANAGEMENT REQUIRES REGULAR UPDATES OF BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE POINTS. SUCH UPDATES WILL DELINEATE SAFE BIOLOGICAL LIMITS FOR EXPLOITATION, PROVIDING BOTH HIGH LONG-TERM YIELDS WITH REDUCED RISK OF STOCK COLLAPSE WHEN AFFECTED BY SHORT-TERM STRESSES, AND ENHANCED COMPLIANCE WITH ADVICE TO AVOID HIGHER THAN INTENDED FISHING MORTALITY. HOWEVER, HIGH RESILIENCE OF THE EXPLOITED ECOSYSTEM DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE RESILIENCE OF THE ECONOMY OF EU FISHERIES FROM SUFFERING SHOCKS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED YIELDS, NEITHER TO A REDUCED CARBON FOOTPRINT IF FUEL USE INCREASES FROM LOWER STOCK ABUNDANCES. FUEL CONSUMPTION IS IMPACTED BY STOCK DEVELOPMENT, BUT ALSO BY CHANGES IN VESSEL AND GEAR TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS FISHING TECHNIQUES. IN THIS RESPECT, ENERGY-EFFICIENT FISHING TECHNOLOGIES ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE EU, THOUGH IMPLEMENTING THEM WOULD REQUIRE IMPROVING THE UPTAKE OF INNOVATIONS AND DEMONSTRATING TO STAKEHOLDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR BOTH REDUCED FUEL COSTS AND INCREASED CATCH RATES. A TRANSITION TOWARDS REDUCING FUEL CONSUMPTION AND COSTS WOULD NEED TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE SETUP OF EU REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS. OVERALL, TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE EU FISHERIES WITHIN A CHANGING CLIMATE, FLEXIBLE, ADAPTIVE, WELL-INFORMED AND WELL-ENFORCED MANAGEMENT IS NEEDED, WITH INCENTIVES PROVIDED FOR INNOVATIONS AND OCEAN LITERACY TO COPE WITH THE CHANGING CONDITIONS, WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE DEPENDENCY OF THE CAPTURE FISHING INDUSTRY ON FOSSIL FUELS. TO SUPPORT SUCH MANAGEMENT, WE PROVIDE 10 LESSONS TO CHARACTERIZE ‘WIN-WIN’ FISHING STRATEGIES FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH DEVELOP LEVERAGES IN WHICH FISHING EFFORT DEPLOYED CORRESPONDS TO MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE YIELD TARGETS AND COMMON FISHERIES POLICY MINIMAL EFFECTS OBJECTIVES. IN THESE STRATEGIES, HIGHER CATCH IS OBTAINED IN THE LONG RUN, LESS FUEL IS SPENT TO ATTAIN THE CATCH, AND THE FISHERIES HAVE A HIGHER RESISTANCE AND RESILIENCE TO SHOCK AND LONG-TERM FACTORS TO FACE CLIMATE-INDUCED STRESSES.

IN TROPICAL REGIONS, SEAWEED PRODUCTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A FEW SPECIES ONLY, BECAUSE OF THEIR HYDROCOLLOIDS USED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY. THERE IS A STRONG NEED TO IDENTIFY NEW APPLICATIONS OF RED SEAWEED SPECIES IN OTHER SECTORS SUCH AS AQUACULTURE. THEREFORE, TO DIVERSIFY THE CULTURE OF RED SEAWEEDS, MORE TROPICAL SPECIES NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND POTENTIAL APPLICATION IN AQUACULTURE, AND THEN, TO DEVELOP A METHOD FOR A SUSTAINABLE CULTIVATION OF NEW SEAWEED CANDIDATES AND ENHANCE THEIR ECONOMIC POTENTIAL. BASED ON THIS CONTEXT, WE ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF THE RED EDIBLE SEAWEED ACANTHOPHORA SPP., AN UNDER-VALUED SEAWEED SPECIES WHICH IS NATURALLY ABUNDANT IN TROPICAL COUNTRIES, AND KAPPAPHYCUS SPP., A COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE SEAWEED COMMONLY USED FOR POLYSACCHARIDE EXTRACTION. THE VAST CHEMICAL DIVERSITY OF SEAWEEDS (POLYSACCHARIDES, PHYTOHORMONES, AMINO ACIDS, AND PIGMENTS) HAS LED TO RESEARCH ON A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS IN AQUACULTURE, INCLUDING PATHOGEN CONTROL, IMMUNOSTIMULANT, ANTIOXIDANT, BIOREMEDIATION, FEED, UV PROTECTANTS, INCREASE IN SEAFOOD SHELF LIFE, ANIMAL COLORANT, AND GROWTH REGULATOR FOR MICROALGA CULTURE.

THIS STUDY ADDS MORE KNOWLEDGE AS IT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BLUE ECONOMIC FACTORS – LIVING AND NON-LIVING RESOURCES, OCEAN ENERGY, PORT ACTIVITIES, SHIPBUILDING AND REPAIR, MARITIME TRANSPORT, COASTAL TOURISM, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR, PER CAPITA INCOME, FISH CAPTURE, INTERNAL RENEWABLE WATER RESOURCES PER CAPITA, MARINE PROTECTED AREAS, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND POPULATION DENSITY, ALL FACTORS RELATED TO MARITIME ACTIVITIES – AND THE BLUE ECONOMY (BE) ITSELF. METHODS: IN ORDER TO REACH THESE OBJECTIVES, SOME SPECIAL ANALYTICAL AND ECONOMETRIC METHODS ARE USED. AMONG THEM THE MULTIVARIATE GRANGER CAUSALITY THEORY, THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS AND PANEL DATA TECHNIQUES ARE EMPLOYED. THIS SET OF METHODS HELPS US TO STUDY THE COMPLEX SET OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIOUS FACTORS RELATED TO THE BE AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON PER CAPITA INCOME (PCI) AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE DATA USED TO CONDUCT THIS RESEARCH WERE COLLECTED FROM THE EUROSTAT, THE E.U. STATISTICAL DATABASE. SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND THE SPAN PERIOD 2010-2018 ARE USED TOO. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS SHOWED EVIDENCE THAT PER CAPITA INCOME IS ASSOCIATED TO OTHER FACTORS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, THAT PCI (GRANGER) CAUSES COASTAL TOURISM AND POPULATION DENSITY, AND THAT THERE ARE FIVE OTHER FACTORS THAT POSITIVELY INFLUENCE PCI GROWTH, NAMELY, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (GHG), MARITIME TRANSPORT, NONLIVING RESOURCES AND PORTS’ ACTIVITIES. THIS PAPER ADDS SOME NEW UNDERSTANDINGS TO THEORY AND CALLS THE ATTENTION TO SOCIETY, IN GENERAL, AND THE BLUE ECONOMICS, IN PARTICULAR. FOR INSTANCE, IF POLICYMAKERS WANT TO INCREASE INCOME PER CAPITA OF THESE REGIONS, THEY SHOULD TAKE ACTION ON SOME VARIABLES SUCH AS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR (HDI), GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS, LIVING RESOURCES, MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OCEAN ENERGY. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT BLUE ECONOMY IS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO PROMOTE BOTH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PCI. DISCUSSION: THE CONCERNS THAT MAKE UP THE BLUE ECONOMY, SUCH AS OCEAN ENERGY, PORT ACTIVITIES, SHIP BUILDING AND REPAIR, MARITIME TRANSPORT, COASTAL TOURISM, HDI, MARITIME FISH CAPTURE, MARINE PROTECTED AREAS, AND GHG REDUCTIONARE GOOD FACTORS TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. AMONG THESE, THE MOST INFLUENCING ARE MARITIME TRANSPORT, LIVING RESOURCES AND THE PRODUCTION OF OCEAN ENERGY. THIS STUDY ADDS KNOWLEDGE TO THEORY, INNOVATES IN THE METHODS AND TECHNIQUES USED, IN THE RESULTS DISCOVERED, IN ITS DISCUSSION, AND IN THE MIXTURE OF BLUE ECONOMIC FACTORS, TOO. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST PAPERS THAT FILLS THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT BLUE ECONOMY.

MAR. SCI.,"FISHERS’ LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE (LEK) CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT OR SUPPLEMENT LONG-TERM TRENDS IN HEAVILY EXPLOITED POPULATION OR POORLY ASSESSED SPECIES WITH LOW BIOMASS. WE USED HISTORICAL MEMORIES OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF CHANGES IN CATCH TRENDS IN MARINE FISHERIES OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. THE STUDY AIMED AT EVALUATING HOW FISHERS COULD PROVIDE CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE DATA ON MAJOR FISH SPECIES/GROUPS COMPARABLE WITH OFFICIAL CATCH DATA AND TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF INCREASING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN FISHERY MANAGEMENT. WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS (FGDS) AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERIENCED FISHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, USING A STRUCTURED TEMPLATE RELATED TO THE CATCH AND EFFORT DATA. USING FGD DATA, WE SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARED CHANGES IN FISH CATCH RATES AND EFFORT OVER TIME AND SPACE. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON MAJOR GROUPS OF SPECIES THAT HAD REASONABLE LANDING OVER TIME. OVERALL, THE ANALYSIS REVEALED CHANGES IN CATCH RATE, MONTHLY LANDINGS PER LANDING CENTER, FACTORS THAT LIKELY INFLUENCE THE CATCH TRENDS, AND THE SPATIAL EXPANSION OF FISHERIES. OUR STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO SPECIES’ ABUNDANCE OVER TIME. FISHERS’ LEK SHOWS DECLINING CATCH RATES FOR MAJOR SPECIES AND GROUPS, BUT MONTHLY HARVESTS AT LANDING CENTERS HAVE INCREASED OVER TWO DECADES BECAUSE OF INCREASED FISHING EFFORTS. SMALL-SCALE FISHERS ARE CATCHING MORE FISH FROM DEEPER WATERS OVER TIME, INDICATING A GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT OF FISHERIES BEYOND TRADITIONALLY EXPLOITED AREAS. SUCH EXPANSIONS OF NEARSHORE FISHERIES MAY RESULT FROM THE OVERFISHING OF NEARBY AREAS. ON THE CONTRARY, THIS COULD BE VIEWED AS A POSITIVE INDICATION OF THE POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES IN THE REGION, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BLUE ECONOMY. THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN OFFICIAL STATISTICS AND FISHERS’ DATA ON SPECIES CATCH TRENDS OVER TIME SUGGESTS THAT FISHERS HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR FISHING SYSTEM. THIS INDICATES THAT FISHERS’ KNOWLEDGE COULD BE INVALUABLE, ESPECIALLY IN DATA-POOR AREAS. LEK INTEGRATION INTO POLICY AND MANAGEMENT IS THUS EXPECTED TO FACILITATE THE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES.

WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE STATUS QUO DOES NOT MEET THE DIVERSE DEVELOPMENT ASPIRATIONS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES OR ENSURE HEALTHY OCEANS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE BLUE ECONOMY IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO USD2.5–3 TRILLION BY 2030, AND THERE IS PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ITS POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY IN LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES, AND TO SUPPORT A BLUE RECOVERY FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SELECTIVE, THEMATIC REVIEW OF THE BLUE ECONOMY LITERATURE TO EXAMINE: (I) THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES, (II) THE BARRIERS AND ENABLERS THAT SHAPE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND (III) THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY COMMUNITIES AND SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH CAN BE STRENGTHENED TO DELIVER A ‘SUSTAINABLE' BLUE ECONOMY AND IMPROVE SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. OUR REVIEW FINDS THAT UNDER BUSINESS-AS-USUAL AND BLUE GROWTH, INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES, LARGE-SCALE AQUACULTURE, LAND RECLAMATION, MINING, AND OIL AND GAS RAISE RED FLAGS FOR COMMUNITIES AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. WHEREAS, IF MANAGED SUSTAINABLY, SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES, COASTAL AQUACULTURE, SEAWEED FARMING AND ECO-TOURISM ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO DELIVER BENEFITS TO COMMUNITIES. YET, THESE ARE ALSO THE SECTORS MOST VULNERABLE TO NEGATIVE AND CUMULATIVE IMPACTS FROM OTHER SECTORS. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF ENABLERS, BARRIERS AND STRATEGIES, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT PUTTING COASTAL COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTER OF A CLEAR VISION FOR AN INCLUSIVE SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY AND CO-DEVELOPING A SHARED AND ACCESSIBLE LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITIES, PRACTITIONERS AND POLICY-MAKERS IS ESSENTIAL FOR A MORE EQUITABLE OCEAN ECONOMY, ALONGSIDE MAINSTREAMING SOCIAL JUSTICE PRINCIPLES AND INTEGRATED GOVERNANCE THAT CAN BRIDGE DIFFERENT SCALES OF ACTION AND OPPORTUNITY.

IT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD TO RELATE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OCEAN IN A MANNER WHICH ALSO ADDRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT OCEAN HEALTH IN THE FACE OF INCREASING DEMANDS ON OCEAN RESOURCES, MARINE POLLUTION, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. WHILE THE BLUE ECONOMY HOLDS POTENTIAL TO ACT AS AN INTEGRATING POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OCEAN, TO DATE, THERE ARE LIMITED EXAMPLES OF IMPLEMENTATION IN PRACTICE TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF THE CONCEPT. BASED ON A TYPOLOGY OF “GOOD GOVERNANCE” ADAPTED FROM EXISTING GLOBAL TYPOLOGIES, WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF BLUE ECONOMY GOVERNANCE IN ENABLING INTEGRATION. WE USED A MIXED METHODS APPROACH TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCE OF SEYCHELLES, A BLUE ECONOMY EARLY ADOPTER, COMBINING POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS, SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH KEY ACTORS AND PARTNERS, AND COUNTRY FIELDWORK. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT FROM ITS INCEPTION, SEYCHELLES' VISION OF BLUE ECONOMY WAS A TRANSFORMATIVE MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE PROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF OCEAN RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFIT OF SEYCHELLOIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE SDGS. THANKS TO EARLY POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AND INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT, THE ADOPTION OF THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING AWARENESS OF THE OCEAN HEALTH AND ITS CONNECTION TO PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY, AND IN ESTABLISHING THE BASIS OF A NATIONAL BLUE ECONOMY “ARCHITECTURE,” WHICH HELPED SECURE INNOVATIVE FINANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. TRANSITIONING TO IMPLEMENTATION, SEVERAL GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES EMERGED, WHICH INCLUDED MAINTAINING HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL MOMENTUM, STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, AND INSTITUTIONAL COORDINATION AND CAPACITY. WHILE SOME GOVERNANCE BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION MAY BE UNIQUE TO SEYCHELLES, SOME ARE COMMON TO SIDS, AND OTHERS ARE FOUND IN A RANGE OF GOVERNANCE SETTINGS. SEYCHELLES INTERNATIONAL VISIBILITY HAS BROUGHT HIGH EXPECTATIONS, NOT ALWAYS COMMENSURATE WITH LOCAL ASPIRATIONS, CAPABILITIES, AND JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

SUSTAIN.,"KUWAIT'S “BLUE ECONOMY” PROJECT AIMS TO HELP REPLACE THE COUNTRY'S OIL AND GAS INCOME BY THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS MARINE RESOURCES. THE FISHING INDUSTRY HAS A PRIME PLACE IN THE “BLUE ECONOMY” PROJECT, BUT NINE OF THE MAIN FISH SPECIES IN KUWAIT HAVE RECENTLY DECLINED RUBIAN (SHRIMP), ZOBAIDI (SILVER POMFRET), SUBOOR (HILSA SHAD), NAQROOR (JAVELIN GRUNTER), HAMOOR (ORANGE-SPOTTED GROUPER), HAMRA (MALABAR BLOOD SNAPPER), HALWAYUH (BLACK POMFRET), FRUSH (TROUT SWEETLIPS), AND KASUR (LIZARD FISH). THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE NATURE OF POLLUTION IN KUWAITI WATERS, EXAMINING ITS EXTENT AND CAUSES, QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A PRIMARY REASON FOR FISH DECLINE, AND DISCUSSING WHAT MEASURES COULD BE TAKEN TO REDUCE OR REMOVE IT. THE DATA FOR THIS STUDY WERE GATHERED FROM PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES, OFFICIAL KUWAITI STATISTICS AND REPORTS, AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED IN KUWAIT WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE FISHERIES INCLUDING STAFF IN THE KUWAITI SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE, THE FISHERY PROTECTION AUTHORITY, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AUTHORITY AND GOVERNMENTAL DEPARTMENTS; FISHERS; AND FISHERY BUSINESS OWNERS. THE MAIN FINDING OF THIS STUDY IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE WEAK GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO COUNTER POLLUTION, POLLUTION DOES EXIST IN KUWAITI WATERS, BUT THERE IS NO SOLID EVIDENCE THAT IT HAS A DIRECT LINK TO THE DECLINE IN FISH STOCKS. OVERFISHING, ESPECIALLY BY ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED (IUU) VESSELS, SEEMS TO BE A MORE SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE OF THE DECLINE IN FISH STOCKS. COPYRIGHT © 2021 ALQATTAN AND GRAY.",NA,"M.E.A.

SUSTAIN. FOOD SYST.,"TO LIMIT COMPROMISING THE INTEGRITY OF THE PLANET, A SHIFT IS NEEDED TOWARDS FOOD PRODUCTION WITH LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND LOW CARBON FOOTPRINT. HOW TO PUT SUCH TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION WHILST ENSURING FOOD SECURITY INTO PRACTICE REMAINS A CHALLENGE AND WILL REQUIRE TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES. COMBINING EXPERTISE FROM NATURAL- AND SOCIAL SCIENCES AS WELL AS INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVES, AN ALTERNATIVE VISION FOR THE FUTURE IN THE MARINE REALM IS PROPOSED. THIS VISION INCLUDES MOVING TOWARDS AQUACULTURE MAINLY OF LOW TROPHIC MARINE (LTM) SPECIES. SUCH SHIFT MAY ENABLE A BLUE TRANSFORMATION THAT CAN SUPPORT A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY. IT INCLUDES A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE AND PROACTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY-MAKING WHICH CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHERS, THE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC NATURE OF ALLOCATION OF MARINE SPACE AND SOCIETAL ACCEPTANCE OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OVER AND ABOVE THE DECARBONIZATION OF FOOD PRODUCTION, VIS Á VIS REDUCING REGULATORY BARRIERS FOR THE INDUSTRY FOR LTM WHILST ACKNOWLEDGING THE COMPLEXITIES OF UPSCALING AND OUTSCALING. THIS NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED BY TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CO-PRODUCED WITH CONSUMERS AND WIDER PUBLIC, AS A BLUE TRANSFORMATION TOWARDS ACCELERATING LTM AQUACULTURE OPPORTUNITIES IN A NET ZERO-CARBON WORLD CAN ONLY OCCUR BY CONSIDERING THE DEMANDS OF SOCIETY.

SUSTAIN. FOOD SYST.,"THIS STUDY UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF SELECTED MARICULTURE ENTERPRISES IN THE COASTAL REGIONS OF INDIA, CENTERED ON LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY AS THE KEY FOCUS. THIS IS JUXTAPOSED AGAINST INDIA'S AMBITIOUS BLUE ECONOMY TARGETS AND POLICY THRUST THAT PIN ON THE EXPANSION OF MARICULTURE AS A PROMISING AVENUE FOR ENHANCING MARINE FISH PRODUCTION. FARM-LEVEL, REGION-SPECIFIC, TECHNO-ECONOMIC, AND SOCIO-CULTURAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH, AND CONDITIONAL ON, SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION OF MARICULTURE-BASED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL. THE PRINCIPLES-CRITERIA-INDICATORS (PCI) APPROACH IS USED TO ESTABLISH THE LINKAGE BETWEEN IDENTIFIED FARM-LEVEL INDICATORS AND VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY. WHILE THE SELECTED ENTERPRISES WERE ASSESSED TO BE TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE IN GENERAL, GLARING GAPS WERE EVIDENT ON KEY INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABILITY SUCH AS THE LEGITIMACY OF ACCESS OVER WATER BODIES, USE OF QUALITY SEED AND FEED, INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT ACCESS, MARKET ACCESS, AND FAIR MARKETING PRACTICES, OPTIMAL STOCKING DENSITY, MECHANIZATION, USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL-FRIENDLY CULTURE PRACTICES, FARM SURVEILLANCE, CREW SAFETY, AND SOCIAL PROTECTION. THIS INDICATES THE NEED FOR TAKING PROACTIVE MEASURES TO ENSURE THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF MARICULTURE, PARTICULARLY IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF ESTABLISHMENT WHEN SUCH INTERVENTIONS ARE EASY TO ADOPT. BASED ON THE INSIGHTS OBTAINED FROM THE ANALYSIS, A BROAD SET OF STRATEGIES, POLICY OPTIONS, AND INSTITUTIONAL INTERVENTIONS CRITICAL TO SCALING-UP COASTAL MARICULTURE ENTERPRISES ALONG THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF INDIA ARE PRESENTED.

FUNGI HAVE A LEADING ROLE IN MARINE BIOPROSPECTING SINCE THEY REPRESENT A PROLIFIC SOURCE OF STRUCTURALLY DIVERSE BIOACTIVE METABOLITES. SEVERAL BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS FROM MARINE FUNGI HAVE ALREADY BEEN CHARACTERIZED INCLUDING ANTIBIOTICS, ANTICANCER, ANTIOXIDANTS AND ANTIVIRALS. NOWADAYS, THE SEARCH FOR NATURAL ANTIOXIDANT MOLECULES CAPABLE OF REPLACING THOSE SYNTHETIC CURRENTLY USED, IS AN ASPECT THAT IS RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION. ANTIOXIDANTS CAN INACTIVATE REACTIVE OXYGEN AND NITROGEN SPECIES, PREVENTING THE INSURGENCE OF SEVERAL DEGENERATIVE DISEASES INCLUDING CANCER, AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS, CARDIOVASCULAR AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES.

IN GENERAL, ISLANDS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ENERGY IMPORTS WHICH, IN TURN, FEATURE A MARKED SEASONAL DEMAND. EFFORTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THESE REGIONS CAN THEREFORE FULFILL A TWOFOLD OBJECTIVE: (I) TO INCREASE THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SHARE FOR GLOBAL DECARBONIZATION AND (II) TO REDUCE THE EXTERNAL ENERGY DEPENDENCE FOR ISOLATED (OR INTERCONNECTED) SYSTEMS IN WHICH THIS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH AN INCREASE OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SHARE. HOWEVER, THE INCREASE IN RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES MAKES ENERGY GENERATION MORE DEPENDENT ON FUTURE CLIMATE AND ITS VARIABILITY. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYZE FUTURE PROJECTIONS OF WIND AND PHOTOVOLTAIC POTENTIAL, AS WELL AS ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY DROUGHTS, ON THE MAIN EURO-MEDITERRANEAN ISLANDS. DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS IN LAND SURFACE AVAILABLE IN THE ISLANDS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPACITY, THE ANALYSIS IS EXTENDED TO OFFSHORE WIND AND PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY, WHICH MAY HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FUTURE INCREASES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SHARE. TO THAT END, WE USE CLIMATE VARIABLES FROM A SERIES OF SIMULATIONS DERIVED FROM EURO-CORDEX (COORDINATED DOWNSCALING EXPERIMENT) SIMULATIONS FOR THE RCP2.6 AND RCP8.5 EMISSION SCENARIOS. A SPECIAL EFFORT IS PERFORMED TO NORMALIZE PROJECTED CHANGES AND THE ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTIES.

THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES AN EXCURSUS ON THE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT ON OFFSHORE GEOTHERMAL AREAS WORLDWIDE. WE FOCUSED ON THE ENERGY POTENTIAL CAPACITY OF THE MARSILI VOLCANIC SEAMOUNT LOCATED OVER THE BATHIAL PLAIN OF THE TYRRHENIAN BASIN, DESCRIBING THE DETAILED GEOLOGICAL, GEOCHEMICAL, AND GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT ON THAT SEAMOUNT SINCE THE 2000S. ALL THE COLLECTED DATA HAVE SHOWN EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EXISTENCE OF AN EXPLOITABLE GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE MARSILI SEAMOUNT CONSISTING OF A RESERVOIR OF SUPERCRITICAL GEOTHERMAL FLUIDS OF ABOUT 100 KM3. WE DISCUSS AND EVALUATE THE ACTUAL CONSISTENCE OF THE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF POTENTIAL RISKS. WE ALSO DESCRIBE THE NECESSARY FURTHER STEPS TOWARDS THE PILOT WELL.

SEAWEED RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED MAINLY ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND TAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION OF 628 SPECIES IDENTIFIED SO FAR, MAINLY IN THE CARIBBEAN SEA. AMONG THE MOST WIDELY CULTIVATED GENERA OF SEAWEEDS IN OPEN-SEA PILOT SYSTEMS IN COLOMBIA ARE HYDROPUNTIA, GRACILARIA, HYPNEA, KAPPAPHYCUS, AND EUCHEUMA. THESE GENERA HAVE SHOWN LOW YIELDS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIGH TISSUE FRAGILITY, EPIPHYTISM, SEDIMENTATION, AND NITROGEN DEFICIENCY. IN ADDITION, THE EVALUATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF SELECTED SEAWEED COMPOUNDS HAS ADVANCED CONSIDERABLY, FOCUSING ON THEIR COMPOSITION AND THEIR USE FOR DIRECT CONSUMPTION BY HUMANS AND ANIMALS. DESPITE THE DIVERSITY OF SEAWEEDS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES, COLOMBIA IS STILL LAGGING BEHIND OTHER COUNTRIES IN SEAWEED EXPLOITATION, BOTH IN LATIN AMERICA AND WORLDWIDE. THIS CURRENT STATUS RAISES THE NEED TO INCREASE RESEARCH, TECHNOLOGICAL (AGRO-TECH) APPROPRIATION, AND THE ADOPTION OF EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICIES THAT WILL BOOST ALGAL BUSINESSES.

IN PARTICULAR, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IMPLEMENTING A NUMBER OF PROJECTS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP) TOOLS. THE BALTIC SEA IS CONSIDERED AS A PILOT REGION, WHERE A PAN-BALTIC COORDINATED MSP PLAN HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND BLUE GROWTH IN THE MARINE AND COASTAL ECONOMY. THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS ONE OF THE BALTIC COUNTRIES, BUT THE MSP PROCEDURE AT THE STATE LEVEL DOES NOT HAVE INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY SUPPORT, WHICH REQUIRES THE ELIMINATION OF GAPS AND ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARITIME MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THE LAWS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF MANAGEMENT ARE USED IN THIS STUDY. AN INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE MARINE AND COASTAL USE IS PROPOSED AS A TOOL FOR ENSURING BLUE GROWTH, INCLUDING FOUR INTERRELATED ELEMENTS (SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS), NAMELY “INTEGRATED COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT”, “MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING”, “MANAGEMENT OF MARINE MACROREGION” AND “OCEAN GOVERNANCE”. THEIR FUNCTIONAL CONTENT AND INTERACTION MECHANISMS ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT AN INTEGRAL APPROACH TO MARINE USE. THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE PROPOSED INTEGRAL MODEL INCLUDES THREE LEVELS CORRESPONDING TO THE FEDERAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE LEVEL OF MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNANCE.

RISK. FINANC. MANAG.,"THE BLUE BOND MARKET HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE LATEST ADDITIONS IN THE SUSTAINABLE DEBT MARKET. ITS GOAL IS TO CHANNEL FUNDING TOWARD SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY PROJECTS RELATED TO THE OCEAN AND FRESHWATER. WHILE THE PROTECTION OF HYDRIC RESOURCES HAS GAINED IMPORTANCE WITHIN THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS LINKED TO WATER REMAIN THE MOST UNDERFUNDED. SINCE THE ISSUANCE OF THE FIRST BLUE BOND IN THE SEYCHELLES IN 2018, MULTIPLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TURNED TO THE BLUE BOND MARKET TO RAISE FUNDS. HOWEVER, UNLIKE THE GREEN BOND MARKET, NO COMPREHENSIVE MARKET OVERVIEW EXISTS, PREVENTING STAKEHOLDERS FROM JUDGING WHETHER THIS LABEL HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING WATER RESOURCES AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ON ITS FUTURE POTENTIAL. THIS PAPER DRAWS ON AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND COMPLEMENTS IT WITH A UNIQUE AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF BLUE BONDS ISSUED TO DATE, PROVIDING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE ON SUSTAINABLE FINANCE. BETWEEN 2018 AND 2022, 26 BLUE BOND TRANSACTIONS TOOK PLACE, AMOUNTING TO A TOTAL VALUE OF USD 5.0 BILLION, WITH A 92% CAGR BETWEEN THOSE YEARS. CURRENTLY, BLUE BONDS REPRESENT LESS THAN 0.5% OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEBT MARKET. THE USE OF PROCEEDS HAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON WASTE MANAGEMENT, BIODIVERSITY, AND SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES, BUT ALSO RANGES ACROSS OTHER AREAS OF THE SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY. ONLY TWO-THIRDS OF BLUE BOND ISSUERS REPORT ON IMPACT METRICS, PROVIDING FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ADD DETAIL AND RIGOR. WE DRAW COMPARISONS TO THE MORE MATURE GREEN BOND MARKET AND CONCLUDE THAT A LACK OF STANDARDIZED DEFINITIONS, METRICS, AND EXPERTISE BY ISSUERS AND INVESTORS ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO THE BLUE BOND MARKET.

SECOND, TO FIGURE OUT WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS ARE INVOLVED IN THE POLICY PLANNING PROCESS AND WHETHER THIS SPHERE OF LOCAL POLITICS IS TRANSPARENT AND OPEN TO PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS? THIRD, TO FIND OUT WHICH SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND COASTAL BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPTS ARE GIVEN PRIORITY IN THE MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES?

IN EACH SEA BASIN, MULTI-USE PLAYS A DIFFERENT ROLE AS CONCERNS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE EASTERN BALTIC SEA, THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND THE BLACK SEA, THE MU FOCUS SHOULD REMAIN ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PILLAR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN THE NORTH SEA, NORTH ATLANTIC AND WESTERN BALTIC SEA, ADDRESSING SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY SEEMS A KEY PRECONDITION FOR SUCCESS OF MU IN ENHANCEMENT OF SUSTAINABLE SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT AT SEA. MOREOVER, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO INTRODUCE MU KEY GLOBAL STRATEGIES SUCH AS SDGS OR MACROREGIONAL STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS AND TO SUPPLEMENT MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING WITH SECTORAL INCENTIVES AND EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS AS KEY VEHICLES SUPPORTING MU. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING ASPECTS WHICH, IN ORDER TO INFORM MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING AND MARITIME GOVERNANCE REGARDING A MORE CONSCIOUS APPLICATION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CONCEPT, REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION. KEY TASKS ARE RELATED TO: MORE PROFOUND EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE OF POLICIES SUPPORTING MUS, RESEARCHING THE IMPACT OF MU ON SOCIETAL GOALS AND ON THE MU COSTS AND BENEFITS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL ONES, AND FINALLY IDENTIFYING THE IMPACT OF MU ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS SECTORS AND REGIONS ON LAND. © 2021 BY THE AUTHOR.

THEREFORE, CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF THIS PIVOTAL AQUATIC MACRO-SYSTEM IS NECESSARY, THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF MONITORING METH-ODOLOGIES. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A PREDICTION MODEL FOR HEAVY METALS ACCUMULATION IN BIOLOGICAL TISSUES, BASED ON FIELD GATHERED DATA WHICH USES BIOINDICATORS (FISH) AND OXIDATIVE STRESS (OS) BIOMARKERS. SAMPLES OF WATER AND FISH WERE COLLECTED FROM THE LOWER SECTOR OF DANUBE RIVER (DR), DANUBE DELTA (DD) AND BLACK SEA (BS). THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS WERE ANALYZED IN SAMPLES: CADMIUM (CD), LEAD (PB), IRON (FE), ZINC (ZN), COPPER (CU) (IN WATER AND FISH TISSUES), RESPECTIVELY, CATALASE (CAT), SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD), GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE (GPX), MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) (IN FISH TISSUES). THE POLLUTION INDEX (PI) WAS CALCULATED TO IDENTIFY THE MOST POLLUTED STUDIED ECOSYSTEM, WHICH REVEALED THAT DANUBE RIVER IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF FE (IP = 4887) AND STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ZN (IP = 4.49). THE CONCENTRATION OF CD IN FISH MUSCLE TISSUE WAS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVEL (0.05 ΜG/G) BY THE EU REGULA-TION. FROM ALL ANALYZED OS BIOMARKERS, MDA REGISTERED THE HIGHEST MEDIAN VALUES IN FISH MUSCLE (145.7 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN DR, 201.03 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN DD, 148.58 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN BS) AND FISH LIVER (200.28 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN DR, 163.67 NMOL/MG PROTEIN, 158.51 NMOL/MG PROTEIN), COM-PARED TO CAT, SOD AND GPX. THE PREDICTION OF CD, PB, ZN, FE AND CU IN FISH HEPATIC AND MUSCLE TISSUE WAS DETERMINED BASED ON CAT, SOD, GPX AND MDA, BY USING NON-LINEAR TREE-BASED RF PREDICTION MODELS. THE ANALYSIS EMPHASIZES THAT MDA IN HEPATIC TISSUE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INDE-PENDENT VARIABLE FOR PREDICTING HEAVY METALS IN FISH MUSCLE AND TISSUES AT BS COAST, FOLLOWED BY GPX IN BOTH HEPATIC AND MUSCLE TISSUES. THE RF ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK REVEALED THAT CAT IN MUSCLE TISSUE, RESPECTIVELY, MDA AND GPX IN HEPATIC TISSUES ARE MOST COMMON PREDICTORS FOR DETERMINING THE HEAVY METALS CONCENTRATION IN BOTH MUSCLE AND HEPATIC TISSUES IN DD AREA. FOR DR, THE MDA IN MUSCLE, FOLLOWED BY MDA IN HEPATIC TISSUE ARE THE MAIN PREDICTORS IN RF ANALYSIS. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS. LICENSEE MDPI, BASEL, SWITZERLAND.",NA,"I.-A.

HOWEVER, CLIMATE CHANGE REPRESENTS A MAIN BARRIER TO FULLY REALIZING A BE. ENABLING CONDITIONS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF A BE AND INCREASE ITS CLIMATE RESILIENCY MUST BE PROMOTED. ROMANIA HAS HIGH POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EU BE DUE TO ITS GEO-GRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, NAMELY THE PRESENCE OF THE DANUBE DELTA–BLACK SEA MACROSYSTEM, WHICH IS PART OF THE ROMANIAN LOWER DANUBE EUROREGION (RLDE). AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES REPRESENT A SECTOR WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF THE BE IN THE RLDE, A SITUATION WHICH IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS FOR BOTH HALTING BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND MAINTAINING THE PROPER CONDITIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE EXISTING MACROSYSTEM. IT IS KNOWN THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS, ACCENTUATES WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS AND LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY AND INDUCES THE DESTRUCTION OF HABITATS, WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO FISH STOCK DEPLETION. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON MULTIPLE LINEAR PREDICTIVE AND FORECAST MODELS THAT OFFERS COST‐EFFICIENT TOOLS FOR THE MONITORING AND CONTROL OF WATER QUALITY, FISH STOCK DYNAMICS AND BIODIVERSITY IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY OF THE BE OF THE RLDE IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE FOLLOWING WATER‐DEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE CONSIDERED: TOTAL NITROGEN (TN); TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP); DISSOLVED OXYGEN (DO); PH; WATER TEMPERATURE (WT); AND WATER LEVEL, ALL OF WHICH WERE MEASURED BASED ON A SERIES OF 26 PHYSICOCHEMICAL INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH 4 SAMPLING AREAS WITHIN THE RLDE (BRĂILA, GALAȚI, TULCEA AND SULINA COUNTIES). PREDICTIVE MODELS BASED ON FISH SPECIES CATCHES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GALATI COUNTY DANUBE RIVER BASIN SEGMENT AND THE ʺDANUBE DELTA” BIOSPHERE RESERVE ADMINISTRATION TERRITORY WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH AN EFFICIENT TOOL FOR MONITORING FISH STOCK DYNAMICS AND STRUCTURES AS WELL AS IDENTIFY METHODS OF CONTROLLING FISH BIODIVERSITY IN THE RLDE TO ENHANCE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE OF THE ALREADY‐EXISTING BE AND ITS EXPANSION (BLUE GROWTH) IN THE CONTEXT OF AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE VARIATION. THE STUDY AREA REFLECTS THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF THE EMERGING BE, FOCUSED ON THE OCEAN, SEAS, LAKES AND RIVERS ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS AGENDA. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZED THE VULNERABILITY OF THE RLDE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, A SITUATION REVEALED BY THE WATER LEVEL, AIR TEMPERATURE AND WATER QUALITY PARAMETER TREND LINES AND FORECAST MODELS. CONSIDERING THE SAMPLING DESIGN APPLIED WITHIN THE RLDE, IT CAN BE STATED THAT THE TULCEA COUNTY DANUBE SECTOR WAS LESS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE COMPARED WITH THE GALAȚI COUNTY SECTOR AS CONFIRMED BY WATER TN AND TP FORECAST ANALYSIS, WHICH REVEALED HIGHER INCREASING TRENDS IN GALAȚI COMPARED WITH TULCEA. THE FISH STOCK BIODIVERSITY WAS PROVEN TO BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL WARMING WITHIN THE RLDE, SINCE PEACEFUL SPECIES HAD A HIGHER UPWARD TREND COMPARED WITH PREDATORY SPECIES. WATER LEVEL AND AIR TEMPERATURE FORECASTING ANALYSIS PROVED TO BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MONITORING IN THE STUDY AREA. THE RESULTING ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK CONFIRMED THAT TIME SERIES METHODS COULD BE USED TOGETHER WITH MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION METHODS TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR SYNERGETIC ABILITIES FOR MONITORING AND PREDICTING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE MARINE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE BE SECTOR WITHIN THE RLDE. THE FORECASTING MODELS DEVELOPED IN THE PRESENT STUDY WERE MEANT TO BE USED AS METHODS OF REVEALING FUTURE INFORMATION, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR DECISION MAKERS TO ADOPT PROPER MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT OR LIMIT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE BE. THROUGH THE IDENTIFIED INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, PREDICTION MODELS OFFER A SOLUTION FOR MANAGING THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING LESS COST‐DEMANDING AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT MONITORING ACTIVITIES. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE RESULTS OF THIS SCIENTIFIC AND POLICY REVIEW SHOW THAT, WHEREAS FOR SOME TRADITIONAL MARITIME ACTIVITIES SUCH AS FISHERIES, THE DRIVERS OF EXCLUSION ARE WELL STUDIED AND SOMEHOW ADDRESSED IN POLICIES, FOR OTHER EMERGING SECTORS, SUCH AS OCEAN ENERGIES OR DEEP-SEA MINING, THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ON HOW TO RECOGNISE AND PREVENT THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXCLUSION. EXCLUSION IS LIKELY TO OCCUR WHEN DECISIONS ARE TAKEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL TARGETS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, FOOD SAFETY, CLEAN ENERGY OR LEISURE, WITH LITTLE CONSIDERATION OF THE EFFECTS ON LOCAL ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF INCLUSIVENESS ARE GIVEN DUE CONSIDERATION, THEY PROVE TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE SOCIETIES’ WELL-BEING, INCREASING THE CHANCE OF LONG-TERM SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY.

WE REVIEW THE EXPLORATORY SYSTEM AND CLASSIFY THE STAKEHOLDERS AND DRIVING FORCES BEHIND NATURE EXPLOITATION. BASED ON SUCCESSFUL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CASES, WE PROPOSE PRACTICAL MODIFICATIONS FOR ADDING ECONOMIC VALUE TO RESTORING COLLAPSED ECOSYSTEMS, RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLUE MANAGEMENT. BLUE MANAGEMENT ISOLATES SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS NATURE EXPLOITERS, GOVERNMENTAL BODIES, AND NATURE SCIENTISTS. WE PROPOSE THE DIVISION OF NATURE USERS INTO LARGE FOOTPRINTING COMPANIES (FUNDERS), NATURAL RESOURCES EXPLOITERS INDUSTRY (MANAGERS), AND SUBSISTENCE EXPLOITERS (WORKFORCE) AND EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NATURE EXPLOITERS AND NATURAL SCIENTISTS TO ACCELERATE THE RESTORATION OF THREATENED NATURAL RESOURCES. BLUE MANAGEMENT OFFERS STAKEHOLDERS PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES FOR IMPROVING COLLAPSED/THREATENED NATURAL ASSETS (ECOSYSTEMS) BASED ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ECOLOGICAL THEORIES. IT PROVIDES A SUMMARIZED PATHWAY FOR DECISION-MAKERS TO RESTORE UNPRODUCTIVE RESOURCES, AVOIDING THE MIGRATION OF THE EXPLORATORY SYSTEM TO NEW PRISTINE RESOURCES. IN SUMMARY, BLUE MANAGEMENT IS A PRACTICAL APPROACH THAT COMBINES ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ECOLOGICAL THEORIES TO RESTORE THREATENED ECOSYSTEMS.

WORLDWIDE TOURISM KEEPS GROWING, AND SEVERAL PHENOMENA HAVE DETERMINED SOME TRENDS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO RECREATIONAL AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. TOURISM INFLICTS A HIGH PRESSURE ON COASTAL RESOURCES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS.

SOC. SCI.,"THE SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES SECTOR PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE LIVELIHOODS, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF A LARGE POPULATION IN SRI LANKA. IN THE OVERALL FISHERIES SECTOR, THE CONTRIBUTION OF COASTAL FISHERIES, WHICH IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY SMALL-SCALE FISHERS (SSFS), HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HIGH. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, IT HAS STARTED TO DECLINE. CHANGES OCCURRING AT LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALES IN THE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND POLICY SPHERES HAVE IMPACTED SRI LANKAN SSFS DIFFERENTLY, INCREASING THEIR VULNERABILITIES. DRAWING ON A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE MULTIPLE VULNERABILITIES FACED BY SSFS IN SRI LANKA, RELATING TO FOUR MAJOR THEMES: (1) PALK BAY GEOPOLITICS; (2) THE WAR; (3) THE TSUNAMI AND POST-TSUNAMI RECOVERY; (4) POST-WAR DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY PRIORITIES. THIS PAPER BUILDS A CASE FOR UNDERSTANDING THESE VULNERABILITIES AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY CONTINUE, REEMERGE AND THREATEN SSFS AND THEIR FUTURE LIVELIHOODS. IT ARGUES THAT, IN THE WAKE OF NEW THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY POST-WAR DEVELOPMENT, POLICY CHANGES AND GEOPOLITICAL CONSTRAINTS, GREATER ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO SSFS.

THE CONCLUSIONS LIST THOSE AREAS WHERE FURTHER MODELING OR STUDIES ARE WARRANTED AND REQUIRED WITH THE OBJECTIVE BEING TO BUILD AN INTEGRATED MODELING TOOL TO ASSIST COMPANIES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND NGO'S IN ASSESSING THE BENEFITS AND RISKS FOR REPURPOSING SPECIFIC FACILITIES. 30CFR 585J CAN BE USED TO EXPEDITE PERMITTING THE DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THIS REGULATION SPECIFICALLY IS WRITTEN TO ALLOW ADDITION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND OTHER MARINE ACTIVITIES ON TO EXISTING OIL AND GAS LEASES AND IS WRITTEN BROADLY ENOUGH IT CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES. FOR THE TRANSITION TO OCCUR THE CURRENT POLICY OF REMOVING NON-PRODUCING ASSETS MUST BE STOPPED. THESE FACILITIES, PROVIDING THEY ARE STILL IN GOOD REPAIR, CAN BE A TREMENDOUS ASSET THAT CAN ACCELERATE THE DECARBONIZATION OF THE GULF COAST REGION, AND BECOME THE BASIS FOR AN INDUSTRIAL TRANSITION THAT WILL CREATE MORE EMPLOYMENT AND VALUE THAN EVEN THE PEAK OF OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS. THE GULF OF MEXICO HAS AN EXCELLENT OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL. NREL PLACES THE TOTAL GROSS RESOURCE AVAILABLE AT 2000GW AND THE TECHNICAL (RECOVERABLE) RESOURCE AT 500GW. NEITHER VALUE INCLUDES GEOTHERMAL, AND BECAUSE OF THE CONSERVATIVE WAY THE NREL CALCULATES THE RESOURCES THE ACTUAL POTENTIAL IS AT LEAST TWICE AS LARGE. THE DOE STUDY, SUMMARIZED IN THIS PAPER, PROVIDES DETAILED ANSWER TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: • WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF LEGACY PLATFORMS, WELLS, AND PIPELINES TO RENEWABLE ENERGY AND BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES? • WHAT RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND CAN BE DEPLOYED SAFELY ON EXISTING LEASES? • WHAT BLUE ECONOMY INDUSTRIES CAN BE FACILITATED BY USING LEGACY ASSETS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO? • WHO CAN APPLY FOR AND WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR REPURPOSING EXISTING ASSETS OR ADDING NEW ASSETS TO EXISTING LEASES? • WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO THE CURRENT OWNERS, THE GULF COAST REGION, AND ENVIRONMENT?

ANNU. OFFSHORE TECHNOL. CONF.,"THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF $1.5 TRILLION ANNUALLY, WHICH IS PREDICTED TO DOUBLE BY 2030 (NOAA, 2021). AS R&D FUNDING FOR WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS (WECS) CONTINUES TO RISE GLOBALLY, WAVE POWER COSTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO FALL; THIS, IN TANDEM WITH UNSTABLE OIL PRICES AND UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR DEPLOYING SMALL-SCALE OFFSHORE RENEWABLES LIKE SOLAR AND WIND, IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF NETWORKS OF SMALL-SCALE WECS. USING A COMPREHENSIVE MARKET-SIZING APPROACH, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE BUSINESS CASE FOR THESE WEC NETWORKS, WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ENABLE OFFSHORE INDUSTRIES TO BENEFIT FROM AN ""OCEAN INTERNET OF THINGS,"" OR O-IOT. THIS MARKET ANALYSIS REVEALS NOT ONLY THE BLUE ECONOMY INDUSTRIES MOST RIPE FOR ADOPTION, BUT IT ESTABLISHES THE IDEA OF ""INCREASING MARGINAL RETURNS"" FOR THE WAVE ENERGY INDUSTRY STEMMING FROM WIDESPREAD NETWORK EFFECTS, CONTRARY TO THE ""DIMINISHING MARGINAL RETURNS"" DOMINATING MOST INDUSTRIES. NETWORKS OF SMALL-SCALE WECS, WITH AVERAGE POWER OUTPUTS AROUND ONE KILOWATT, WILL LIKELY UNLOCK IMMENSE VALUE IN MATURE, GROWING, AND EMBRYONIC OFFSHORE INDUSTRIES. IN A MATURE INDUSTRY LIKE OIL AND GAS, WECS MAY ENABLE OPERATIONS LIKE REMOTE SENSING AND PIPELINE INSPECTION. IN A GROWING INDUSTRY LIKE AQUACULTURE, WECS MAY ENABLE OPERATIONS LIKE FEEDING AND FISH STOCK MONITORING. IN AN EMBRYONIC INDUSTRY LIKE CORAL REEF RESTORATION, WECS MAY EVEN ENABLE OPERATIONS LIKE SEAWATER ELECTROLYSIS FOR MINERAL ACCRETION. WHILE THE BLUE ECONOMY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE OUTPACING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THROUGH 2030, THIS PAPER CONCLUDES THAT ROBUST NETWORKS OF SMALL-SCALE WECS MAY ENABLE THIS GROWTH EVEN FURTHER.

POORLY PLANNED AND REGULATED TOURISM ACTIVITIES ON LAND AND SEA HAVE LED TO DEGRADATION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE MARINE AREAS, ENCROACHMENT ON PUBLIC BEACHES, EROSION OF THE SHORELINE AND BLOCKAGE OF PUBLIC ACCESS POINTS TO THE BEACHES. THESE IMPACTS TRANSCEND THE LAND AND OCEAN CONTINUUM NECESSITATING THE NEED FOR REGULATION. SPATIAL PLANNING IS ONE OF THE KEY TOOLS THAT PROVIDES A PRE-EMPTIVE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATING TOURISM USES SO AS TO PREVENT HARMFUL DEVELOPMENT AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF POTENTIALLY POLLUTING ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, SPATIAL PLANNING AS APPLIED IN KENYA HAS FOCUSED ON THE REGULATION OF PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENTS ON LAND SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS BUT NOT ON THE RELATED TOURISM ACTIVITIES THAT EMANATE FROM SUCH DEVELOPMENTS. IN THIS CASE, ACTIVITIES THAT TOURISTS ENGAGE IN OUTSIDE OF THE PHYSICAL HOTEL STRUCTURE SUCH AS SWIMMING, LEISURE WALKS, SPORT FISHING, SOUVENIR COLLECTION, AND SNORKELING ARE NOT THE SUBJECT OF SPATIAL PLANNING LEADING TO UNSUSTAINABLE USE WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE. THIS STUDY MAKES A CASE FOR ADOPTING AN INTEGRATED SPATIAL PLANNING APPROACH AS A LEVER FOR REGULATING TOURISM ACTIVITIES WITHIN THIS EXPANDED LENS, BEYOND JUST THE BUILDINGS AND ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE HOTEL ESTABLISHMENTS.

THIRD, THE SECURITISATION PROCESS IS NOT UNIFORM SPATIALLY, A CONDITION CIRCUMSCRIBING THE NUMBER OF GLOBAL MARITIME PUBLIC SECURITY GOODS REQUIRING COLLECTIVE ACTION. THE BLUE ECONOMY CONSTITUTES A FOURTH COMPLICATION: SOME LITTORAL STATES TREAT THE “BLUE ECONOMY” AS A PROBLEM OF MANAGING COMMON-POOL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE THE EXTRACTION OF OCEAN RESOURCES WITHOUT DEPLETING THOSE (RENEWABLE) RESOURCES, WHEREAS FOR OTHERS, THE OVER-EXPLOITATION OR FOULING OF THE “BLUE ECONOMY” REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY.

DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT IN BANGLADESH: VULNERABILITY AND RESIL.,"THE RAPID GROWTH OF COMMERCIAL SHRIMP FARMING IN COASTAL ZONE, OFTEN DESCRIBED AS BLUE REVOLUTION, HAS SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN BANGLADESH. WHILE AVAILABLE STUDIES DEAL WITH VARIOUS IMPACTS OF SHRIMP FARMING ON COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT, THERE IS A LACK OF ANALYSIS ABOUT THE DRIVERS OF BLUE REVOLUTION. TO FILL THIS GAP, THIS CHAPTER EXAMINES SOCIOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DRIVERS OF BLUE REVOLUTION IN COASTAL BANGLADESH. IT PARTICULARLY FOCUSES ON HOW STATE POLICIES HAVE PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT IMPETUS TO THE RISE IN PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OF SHRIMP IN GLOBAL MARKETS. WE ALSO SYNTHESIZE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE ON THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF SHRIMP AQUACULTURE ON VULNERABLE COASTAL COMMUNITIES. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE RISE IN REVENUE FROM SHRIMP FARMING HAS RESULTED IN EXPLOITATION, INJUSTICE, AND DEGRADATION OF THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT THAT HAVE INTENSIFIED THE EXISTING VULNERABILITY OF MANY DISASTER-STRESSED COASTAL POPULATION. GIVEN THESE FAR-REACHING EFFECTS, WE CALL FOR BUILDING AN INCLUSIVE POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR THE EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE OF SHRIMP AQUACULTURE THAT WILL PROMOTE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE BLUE ECONOMY. © 2023 SELECTION AND EDITORIAL MATTER, MAHBUBA NASREEN, KHONDOKER MOKADDEM HOSSAIN AND MOHAMMED MONIRUZZAMAN KHAN; INDIVIDUAL CHAPTERS, THE CONTRIBUTORS.

WE VALIDATED THIS CIRCULAR APPROACH WITH TWO ITERATIONS OF MAPATHONS AND HACKATHONS, AND FOUND THAT 1) THE SIZE AND LOCATION OF THE MAP AREA NEED TO BE CAREFULLY CHOSEN; 2) THOSE CREATING THE APPS NEEDED A HUGE AMOUNT OF HELP IN DEALING WITH THE GEOSPATIAL DATA; AND 3) ANY GEOSPATIAL DATA IS USEFUL FOR THE BLUE ECONOMY, NOT ONLY DATA WITH A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE IN THE BLUE ECONOMY CONTEXT, SUCH AS COASTAL ACCESS POINTS.

THE BLUE GROWTH, A KNOWLEDGE DRIVEN EXPLOITATION OF THE MARINE RESOURCES, IS A TARGET THAT EU AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE SET TO IMPROVE THE SOCIETAL WELLBEING. IN PARTICULAR THE MEDITERRANEAN HAS STILL UNEXPLOITED POTENTIALS TO PROVIDE VERY SPECIFIC ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. TO THIS AIM, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FUNDED THE BLUEMED PROJECT (2016-2020), WHICH INVOLVES NINE DIFFERENT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (CROATIA, CYPRUS, FRANCE, GREECE, ITALY, MALTA, PORTUGAL, SLOVENIA, SPAIN) AND THEIR RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEFINITION OF SHARED STRATEGIES AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL; THE ITALIAN NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (CNR) COORDINATES BLUEMED. GIVEN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE PRESENT PAPER, STARTS FROM THE MAIN OUTCOMES OF BLUEMED ON RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, THROUGH A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RELEVANT ACTIVITIES AND THEMATIC OBJECTIVES FOR SOME OF THE MAIN MARINE AND MARITIME SOCIO-ECONOMIC DRIVERS (TRANSPORT, TOURISM, ENERGY HAVE BEEN CHOSEN). THEN, ON THAT BASIS AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF A DEEP LITERATURE OVERVIEW, IT TRIES TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT STATUS OF SOME RELEVANT SECTORS FOR THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION ON THIS MARITIME AREA, HIGHLIGHTING THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO THE FULFILMENT OF THE PLANNED PRIORITIES AND PROPOSING POSSIBLE STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THEM; ALL THIS STARTING FROM AN ITALIAN PERSPECTIVE. THE EMPHASIS IS PUT JUST ON THE GAPS AND BARRIERS TO BLUE GROWTH, AND ON THE WAYS TO OVERCOME THEM, TO HELP THE IDENTIFICATION OF CROSS-CUTTING HIGH-LEVEL PRIORITIES AND ACTIONS FOR RESEARCH AND INNOVATION, TO BE SHARED AT NATIONAL AND MEDITERRANEAN LEVEL. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THE WORK PRESENTED HERE IS THE RECOGNITION THAT CONCRETE STEPS TOWARDS A “BLUE” ECONOMY CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY BY GOING BEYOND THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES FOR SPECIFIC SECTORS, SINCE THEY NECESSARILY REFLECT A PARTIAL, SECTORIAL VIEW, AND THAT THE MAIN EFFORT MUST BE DIRECTED TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED VIEW OF HOW DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES, OFTEN CONFLICTING, MIGHT COEXISTS. ANOTHER FINDING IS THE PLANNING OF ROADMAPS TO FOLLOW SO THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES/KNOWLEDGE COULD OVERCOME THOSE CONFLICTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE AIM AND THE OUTPUT OF THE PAPER IS NOT PROPOSING A FURTHER DETAILED LIST OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PRIORITIES, BUT IS INSTEAD TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW THE MOST RELEVANT R&I CHALLENGES FOR BLUE GROWTH ALREADY AVAILABLE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENTLY PURSUED FOLLOWING THE ROADMAPS PROPOSED IN THE PAPER.

A REVIEW OF LITERATURE ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BSR HAS SHOWN THAT A MORE ACTIVE USE OF THE UNIQUE RESOURCES OF COASTAL TERRITORIES ALONG WITH A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN GROWTH OF THE BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS CAN COUNTERBALANCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TERRITORIES ON THE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SDGS IN THE BSR. INCREASING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE BSR COASTAL TERRITORIES REQUIRES INVESTMENT IN DIGITAL SOLUTIONS IN THE BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS AND BUILDING COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE.

CONV., SMC","MOVING WATER HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY DENSITIES, YET A MAJOR UNTAPPED AND UNDERUTILIZED AREA OF ENERGY PRODUCTION IS WAVE ENERGY. WITH THE RECENT INTEREST IN THE BLUE ECONOMY, THIS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE. POINT WAVE ENERGY CONVERTER (PWEC) ABSORBS THE WAVE ENERGY AT A SINGLE POINT AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE BUOY SURFACE COMPONENT AND A LONGER SUBSURFACE COMPONENT THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE SEABED. THE MOTION OF THE TOP BUOY IS USED TO PUMP FLUID OR DRIVE A LINEAR GENERATOR, WHICH IN TURN PROVIDES POWER. THIS PAPER NUMERICALLY INVESTIGATES DIFFERENT SHAPED SURFACE BUOYS, WITH A FOCUS ON THE POWER-GENERATING ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM, FOR A SINGLE POINT WEC USING A NON-LINEAR FREE SURFACE APPROXIMATION. THREE-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATIONS OF THE BUOYS IN VARIOUS SEA STATES WERE MODELED IN OPENFOAM USING UNSTEADY REYNOLDS-AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES (URANS) EQUATIONS WITH FINITE VOLUME METHOD (FVM). THE DYNAMIC MESH MODULE WAS INTEGRATED WITH THE TWO-PHASE SOLVER, AND THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE WEC WAS MODELED WITH A FORCED OSCILLATOR MECHANISM. BY STUDYING THE DISPLACEMENTS, FREQUENCY RESPONSES, AND DESIGN PARAMETERS, THE OPTIMAL BUOY SHAPE FOR MAXIMIZING ENERGY OUTPUT WAS DETERMINED. FURTHER, THE GUIDANCE REGARDING THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE GEOMETRY, REPRESENTED BY THE LENGTH TO DIAMETER RATIO OF THE SHAPE, IS DISCUSSED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SPHEROID BUOY SHAPE WITH A LOW LENGTH TO DIAMETER RATIO IS A GOOD CANDIDATE SHAPE TO EXTRACT WAVE ENERGY SINCE IT HAS A LARGE WATERPLANE AREA. © 2021 SOCIETY OF NAVAL ARCHITECTS AND MARINE ENGINEERS (SNAME)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SNAME MARITIME CONVENTION 2021, SMC 2021",ENGLISH,4,NA,NA,NA,FINAL,SOCIETY OF NAVAL ARCHITECTS AND MARINE ENGINEERS,SCOPUS,NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE EFFECT OF BUOY GEOMETRIES ON PTO OF WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS,CONFERENCE PAPER,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118437623&doi=10.5957%2fSMC-2021-131&partnerID=40&md5=90293c95d0bb461ddb7fc5e46a38b970,NA,2021,"SNAME MARIT CONV, SMC",none,TEXAS AANDM UNIVERSITY,TEXAS AANDM UNIVERSITY,NA,"HAMADA AA, 2021, SNAME MARIT CONV, SMC","HAMADA AA, 2021, SNAME MARIT CONV, SMC"

THE RECENT INTEREST IN THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS LED THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO INCREASE INVESTIGATIONS IN SUSTAINABLE OCEANIC ENERGY OPTIONS, SUCH AS POINT WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS (WEC). THESE DEVICES HARVEST THE WAVE ENERGY USING THE EXCITED OSCILLATORY MOTION OF THE BUOY, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO A POWER TAKE-OFF SYSTEM (PTO). DURING THE LAST DECADES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE DEVICES HAS BEEN BOOSTED BUT THEY ARE STILL BEHIND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. THE FURTHLAB AT TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HAS SHOWED THAT THE SPHEROID BUOY SHAPE WITH A LOW LENGTH TO DIAMETER RATIO IS A GOOD CANDIDATE SHAPE TO EXTRACT WAVE ENERGY, BY TESTING DIFFERENT BUOY SHAPES AND ASPECT RATIOS AT A NON-LINEAR STOKES-II WAVE GENERATION. THIS PAPER IS THE NEXT STEP IN OUR RESEARCH AND NUMERICALLY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF CHANGING THE WAVE CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS AMPLITUDE, FREQUENCY, AND SPEED, ON THE POWER-GENERATING ABILITY OF THE SPHEROID BUOY SYSTEM. THREE-DIMENSIONAL UNSTEADY REYNOLDS-AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES (URANS) SIMULATIONS OF THE SELECTED BUOY WERE PERFORMED IN OPENFOAM WITH THE INTEGRATION OF A DYNAMIC MESH MODULE TO HANDLE THE HEAVE MOTION OF THE BUOY. IN ADDITION, THE PTO SYSTEM WAS COMPENSATED WITH A FORCED OSCILLATOR MECHANISM OF SPRING AND DAMPER. A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE BUOY’S DISPLACEMENT AND FREQUENCY RESPONSES, AND POWER EFFICIENCY SHOWED THE OPTIMAL OPERATING SEA STATE TO MAXIMIZE ENERGY OUTPUT USING THE SPHEROID WEC. THE RESULTS CONCLUDE THAT THE BEST WAVE CONDITIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE POWER EXTRACTION EFFICIENCY USING A SPHEROID BUOY WITH A DIAMETER OF 1 M AND LENGTH OF 0.5 M ARE WAVE LENGTH GREATER THAN 4 M, WAVE HEIGHT LESS THAN 0.15 M, AND WAVE SPEED BETWEEN 0.07 AND 0.12 M/S.
