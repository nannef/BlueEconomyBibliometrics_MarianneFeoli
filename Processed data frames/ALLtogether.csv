PACIFIC ISLAND GOVERNMENTS, REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS, AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ALL USE THE TERMS, WHICH ORIGINATE OUTSIDE OF THE PACIFIC.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS FINDINGS FROM RESEARCH ON THE VERNACULARISATION OF GREEN GROWTH TERMINOLOGY IN FIJI AND VANUATU. WE FIND A CONTESTED POLICY SPACE, WHERE PACIFIC ACTORS DEPLOY COMPETING MEANINGS OF GREEN GROWTH TERMS IN WAYS THAT BOTH REFLECT THEIR WORLDVIEWS AND SUPPORT THEIR AGENDAS.

THESE CONCEPTIONS WERE GROUNDED IN OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SURFACE OR SHORELINE, AND IN PERIODS WHEN HUMAN ACTIVITIES IN THE OCEAN WERE MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY AND SPATIALLY LIMITED THAN THEY ARE TODAY. ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED HOW HUMANS INTERACT WITH AND ACCESS THE OCEAN, ALLOWING EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION OF OCEAN AREAS AND PROCESSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. THIS NEW CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND AND EXTRACT FROM THE OCEAN MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO PROFOUNDLY ALTER HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS TO IT AND CONCEPTIONS OF IT. AS PUBLIC SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT WITH MARINE CONSERVATION AND ‘BLUE ECONOMIES’ STEM FROM VALUE AND BELIEF SYSTEMS, FUTURE MARINE MANAGEMENT WILL BENEFIT FROM RECOGNIZING OUR HISTORICAL MARINE RELATIONSHIPS AS CONTEXT FOR CHANGES IN UNDERSTANDING, USE, AND THE INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION FACED BY THE OCEAN.

NAT.,"DUE TO THE STRONG INTERCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN THE OCEAN AND OUR SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, IMPROVED OCEAN GOVERNANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UN OCEAN DECADE. HOWEVER, A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES—ECOLOGICAL, SOCIETAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC—AND RELATIONS BETWEEN THESE HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION TO FOSTER TRANSFORMATIVE PATHWAYS TOWARDS MARINE SUSTAINABILITY. A CORE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE FACING IS THAT THE ‘RIGHT’ RESPONSE TO COMPLEX SOCIETAL ISSUES CANNOT BE KNOWN BEFOREHAND AS ABILITIES TO PREDICT COMPLEX SYSTEMS ARE LIMITED. CONSEQUENTLY, SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION IS NECESSARILY A JOURNEY TOWARDS THE UNKNOWN AND THEREFORE REQUIRES EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES THAT MUST ENABLE THE INVOLVEMENT OF EVERYONE WITH STAKES IN THE FUTURE OF OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND ITS RESOURCES. A PROMISING TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH METHOD THAT FULFILS BOTH CRITERIA—BEING PARTICIPATORY AND EXPERIMENTAL—ARE REAL-WORLD LABORATORIES. HERE, WE DISCUSS HOW REAL-WORLD LABS CAN SERVE AS AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OCEAN DECADE BY FACILITATING AND GUIDING SUCCESSFUL KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE AT THE INTERFACE OF SCIENCE AND SOCIETY. THE CORE ELEMENT OF REAL-WORLD LABS IS TRANSDISCIPLINARY EXPERIMENTATION TO JOINTLY DEVELOP POTENTIAL STRATEGIES LEADING TO TARGETED REAL-WORLD INTERVENTIONS, ESSENTIAL FOR ACHIEVING THE PROPOSED ‘DECADE OUTCOMES’. THE AUTHORS SPECIFICALLY ILLUSTRATE HOW DEPLOYING THE CONCEPT OF REAL-WORLD LABS CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS WHEN HAVING TO DEAL WITH MULTIPLE, OVERLAPPING CHALLENGES IN THE CONTEXT OF OCEAN GOVERNANCE AND THE BLUE ECONOMY. ALTOGETHER, WE OFFER A FIRST MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO SYNTHESIZING KNOWLEDGE ON THE POTENTIALS OF MARINE REAL-WORLD LABS, CONSIDERING HOW THEY ACT AS A WAY OF EXPLORING OPTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE OCEAN FUTURES. INDEED, IN THE MARINE CONTEXT, REAL-WORLD LABS ARE STILL UNDER-EXPLORED BUT ARE A TANGIBLE WAY FOR ADDRESSING THE SOCIETAL CHALLENGES OF WORKING TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY TRANSFORMATIONS OVER THE COMING UN OCEAN DECADE AND BEYOND.

IN 2017, IT ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY € 74.3 BILLION IN GROSS OPERATING PROFIT, AND AN ANNUAL TURNOVER OF APPROXIMATELY € 658 BILLION. AMONG ALL BLUE ECONOMIC SECTORS, CRUISE TOURISM IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES, WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION STILL ACCOUNTING FOR THE SECOND MOST POPULAR CRUISE DESTINATION IN THE WORLD, AFTER THE CARIBBEAN. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE CRUISE SECTOR TO THE LOCAL ECONOMIES OF MOST PORTS OF CALL HOWEVER, PROVES TO BE QUITE LIMITED, WITH NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OFTEN SURPASSING DERIVED BENEFITS. PROMOTING AND INTEGRATING ‘TRADITIONAL’ PRODUCTS INTO CRUISE SUPPLY CHAINS CAN BE A PROMISING SOLUTION ADDRESSING THIS SITUATION. IT MAY ALSO PROVIDE PASSENGERS WITH AN ENHANCED LOCAL-TASTING EXPERIENCE THAT MAY MAKE THEIR JOURNEY EVEN MORE MEMORABLE.

WITH THE INCREASE IN THE SCALE OF OCEANIC FISHING, THERE WAS A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO STUDY AND PRESERVE THE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE OCEANS. THIS WAS FACILITATED BY A NUMBER OF OBJECTIVE FACTORS AND, ABOVE ALL, THE DESIRE OF ALL STATES INVOLVED IN THE EXPLOITATION OF AQUATIC BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE, MAXIMUM POSSIBLE, RATIONAL USE OF THESE RESOURCES. IN ORDER TO PRESERVE LIVING MARINE RESOURCES FOR MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD OCEAN, INCLUDING IN THE ATLANTIC, INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED AND SIGNED. AS A RESULT, INTERNATIONAL FISHING ORGANIZATIONS WERE CREATED FOR ALMOST EVERY DISTRICT: FISHING COMMISSIONS, SCIENTIFIC COUNCILS, SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEES, ETC. THE MAIN TASK FOR OUR COUNTRY IN THE RESEARCH AND EXTRACTION OF AQUATIC BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN MODERN CONDITIONS IS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF OPTIMAL RUSSIAN FISHING AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

INDIA, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 7.56% OF GLOBAL PRODUCTION, IS THE SECOND-LARGEST PRODUCER OF MARINE FOODS. THIS INDUSTRY ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 1.24% OF INDIA’S GROSS VALUE ADDED (GVA). SEAFOOD (FISH, PRAWNS, ETC.) CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A VITAL SOURCE OF HEALTHY AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD, REVENUE, AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY IN INDIA. THE SECTOR EMPLOYS AROUND 28 MILLION PEOPLE AT THE PRIMARY LEVEL AND OVER 50 MILLION INDIVIDUALS ALONG THE VALUE CHAIN. OVER THE PREVIOUS 3 YEARS, THE YEARLY AVERAGE GROWTH RATE IN THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN 7%. SEAFOOD IS ONE OF THE BEST ALTERNATIVES FOR REDUCING HUNGER AND NUTRIENT SHORTAGE SINCE IT IS A LOW-COST, HIGH-PROTEIN SOURCE. THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES IN CULTURE FISHERIES ARE LOW AVERAGE PRODUCTION BECAUSE OF POOR TECHNOLOGICAL ADOPTION, ILLNESS PREVALENCE, AND A LACK OF HIGH-QUALITY SEED AND AFFORDABLE FEED FOR TARGETED SPECIES. BETTER GOVERNANCE, AQUACULTURE FARMING, SEAFOOD, POLICY SUPPORT, AND CAPACITY BUILDING ARE ALL CRITICAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE COUNTRY’S BLUE ECONOMY AMBITIONS.

IN THIS STUDY, THE CONCEPT OF COUNTRY'S BLUE ECONOMY STATUS WAS TRANSFORMED INTO AN OPERATIONAL DEFINITION THROUGH COMPLEX NETWORK METHOD. CONSIDERING THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNAVOIDABLE SPATIAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN COUNTRIES IN BLUE PRODUCT TRADE, THE DOUBLE-FIXED SPATIAL DURBIN MODEL WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DIRECT EFFECT OF BLUE PRODUCT STRUCTURE ON THE PROMOTION OF COUNTRY'S BLUE ECONOMY STATUS AND THE SPATIAL SPILLOVER EFFECT ON SURROUNDING COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT: (1) THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES' BLUE ECONOMY STATUS, MEANING THAT COUNTRIES ARE NOT RANDOMLY INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY OTHER REGIONS.

PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, POTENTIAL INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS FROM SELECTED SEAWEEDS COULD RESULT IN NOVEL ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND INCOME GENERATION AS KEY ELEMENTS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGIES IN THE REGION. THIS REVIEW PRESENTS THE SEAWEED RESOURCES FROM THE MACARONESIA REGION, WHICH COLLECTIVELY INCLUDES 52 TAXA, OF WHICH—9 GREENS, 14 BROWNS, AND 29 REDS ARE CATALOGED. SOME GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, E.G., THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS AND MADEIRA, REQUIRE MORE INTENSE FIELD RESEARCH IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE SELECTED, TARGET SEAWEEDS OF INTEREST WHICH MAY BECOME NEW MARINE RESOURCES FOR COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION.

MARINE MACROALGAE ARE POTENTIALLY SUSTAINABLE FEEDSTOCK FOR FUTURE FOOD, MATERIALS, CHEMICALS, AND FUELS. FOR SEAWEED BIOREFINERY, THE FRACTIONATION OF THE BIOMASS TO CO-PRODUCE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS IS CRUCIAL IN THE EFFICIENT VALORIZATION OF THE MARINE BIOMASS. IN THIS WORK, WE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL FOR CO-PRODUCTION OF SIX DIFFERENT PRODUCTS FROM THE GREEN MACROALGA ULVA OHNOI USING GREEN EXTRACTION METHODS. A TOTAL OF 90.31 ± 1.94% OF THE INITIAL BIOMASS WAS RECOVERED IN SEPARATED PRODUCTS. THE FRACTION OF THE RECOVERED PRODUCTS FROM INITIAL DRY WEIGHT BIOMASS WAS 45.42 ± 1.91% SALTS, 3.67 ± 1.38% STARCH, 3.81 ± 1.26% LIPIDS, 13.88 ± 0.40% ULVAN, 14.83 ± 1.06% PROTEINS, AND 8.70 ± 1.87% CELLULOSE.

BIOMASS OF MARINE ORIGIN, AND ESPECIALLY SEAWEED, IS A KEY ELEMENT FOR BLUE GROWTH AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROWING EUROPEAN BLUE ECONOMY. SEVERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROJECTS RESULT IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EMERGING SEAWEED AQUACULTURE IN THE NORTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, MACROALGAL CULTIVATION AND BIOPROCESSING IS STILL SCARCE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AREA, PARTICULARLY IN TUNISIA, WHERE SEAWEEDS ARE ABUNDANT ON ITS COAST, THEY REMAIN LITTLE EXPLOITED. ONGOING PROJECTS FROM DIFFERENT RESEARCH INSTITUTES FOCUS ON BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF MACROALGAE, THE EXTRACTION OF ACTIVE COMPOUNDS, AND THE POTENTIAL USES AS PHYCOCOLLOIDS, PIGMENTS, LIPIDS, AND BIOACTIVE METABOLITES CHARACTERIZATION AS WELL AS BIOPRODUCT ENHANCEMENT. THE RESULTS OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT MACROALGAE FROM THE TUNISIAN COASTS ARE A SOURCE OF VALUABLE COMPOUNDS AND THAT THEY CAN BE USED AS A NATURAL RENEWABLE RESOURCE SUITABLE FOR A LARGE ARRAY OF INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.

THIS SECTOR NOT ONLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE RENEWABLE FEEDSTOCK BUT ITS CULTIVATION AND PROCESSING TICKS AN IMPORTANT BOX FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. SEAWEED CULTIVATION IN INDIA IS GAINING MOMENTUM AND GREAT ATTENTION IS BEING GIVEN TO DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. A FLAGSHIP PROGRAM ‘PRADHAN MANTRI MATSYA SAMPADA YOJANA (PMMSY)’ HAS PROVIDED ADEQUATE BUDGETARY ALLOCATION TO ACHIEVE A PRODUCTION OF 11.2 MT (FRESH) FEEDSTOCK. HOWEVER, THE SCHEME SEEMS TO FOCUS ONLY ON MATERIAL BENEFITS (PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT) AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, ESPECIALLY REGULATORY SERVICES HAVE SELDOM BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THUS, THE PRESENT ARTICLE TRIES TO ADDRESS THE ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL REGULATORY ECOSYSTEM SERVICES [CAPTURE CARBON, UPTAKE NUTRIENTS AND HEAVY METALS (CR, CO, CD)] MET THROUGH KAPPAPHYCUS ALVAREZII FARMING, AT THE PAN-INDIA LEVEL. THE ESTIMATES WERE MADE FOR BOTH TUBE NET AND RAFT CULTIVATION METHODS SEPARATELY. THE FARM COVER WAS ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND 700,000 HA SUPPORTING APPROXIMATELY 780,000 FARMERS FOR TUBE NET, WHILE IT WAS 56,000 HA SUPPORTING ~ 1.25 MILLION FARMERS FOR RAFT CULTIVATION. A TOTAL NUMBER OF TUBE NETS THAT WOULD BE PUT TO USE WOULD BE 140 MILLION AND 56 MILLION IN THE CASE OF RAFTS. ONCE THE TARGET IS ACHIEVED INDIA WOULD HAVE GAINED THE ABILITY TO ANNUALLY CAPTURE APPROXIMATELY 600,000 T OF CARBON, 22,000 T OF NITROGEN, AND 2000 T OF PHOSPHOROUS AND ABSORB MORE THAN 1000 T OF HEAVY METALS CUMULATIVELY.

WITH LIMITED SPACE AND DEGRADED RESOURCES IN COASTAL AREAS, OFFSHORE WATERS WILL BE A PARTICULAR FOCUS OF BLUE ECONOMY EXPANSION OVER THE NEXT DECADE. WHEN EMERGING AND ESTABLISHED ECONOMIC SECTORS EXPAND IN OFFSHORE WATERS (WITHIN NATIONAL EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES), DIFFERENT POTENTIAL BLUE ECONOMY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES WILL ARISE. FOLLOWING A SERIES OF INTERDISCIPLINARY WORKSHOPS, WE IMAGINE TWO TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE FUTURES FOR THE OFFSHORE BLUE ECONOMY AND WE IDENTIFY THE ACTIONS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE MORE SUSTAINABLE OUTCOME. UNDER A BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO THE FOCUS WILL REMAIN ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE COMMODIFICATION OF NATURE, THE DOMINANCE OF PRIVATE OVER PUBLIC AND CULTURAL INTERESTS, AND PRIORITISATION OF THE INTERESTS OF CURRENT OVER FUTURE GENERATIONS. A MORE SUSTAINABLE SCENARIO WOULD MEET MULTIPLE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND ENSURE INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND FAIR AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS USERS, NATIONS, AND GENERATIONS. CHALLENGES TO THIS MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE ARE A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT EMERGING OFFSHORE SECTORS, LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES, AND A LACK OF PLANNING AND GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT. ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES WILL REQUIRE A SHIFT IN SOCIETAL VALUES, A MORE BALANCED ALLOCATION OF FUNDING TO OFFSHORE ACTIVITIES, TRANSPARENCY IN INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN INDUSTRIES AND ACROSS NATIONS, AND ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS. THE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE OFFSHORE BLUE ECONOMY WE ENVISAGE IS ACHIEVABLE AND PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD GLOBAL CAPACITY AND PARTNERSHIP.

USING AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES, GREY LITERATURE, OBSERVATION STUDIES, AND AUTHORS’ INSIDER KNOWLEDGE, WE SUMMARIZE THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE ON BILLFISH FISHERIES IN 10 COUNTRIES. TO DESCRIBE HISTORICAL AND CURRENT TRENDS, WE EXAMINED FISHERIES STATISTICS FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, SPORTFISHING CLUBS’ REPORTS, DIARIES OF SPORTFISHING CAPTAINS, AND THE CATCH AND EFFORT DATABASES OF THE INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION. WE HIGHLIGHT TWO KEY POINTS. FIRST, BILLFISH FISHERIES IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN ARE HIGHLY DIVERSE, COMPRISING TWO DISTINCT SEGMENTS—COASTAL AND OCEANIC. HOWEVER, DATA ARE POOR FOR MOST COUNTRIES WITH SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN INFORMATION ESPECIALLY FOR SPORT AND ARTISANAL FISHERIES. SECOND, THE EVIDENCE ASSEMBLED SHOWED THAT BILLFISH SPECIES HAVE IMMENSE SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC VALUE. SWORDFISH ARE TARGETED BY BOTH LARGE-SCALE AND SEMI-INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES, WHILE OTHER BILLFISH SPECIES, PARTICULARLY MARLIN, ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER BY SPORT FISHERIES IN MOST COUNTRIES.

FISH, RICH IN MICRONUTRIENTS, HAVE POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING THE NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF COASTAL AND RIPARIAN COMMUNITIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH WHERE INADEQUATE NUTRITION IS PREVALENT. YET, THE POTENTIAL FOR FISH TO ALLEVIATE MALNUTRITION REMAINS LIMITED TO POLICY DOCUMENTS AND HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT COMMITMENTS.

PLASTICS IN THE OCEAN DAMAGE BIODIVERSITY AND MARINE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT THE BLUE ECONOMY RELIES UPON. THE PRESENT WORK ANALYSES AND REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON PLASTIC POLLUTION AND THE BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION IN MOROCCO. THE ECONOMY OF MOROCCO DEPENDS MAINLY ON MARINE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FISHERIES, TOURISM, AND MARITIME TRADE. THESE SECTORS WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MAIN IN-SITU SOURCES OF PLASTICS ENTERING MOROCCAN COASTAL WATERS. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INCREASING ABUNDANCE OF PLASTICS IN SUCH MARINE SYSTEMS CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC LOSS TO BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES. IN CONTRAST, THE LACK OF DATA ON THE PLASTIC WASTE QUANTITY ENTERING MOROCCAN WATER IS A LIMITING FACTOR FOR ASSESSING PLASTIC POLLUTION. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A RISK ASSESSMENT AND MORE FIELD INVESTIGATIONS TO VALUE THE WEIGHT IMPACTS OF MARINE ACTIVITIES GENERATORS OF PLASTICS ON BIODIVERSITY AND THE ECONOMY. IN ADDITION, IMPLEMENTING LAWS AND RULES FORBIDDING THE DISPOSAL OF PLASTIC WASTE (PW) IN PUBLIC SPACES, MAINLY BEACHES, AND STREETS, IS URGENTLY NEEDED. RAISING AWARENESS OF PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT AND PRIORITIZING IMPROVED WASTE COLLECTION, SORTING, AND MANAGEMENT WOULD BOOST MOROCCO’S ESTABLISHMENT AND ADOPTION OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY STRATEGIES.

HOWEVER, THE FISHERY IS ALSO AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PARADOX BEHIND THE IDEA OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, WHERE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF RESOURCES ARE PROMOTED AS JOINTLY ACHIEVABLE. WE SHOW THAT A SUSTAINABILITY NARRATIVE, IN WHICH THE IDEA OF FISHING WITHIN ECOLOGICAL LIMITS IS PRESENT WITHIN GOVERNMENT POLICY, PUBLIC DISCOURSE, AND PRACTICES, IS, HOWEVER, IN CONTRADICTION WITH THE REALITIES OF ACCUMULATION AND GROWTH THAT PREVAIL IN THE FISHERY.

MAJOR COMMERCIAL PORTS ARE FULLY INTEGRATED INTO TRANSNATIONAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, ENABLING THE CIRCULATION OF MASSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY AND MATERIALS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. PORT ACTIVITY AND DEVELOPMENT ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS, SUCH AS INCREASED GDP AND EMPLOYMENT, BUT THE INDUSTRY’S CONTINUOUS EXPANSION PRODUCES ADVERSE OUTCOMES INCLUDING AIR AND WATER POLLUTION, THE DESTRUCTION OF MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS, WATERFRONT CONGESTION, HEALTH RISKS, AND LABOR ISSUES. IN ITS QUEST TO MARRY ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRIES, PROPONENTS OF THE NEWLY COINED BLUE GROWTH PARADIGM ASSUME THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF PORTS AND SHIPPING TO BE FIXABLE MOSTLY THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. THIS PAPER QUESTIONS THE VALIDITY OF THE PREMISE THAT THE UNLIMITED GROWTH OF THE PORT AND SHIPPING INDUSTRIES IS COMPATIBLE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND ANALYSES THE FEASIBILITY OF TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO OFFSET THE SECTOR’S ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE IMPACTS. BASED ON INSIGHTS FROM ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL ECOLOGY, PORTS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS POWER-LADEN ASSEMBLAGES OF SPACES, FLOWS, AND ACTORS, WHICH PRODUCE UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS AND BURDENS AT MULTIPLE SCALES. FOCUSING ON THE CASE OF THE PORT OF BARCELONA, THIS STUDY ARGUES THAT THE CONTINUOUS EXPANSION OF PORT ACTIVITY INCREASES SELDOM ACCOUNTED-FOR NEGATIVE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, ACQUIRING AN UNECONOMIC CHARACTER FOR PORT CITIES AND REGIONS.

REFRAMING IT AS A ‘BLUE FIX’, WE ARGUE THAT THE BLUE GROWTH DISCOURSE FACILITATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAPITAL ACCUMULATION, WHILE CLAIMING THAT THIS ACCUMULATION IS COMPATIBLE WITH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL AIMS AS WELL. THE BLUE FIX IS MADE UP OF THREE UNDERLYING SUB-FIXES. FIRST OF ALL, THE CONSERVATION FIX QUENCHES THE SOCIAL THIRST FOR ACTION IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HERE WE SEE HOW PROTECTING MARINE AREAS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT IN PRACTICE, GAINS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARE OVERSHADOWED BY THE ONGOING EXPANSION OF OFFSHORE DRILLING FOR OIL AND GAS. SECOND, THE PROTEIN FIX SATISFIES THE GROWING GLOBAL DEMAND FOR HEALTHY FOOD AND NUTRITION THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF CAPITAL-INTENSIVE LARGE-SCALE AQUACULTURE, WHILE IGNORING THE NEGATIVE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS, WHICH EFFECTIVELY SQUEEZE SMALL-SCALE CAPTURE FISHING OUT, WHILE INDUSTRIAL CAPTURE FISHING REMAINS WELL POSITIONED TO EXPAND INTO AS WELL AS SUPPLY INDUSTRIAL AQUACULTURE WITH FISH FEED FROM PELAGIC FISH. AND THIRD, AN ENERGY FIX OFFERS A BURST OF WIND ENERGY AND A SPLASH OF NEW DEEP-SEA MINERALS WITHOUT DISTURBING THE FAMILIAR AND PERSISTENT FOUNDATION OF OIL AND GAS. THIS DIMENSION OF THE BLUE FIX EMPHASIZES THE TRANSITION TO WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY, BUT MEANWHILE THE DEEP SEA MINING FOR MINERALS REQUIRED BY THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES LAUNCHES US INTO UNKNOWN ECOLOGICAL TERRITORIES WITH LITTLE UNDERSTOOD CONSEQUENCES. THE SYNERGY OF THESE THREE ELEMENTS BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A REFRAMING OF OCEAN POLITICS MANIFESTS AS A BALANCING ACT TO FRAME BLUE GROWTH AS ‘SUSTAINABLE’ AND IN EVERYONE’S INTEREST, WHICH WE CRITICALLY ANALYZE AND DISCUSS IN THIS ARTICLE. © 2020, SPRINGER JAPAN KK, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",NA,"Z.W.

ISLANDS OF THE SAME ARCHIPELAGO HAVE FACED VARIOUS CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF TOURISM GROWTH AND RELATED IMPACT. PRIMARILY, TOURISM HAS BEEN CHARACTERISED BY SEASONALITY (THE STRONG SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONCENTRATION OF TOURISTS IN A DESTINATION) ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST PERIPHERAL ISLANDS. IN OTHER CASES, TOURISM HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY RESULTING IN OVEREMPHASIS ON MASS TOURISM THROUGHOUT PART OF THE YEAR. THIS IS LARGELY EXPERIENCED DUE TO SAND, SUN AND SEA (3S) TOURISM. FIELDWORK, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND ECOTOURS OFF-SEASON, WAS CONDUCTED IN THE AEGADIAN ARCHIPELAGO, OFF THE WEST COAST OF SICILY.

IN RECENT DECADES, SEAPORTS HAVE CORRESPONDINGLY WITNESSED SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION, ALLOWING THEM TO PLAY A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN ACHIEVING BLUE GROWTH. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES FACED BY SMALL-SCALE FISHING ACTORS IN GAINING ACCESS TO FISHING LIVELIHOODS IN COASTAL FISHING COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO GHANAIAN PORTS. DRAWING ON POLITICAL ECOLOGY, THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES HOW SECURITISATION IN PORT AREAS AND DISPOSSESSION HAS RESULTED IN UNSTABLE FISHING LIVELIHOODS IN PORT COMMUNITIES. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE GROWTH-ORIENTED GOALS OF PORT EXPANSIONS AND PORT SECURITY MEASURES HAVE RESTRICTED FISHING COMMUNITIES’ ACCESS TO COASTAL FISHING SPACES AND CAUSED CONGESTION IN THE CANOE BAYS OF GHANA’S FISHING HARBOURS. IN ADDITION, THE URBANISATION AROUND THE PORTS HAS IMPACTED FISHERS’ ABILITY TO MEET THE RISING COST OF LIVING IN FISHING COMMUNITIES WITH FISHING INCOMES. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY DISCUSSES HOW THE NEW JAMESTOWN FISHING HARBOUR COMPLEX PROJECT HAS DISPLACED SMALL-SCALE FISHING ACTORS AND BECOME A SITE OF CONTESTATION BETWEEN A COASTAL FISHING COMMUNITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. IN CONCLUSION, AS COASTAL FISHING ACTORS LOSE THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD, RESISTANCE MAY ESCALATE INTO DIFFERENT FORMS OF MARITIME CONFLICTS IN THE BLUE ECONOMY.

SEAWEED PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE BLUE ECONOMY AS A SOURCE OF FOOD, FEED, AND FEEDSTOCK FOR BIOREFINERIES. TODAY, THE LARGEST PART OF GLOBAL SEAWEED PRODUCTION IS BASED IN ASIA, BUT THERE IS ALSO A GROWING INTEREST IN SEAWEED PRODUCTION IN EUROPE. HOWEVER, MORE KNOWLEDGE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IS NEEDED TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF THE SECTOR. SEAWEED CAN BE USED IN BIOREFINERIES TO PRODUCE A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS FOR FOOD AND NON-FOOD APPLICATIONS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO PERFORM A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) OF A SEAWEED VALUE-CHAIN, INCLUDING SEAWEED CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION INTO SODIUM ALGINATE, BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS, BIOGAS, AND FERTILIZER IN A BIOREFINERY SETTING. THE LCA INCLUDED 19 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES BUT FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE. THE SEAWEED SACCHARINA LATISSIMA WAS CULTIVATED AND PROCESSED IN IRELAND. SODIUM ALGINATE WAS THEN EXTRACTED BY MEANS OF ULTRASOUND-ASSISTED EXTRACTION, A NOVEL EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY. CELLULOSIC RESIDUES PRODUCED AFTER THE EXTRACTION WERE USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FILMS USED AS A PACKAGING MATERIAL. RESIDUES THAT REMAIN AFTER THE PRODUCTION OF THE FILMS WERE SENT TO ANAEROBIC DIGESTION TO ACHIEVE A NO-WASTE CONCEPT. FOR SEAWEED CULTIVATION, FUEL USE AND DRYING OF SEAWEED BIOMASS WERE THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL HOT SPOTS; AND FOR THE ALGINATE EXTRACTION PROCESS, THE YIELD AND PURIFICATION AFTER EXTRACTION WERE THE MAIN HOT SPOTS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER SHOWED THAT THE SEAWEED-BASED BIOREFINERY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE SUSTAINABLE, BUT SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE NECESSARY BEFORE IT IS COMPETITIVE WITH LAND-BASED SYSTEMS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS",NA,"K.

EXPANDING AQUACULTURE COULD CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD SUPPLY AND SECURITY AND PROVIDE A MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY TO PRODUCE FOOD IN THE FUTURE. THE UNITED STATES HAS RECENTLY EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN INCREASING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF SEAFOOD, IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER PROMOTING AMERICAN SEAFOOD COMPETITIVENESS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, WITH THE DIRECT DESIRED RESULTS OF INCREASED LOCAL AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD, DECREASED FOREIGN DEPENDENCE, AND INCREASED JOBS. CALIFORNIA IS RE-EXAMINING ITS SEAFOOD SECTOR AND NEEDS TO RECONCILE DISPARITIES IN PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION AS THE STATE NAVIGATES A CHANGING SEAFOOD LANDSCAPE. UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT SEAFOOD LANDSCAPE IS NECESSARY FOR MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS TO SECURE A RESILIENT, SUSTAINABLE, AND EQUITABLE SEAFOOD SECTOR. TO REFLECT THE GOALS RECENTLY STATED IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER, WE ASK 1) WHAT IS THE STATE OF SEAFOOD PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA, 2) WHAT IS THE TRADE LANDSCAPE FOR SEAFOOD WITHIN CALIFORNIA, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL, AND 3) HOW HAVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED THIS INTERACTION BETWEEN PRODUCTION, TRADE, AND CONSUMPTION, THROUGH THE LENS OF EMPLOYMENT. WE FIND CALIFORNIA CONSUMES UPWARD OF THREE TIMES MORE SEAFOOD THAN IT PRODUCES BY VOLUME, AND RELIES HEAVILY ON INTERNATIONAL IMPORTS TO MAKE UP THE PRODUCTION GAP, WITH ROUGHLY HALF OF IMPORTED PRODUCTION LIKELY COMING FROM AQUACULTURE. THIS RELIANCE HAS RADIATING EFFECTS, SUCH AS DISPLACEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN TO OTHER, OFTEN POORER AND LESS REGULATED COUNTRIES, AND TO PLACES WHERE SEAFOOD PRODUCTION IS LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WILD CAPTURE IS UNLIKELY TO INCREASE, SO ANY INCREASE IN DOMESTIC PRODUCTION WILL COME FROM AQUACULTURE. TO MEET THIS CALL, CALIFORNIA HAS A CHOICE ALONG A SPECTRUM OF INCREASED STATE PRODUCTION VIA AQUACULTURE OR INCREASED DEPENDENCE ON AQUACULTURED IMPORTS, BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.

ENG.,"THE WIDE APPLICATION OF MICROALGAE IN HEALTH FOODS, NUTRITIONAL FEEDS, AQUACULTURE, PHARMACEUTICAL EXTRACTS, AND BIOFUEL PRODUCTION, HAS BROUGHT ABOUT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION INDUSTRY. HOWEVER, COMMERCIAL-SCALE CULTIVATION OF MICROALGAE STILL FACES ONE MAJOR CHALLENGE, WHICH IS ITS ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY, WITH LOWER COST AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION. DEVELOPING FLOATING PHOTOBIOREACTORS TO BE UTILIZED IN OFFSHORE OPEN WATER AREAS HAS GAINED MORE INTEREST RECENTLY AS IT CAN DIMINISH THE COST EFFECTS OF ONSHORE LAND UTILIZATION, WHILE SEEKING FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS, SUCH AS REGULATED TEMPERATURE, PROXIMITY TO SUNLIGHT AND NUTRIENT SUPPLIES, AND INTEGRATED OCEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. THEREBY, THIS IS TIMELY TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF FLOATING PHOTOBIOREACTORS FOR MICROALGAE CULTIVATION IN THE OFFSHORE REGION. THIS REVIEW DELIBERATELY PRESENTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSHORE ENVIRONMENTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON MICROALGAE CULTIVATION, AS FACTORS SUCH AS LOCATION SELECTION, HEAT CAPACITY, AND UTILIZATION OF CULTIVATION RESOURCES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM CONVENTIONAL LAND-BASED CULTIVATION. COMPARED TO LAND-BASED PHOTOBIOREACTORS, THE DESIGN OF FLOATING PHOTOBIOREACTORS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT HYDRODYNAMICAL DESIGN; BY UTILIZING THE EXTERNAL FORCE FROM OCEAN WAVES TO GENERATE INTERNAL LIQUID SLOSHING FOR IMPROVING THE MIXING OF CULTIVATION MEDIUM. WHILE OFFSHORE-BASED MICROALGAE CULTIVATION IS CONSIDERABLY NEW AS PART OF BLUE ECONOMY AND MARICULTURE, THIS REVIEW PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER ADVANCEMENT OF OFFSHORE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION TECHNOLOGIES. THE ENCOURAGING FACTORS FOR HYBRIDIZATION OF OFFSHORE MICROALGAE CULTIVATION INCLUDE MARICULTURE, CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND UTILIZATION, HYDROGEN PRODUCTION, AND OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY.

CONSERV.,"TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF OCEAN-BASED ECONOMIES, MANY COUNTRIES ARE ENGAGING IN MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP) PROCESSES, WHICH REQUIRE ROBUST DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS. SYSTEMATIC CONSERVATION PLANNING (SCP) IS COMMONLY USED IN DECISION-MAKING TO GUIDE SPATIALLY EFFICIENT PROTECTED AREA EXPANSION. HERE WE CONTEND THAT SCP CAN ALSO BE USED TO STREAMLINE MSP NEGOTIATIONS BY DEVELOPING A COHERENT, INTEGRATED PORTFOLIO OF SITES FOR MULTIPLE SECTORS THAT DEPEND ON BIODIVERSITY BEING MAINTAINED IN A GOOD STATE, AS A COUNTERPOINT TO SPATIAL PRIORITIES FOR THOSE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. WE DEMONSTRATE THIS IN ALGOA BAY, SOUTH AFRICA, GIVEN THE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE BAY, AND ITS CENTRAL LOCATION IN THE FIRST NATIONAL MSP PROCESS. IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS NATIONAL PROCESS, A CIVIL-SOCIETY-LED COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WAS ESTABLISHED WITH A CORE TEAM TO LEAD STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, DATA ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT, AND SCP ANALYSES. MORE THAN 500 STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATED IN THE PROJECT AND MANY CONTRIBUTED SPATIAL DATA OR ENGAGED IN EXPERT-BASED PARTICIPATORY MAPPING. SPATIAL PRODUCTS WERE SUPPLEMENTED WITH EXISTING, PUBLISHED DATASETS. ALTOGETHER, CONSERVATION TARGETS WERE SET FOR 115 BIODIVERSITY FEATURES AND 22 NATURE-BASED ACTIVITIES, WITH THE COST LAYER BUILT FROM DATA ON 10 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES, CUMULATIVE PRESSURES (N = 31) ON ECOSYSTEMS, AND PLANNING-UNIT AREA. ALL TARGETS WERE MET IN 15% OF THE STUDY AREA, OF WHICH ONLY A THIRD (4%) WAS OUTSIDE OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS, DEMONSTRATING THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ALIGN MULTI-SECTOR PRIORITIES FOR INTACT BIODIVERSITY.

REDUCING FISHERIES' IMPACTS ON MARINE MEGAFAUNA IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IN SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSFS), WHERE ENDANGERED SPECIES CAN HAVE IMPORTANT CONSUMPTIVE USE VALUES. PAYMENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (PES) HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION, BUT THERE IS A LACK OF EMPIRICAL DATA ON IF AND HOW THEY MIGHT WORK IN THIS CONTEXT. WE PRESENT A NOVEL COMBINATION OF METHODS – SCENARIO INTERVIEWS WITH CONTINGENT VALUATION (CV) – FOR EXPLORING AND DESIGNING LOCALLY-APPROPRIATE PES SCHEMES; AND APPLY THESE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCENTIVES MIGHT INFLUENCE FISHER BEHAVIOUR AND MORTALITY OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED TAXA IN TWO CASE STUDY SSFS IN INDONESIA. FISHERS ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED POSITIVE CONDITIONAL INCENTIVES: 98 % AND 96 % OF FISHERS WOULD STOP LANDING HAMMERHEAD SHARKS (SPHYRNA SPP.) AND WEDGEFISH (RHYNCHOBATUS SPP.), RESPECTIVELY, IN CONTRAST TO 1 % AND 6 % UNDER A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO, AND 52 % AND 46 % IN RESPONSE TO A NEGATIVE INCENTIVE (FINE). CV RESULTS SHOWED THAT AN INCENTIVE-BASED SCHEME FOR CATCH MITIGATION OF ALL HAMMERHEADS AND WEDGEFISH ACROSS BOTH SITES COULD COST US$71,408–235,927 ANNUALLY, AND SAVE UP TO 18,500 AND 2140 INDIVIDUALS, RESPECTIVELY. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT PES COULD OFFER A COST-EFFECTIVE AND SOCIALLY-JUST APPROACH FOR MARINE CONSERVATION IN SSFS; AND OFFERS A SCALABLE METHOD FOR DESIGNING LOCALLY-APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT-READY SCHEMES, WHICH COULD SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF SOCIETAL GOALS SUCH AS NET POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR MARINE BIODIVERSITY AND A SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE BLUE ECONOMY. © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S)",BICOB,"H.

HOWEVER, BENEFITS OF MARINE TOURISM DO NOT TYPICALLY ACCRUE IN SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSFS), WHICH OFTEN BEAR THE COSTS OF CONSERVATION; THEY ACCRUE TO TOURISTS AND TOURIST-FOCUSSED BUSINESSES. WE EXPLORED HOW MARINE TOURISM LEVIES COULD OPERATIONALISE THE BENEFICIARY-PAYS PRINCIPLE AND ADDRESS THESE COST-BENEFIT INEQUITIES USING AN ONLINE CONTINGENT VALUATION (CV) SURVEY TO MEASURE INTERNATIONAL TOURISTS' WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY (WTP) TOWARDS COMMUNITY-BASED SHARK CONSERVATION (N = 1033). LEVIES WERE WIDELY SUPPORTED (96%), WITH MEDIAN AND TURNBULL MEAN WTP OF US$ 10–14.99 AND $22.02 PER PERSON PER DAY, RESPECTIVELY. WE COMBINED THESE RESULTS WITH DATA FROM TWO MARINE TOURISM HOTSPOTS IN INDONESIA – LOMBOK AND PULAU WEH – TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING TOURISM LEVIES TO INCENTIVIZE PRO-CONSERVATION BEHAVIOUR IN LOCAL SSFS. OUR CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT MARINE TOURISM LEVIES IN LOMBOK AND PULAU WEH COULD RESPECTIVELY GENERATE US$ 2.3–10 MILLION AND US$ 300,000–1.3 MILLION ANNUALLY – SEVERAL TIMES GREATER THAN THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF CONSERVATION INCENTIVES IN LOCAL SSFS.

SHELF SCI.,"MANGROVE PROTECTION AND RESTORATION HAVE BEEN PRIORITISED IN INDIA, AND AS A RESULT OF CONCERTED INTERVENTIONS BY KEY MARITIME STATES, MANGROVE COVER HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST FEW DECADES. MANGROVE RESTORATION EFFORTS HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE STATES OF GUJARAT, TAMIL NADU, ODISHA, AND ANDHRA PRADESH FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE MITIGATION OF STORMS AND CYCLONES. THE ‘COMMUNITY-BASED RESTORATION' STRATEGY, IN PARTICULAR, IS CREDITED WITH EXPANSION OF MANGROVE REGIONS ACROSS INDIA. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE MECHANISM OF SUCCESSFUL MANGROVE RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION THROUGH VARIOUS EFFORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THE COASTAL COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF GUJARAT, INDIA. DESPITE RAPID COASTAL DEVELOPMENT, MANGROVE COVER HAS ALSO STEADILY INCREASED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES IN THE STATE, CLEARLY INDICATING A BALANCED APPROACH TOWARDS ENHANCING BLUE ECONOMY. THIS IS CREDITED TO THE VISION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GUJARAT, INDIA FOR PUTTING IN PLACE APPROPRIATE POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION. RESTORATION OF DEGRADED MANGROVE AND AFFORESTATION OF NEW MANGROVES WERE MADE SUCCESSFUL BY APPLYING SCIENTIFIC TRANSPLANTATION OF SAPLINGS, UTILIZATION OF LOCAL RESOURCES, INVOLVEMENT OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS AND EFFICIENT MONITORING ACTIVITIES. THE GOVERNMENT OF GUJARAT HAS DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO INTEGRATE DIVERSE SECTORS TO EFFECTIVELY CONSERVE MANGROVES AND ADOPTING A COMMUNITY-BASED RESTORATION MODEL.

HOWEVER, THESE DEVELOPMENTS MAY CAUSE EXTERNALITIES, PRIMARILY AFFECTING USERS DEPENDENT ON MARITIME SPACE AND ITS SEASCAPES, SUCH AS TOURISM AND RECREATION (T&R). THE MARINE RENEWABLE EXPANSION, IN GENERAL, IS EXPECTED BY SOME OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED TO AFFECT T&R WITH THE PROSPECT OF DECREASING LOCAL WELFARE AND THE NUMBER OF VISITORS. NONETHELESS, THIS INFLUENCE OVER COASTAL AND MARITIME TOURISM & RECREATION IS NOT WELL ADDRESSED BY ACADEMIC PAPERS. HERE WE ASSESS THIS LITERATURE GAP VIA A SEMI-SYSTEMATIC NARRATIVE META-SYNTHESIS (SSNMS) WHICH EXPANDS ON THE METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS OF TWO GUIDING REFERENCE STUDIES (SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT, 2008; PARSONS & FIRESTONE, 2018) TO CONJECTURE ABOUT THIS TOPIC. THE SSNMS PROMOTES THE EVALUATION STUDIES PRODUCED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2019 SELECTED THROUGH A RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION OF RELEVANT PEER-REVIEWED KEYWORDS IN SCOPUS AND WEB OF SCIENCE. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE STUDIED KNOWLEDGE GAP PERSISTS AND THAT OWFS CAN INDEED IMPACT COASTAL COMMUNITIES DEPENDENT ON MARITIME TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, DESPITE THE OBLIGATORY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR OWFS. HOWEVER, BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS GREATLY VARY WITH DEVELOPMENT STAGES AND LOCATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, RESULTS STILL PROVIDE VALUABLE CONCLUSIONS COMMON TO GENERIC COASTAL AREAS DEALING WITH OFFSHORE WIND FARMS SITTING. IN THE FEW CASES WHERE AUTHORS CONSIDER T&R IN THEIR IMPACT ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS INDICATE A LACK OF PUBLIC SENSITIVITY AND PARTICIPATION. HIGHER CLARITY AND PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS MIGHT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN GENERATING OPTIMISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD OWF PROJECTS AND POSITIVE SYNERGIES IN BETWEEN THE LOCAL BLUE ECONOMY ACTORS. IN CONCLUSION, THE PROJECTED NEGATIVE IMPACTS MAINLY EMERGE AS A REACTION TO THE ABSENCE OF PROPER INTEGRATION BETWEEN LOCAL T&R STAKEHOLDERS AND OWF DEVELOPERS, DEMONSTRATING THAT ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE MITIGABLE AND PREVENTABLE. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A DISTINCTIVE TOURISM & RECREATION IMPACT ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE PART OF THE OBLIGATORY TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS SUBMITTED BY THE OWF DEVELOPERS IN COASTAL AREAS THAT RELY ON THESE ACTIVITIES. © 2022",EIARD,"J.T.M.

THE SECTORAL APPROACH IS KEY TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA WITH POTENTIAL FOR INCOME GENERATION, EMPLOYMENT CREATION AND POVERTY REDUCTION, AS WELL AS CREATING BLUE AND GREEN CARBON SINKS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IN AFRICAN LMES. THE SECTORS ESTABLISH LINKAGES TO COUNTRIES' ESTABLISHED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (NDCS) UNDER THE 2015 PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO PROMOTE INTEGRATED APPROACH AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA. THE APPROACH IS COMPLEMENTED BY THE UTILIZING DESK-TOP LITERATURE REVIEW AND SECONDARY DATA SOURCE ON LMES IN AFRICA FOR BLUE ECONOMY. THIS APPROACH IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH PROFESSIONAL EXPERTS' VIEWS AND OPINIONS, AND ADDITIONAL DATA GATHERED FROM FIELD VISITS TO 13 AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN AUGUST 2019 AND NAIROBI, KENYA AFRICA BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY CONSULTATIVE WORKSHOP IN OCTOBER 2019. THE BLUE ECONOMY APPROACH DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA WILL BENEFIT BOTH INLAND AND COASTAL COUNTRIES. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT A STRONG DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTINENTAL TOURISM WILL BOOST THE DEMAND FOR TOURISM SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECO-TOURISM WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSERVATION OF ECOSYSTEMS AND REDUCE THE ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT. BLUE CARBON AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP COASTAL WETLAND PROJECTS TO MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE. COASTAL PROTECTION, BIOMASS PRODUCTION AND WATER PURIFICATION ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DELIVERED BY AFRICAN LMES.

OUR PAPER AIMS AT ASSESSING THE VALUE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY MANGROVES, SEAGRASS BEDS, CORAL REEFS, AND KELP FORESTS PRESENT IN THE LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS (LMES) OF AFRICA. AFTER THE MAPPING OF COASTAL MARINE HABITATS, OUR VALUATION RELIES ON THE TRANSFER OF VALUE OF ALL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FROM REFERENCE MONETARY UNIT VALUES, EXTRACTED FROM THE LITERATURE. A HABITAT FUNCTIONALITY INDEX BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A HIGHER POPULATION DENSITY AND A HIGHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROWTH RATE LEAD TO A DECREASE IN THE FUNCTIONALITY AND SERVICES OF MARINE HABITATS WAS THEN DEFINED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE VALUATION. THE SURVEYED COASTAL HABITATS COVER ABOUT 117,000 KM2, WITH SEAGRASS BEDS BEING BY FAR THE MOST EXTENSIVE HABITAT. PRESENT ALL ALONG THE COASTS OF AFRICA, THEIR SURFACE AREA REPRESENTS ABOUT 62% OF SURVEYED COASTAL HABITATS, FOLLOWED BY THE MANGROVES (23%), CORAL REEFS (15%). KELP FORESTS ARE ONLY PRESENT IN THE SOUTHERN BENGUELA CURRENT LME. WE ESTIMATED THE ANNUAL VALUE OF THE LME'S COASTAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT 814 BILLION USD. CORAL REEFS HAVE THE HIGHEST VALUE (588 BILLION USD/YEAR), FOLLOWED BY SEAGRASS BEDS (135 BILLION USD/YEAR), MANGROVES (91 BILLION USD/YEAR), AND KELP FORESTS (0.4 BILLION USD/YEAR). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FROM THE FOUR COASTAL HABITAT TYPES HAD THE HIGHEST VALUE IN THE AGULHAS CURRENT LME, REPRESENTING 38% OF THE TOTAL VALUE, FOLLOWED BY THE RED SEA LME (28%) AND THE SOMALI COASTAL CURRENT LME (10%). THE THREE LMES OF THE ATLANTIC SIDE REPRESENT 15% OF THE TOTAL ESTIMATED VALUE.

INT.,"THE “BLUE ECONOMY (BE)” IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR CONCEPT AS A STRATEGY FOR SAFEGUARDING THE WORLD'S OCEANS AND WATER RESOURCES. IT MAY EMERGE WHEN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS IN BALANCE WITH THE LONG TERM CAPACITY OF OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITY IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER. IMPORTANTLY, THE CONCEPT OF BE POSITS THE INHERENT CONFLICTS BETWEEN TWO DISCOURSES—GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND PROTECTION OF OCEAN RESOURCES. THE INHERENT CONFLICTS REQUIRE SOLUTIONS TO EMBRACE THE OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCEAN ECONOMY WHILE RECOGNIZING AND ADDRESSING ITS THREATS. THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS ON A GLOBAL SCALE ARE ADVOCATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN THEIR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS). HOWEVER, WE NOTICE THAT THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES OF THE BE IN LINE WITH THE UN'S SDGS IS VAGUE EVEN CHALLENGING, AND THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR INTERESTS AND ROLES IN THE BE ARE ALSO VAGUE. THIS REVIEW EXAMINES THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE BE AND THE UN'S SDGS, AND RELEVANCE AND ALIGNMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THE LINK BETWEEN THE BE AND SDGS. BASED ON A LITERATURE SURVEY BETWEEN 1998 AND 2018, WE FIND THAT BE IS HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH SDGS 14–17. NOTABLY, WE FIND THAT STAKEHOLDERS PREFER SDG 3 GOOD HEALTH & WELL-BEING AND SDG 8 DECENT WORK & ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE BE CONTEXT. AS STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT SHOWS SOME DIFFERENCES AND VARIATIONS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BE AND SDGS, WE CONSIDER THAT STAKEHOLDERS CAN PLAY SOME ROLES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE BE-SDGS CONTEXT. IN ORDER TO SET ACHIEVABLE GOALS AND TARGETS IN BE-SDGS, WE SUPPORT THAT KEY STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED TO PLAY SEVERAL IMPORTANT ROLES IN PROSPEROUS ECONOMIC, SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT AND SETTING TOLERABLE RANGES FOR THE OCEAN BIOSPHERE. © 2020 THE AUTHORS",ENVID,"J.S.

IN DOING SO, THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON FOR-PROFIT BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BY HIGHLIGHTING HOW CAPITAL'S RISK INTERPRETATIONS ARE CONSTITUTIVE OF THE EFFORT TO CREATE NEW MARKETS.

CLEAN. PROD.,"LARGE-SCALE SEAWEED AQUACULTURE IN THE OCEAN IS BEING PURSUED GLOBALLY AS A SOLUTION TO MANY CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES, INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE, FOOD SECURITY, AND ECOSYSTEM DEGRADATION. HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORMATION OF MARINE SYSTEMS FOR FARMING MAY HAVE UNKNOWN IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS THOSE OUTLINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS). THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO OUTLINE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR, AND THREATS FROM, SEAWEED FARMING IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABILITY. WE SYNTHESISE THE PERSPECTIVES OF EXPERT STAKEHOLDERS FROM MULTIPLE SECTORS THROUGH A SERIES OF AUSTRALIAN WORKSHOPS TO CATALOGUE THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH SEAWEED FARMING MAY AFFECT SUSTAINABILITY, GIVING SPECIFIC FOCUS TO THE SDGS. IN DOING SO, THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATES THAT SEAWEED FARMING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE, TO SOME DEGREE, THE MAJORITY OF SDGS, WITH BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INFLUENCES. INDEED, SEAWEED FARMING IS MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING SDGS 2 (ZERO HUNGER), 8 (DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH), 9 (INDUSTRY, INNOVATION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE), 12 (SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION), AND 15 (LIFE ON LAND). BUT EXPECTATIONS OF SEAWEED FARMING MAY ALSO FALL SHORT FOR SUPPORTING SOME GOALS IF APPROPRIATE MEASURES ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL IMPACTS, MOST NOTABLY SDG 14 (LIFE BELOW WATER). WE UNDERSCORE THAT SEAWEED FARMING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AND THAT THIS POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE REALISED WITH APPROPRIATE REGULATION AND MITIGATION TO AVOID UNWANTED NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. BETTER IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN THESE POTENTIAL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ACROSS SUSTAINABILITY DOMAINS, WILL BE CRITICAL FOR REALISING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF SEAWEED AQUACULTURE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD",JCROE,"S.

THE DATABASE IS COMPOSED OF 28 ANTHROPOGENIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAYERS CATEGORIZED INTO SEVEN BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS. THE DATABASE IS ANALYZED WITH A SET OF GEOSPATIAL MODELS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES AT SEA AND THE POTENTIAL MARINE USE CONFLICTS EMERGING FROM THE AGGREGATION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES. ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES WERE CHARACTERIZED IN TERMS OF MARINE MAMMALS, LOBSTERS, COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT AND THREATENED FISH SPECIES, AND PELAGIC BIRDS AND MAPPED AS BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS USING GEOGRAPHIC CLUSTER ANALYSIS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MOST INTENSELY USED SEA AREAS ARE LOCATED ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF BANGLADESH, AS WELL AS IN THE SWATCH OF NO GROUND (SONG) AREA, WITH MAXIMUM MARINE USE INTENSITY (MUI) SCORES RANGING FROM 5 TO 8. OFFSHORE WATERS OF SAINT MARTIN'S ISLAND HAVE HIGHER MUI SCORES (≥ 5) AS WELL. THE PAIRWISE SPATIAL CONFLICT ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT NATURE PROTECTION SITES PARTICULARLY SONG MARINE PROTECTED AREA (MPA), NIJHUM DWIP MARINE RESERVE (MR), AND SAINT MARTIN'S ISLAND MPA ARE EXPOSED TO THE HIGH MARINE USE CONFLICTS (MUC) INDUCED BY FISHING AND SHIPPING ACTIVITIES. FISHING OPERATIONS GENERATE THE HIGHEST MUC VALUE (MUC = 30) IN SONG MPA, WHEREAS SHIPPING ACTIVITIES PRODUCE THE HIGHEST MUC VALUE (MUC = 24) IN NIJHUM DWIP MR. BOTH OF THE MPAS EXHIBIT 6 TO 12 MUC SCORES INDUCED BY SHIPPING. THE PROPOSED DATABASE TOGETHER WITH THE ILLUSTRATED ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES USED IN THIS STUDY AND KEY FINDINGS CAN PROVIDE THE FIRST UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRIORITIES FOR ECOSYSTEM BASED MANAGEMENT OF BANGLADESH'S MARINE SPACE AND PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS ON THE URGENCY FOR MSP PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY.

ENVIRON. MANAGE.,"A SUSTAINABLE COASTAL “BLUE ECONOMY” IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE NEW ERA. HOWEVER, THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS MUST RECOGNIZE THE INTERDEPENDENCE IN THE COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EMPLOYED SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING TO MAP THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF SECCHI DISK DEPTH (SDD) IN HAINAN COASTAL WATERS, CHINA FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND QUANTITATIVELY REVEALED THE IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS ON THE COASTAL WATER ENVIRONMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. BASED ON THE MODERATE RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER (MODIS) IN SITU CONCURRENT MATCHUPS (N = 123), A SIMPLE GREEN BAND (555 NM)-BASED QUADRATIC ALGORITHM WAS FIRST DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE SDD FOR THE COASTAL WATERS OF HAINAN ISLAND IN CHINA (R2 = 0.70, ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) = 1.74 M). THE LONG TIME-SERIES SDD DATASET (2001–2021) FOR HAINAN COASTAL WATERS WAS RECONSTRUCTED FROM MODIS OBSERVATIONS. SPATIALLY, SDD SHOWED A PATTERN OF HIGH WATER CLARITY IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN COASTAL WATERS AND LOW WATER CLARITY IN THE WESTERN AND NORTHERN COASTAL AREAS. THIS PATTERN IS ATTRIBUTED TO UNBALANCED DISTRIBUTIONS OF BATHYMETRY AND POLLUTION FROM SEAGOING RIVERS. SEASONALLY, THE HUMID TROPICAL MONSOON CLIMATE DROVE THE SDD INTO A GENERAL PATTERN OF HIGH IN THE WET SEASON AND LOW IN THE DRY SEASON. ANNUALLY, THE SDD IN HAINAN COASTAL WATERS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.1), BENEFITING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE INCREASING GLOBAL OCEANIC WIND SPEED IN RECENT YEARS HAS EXACERBATED SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION AND DEEP OCEAN MIXING, COUNTERACTING APPROXIMATELY 14.14% OF THE REMEDIAL MANAGEMENT'S EFFECTIVENESS IN PROTECTING AND RESTORING THE COASTAL ECOSYSTEM.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS THUS TO EVALUATE WHAT SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION OF THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT MAY (OR MAY NOT) LOOK LIKE IN A LOCALITY FACING COMPETING SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PRESSURES, SPECIFICALLY TAITUNG COUNTY IN TAIWAN. WE CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH KEY ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE OVER THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MIRAMAR RESORT IN TAITUNG, AND ASSESS THESE THROUGH THE CONCEPTUAL LENS OF SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION.

CONSEQUENTLY, WHERE THE PLANNING OUTCOMES AFFECT THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN MARINE AREAS, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. HOWEVER, THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IN MSP HAS GAINED LITTLE ATTENTION IN STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT LITERATURE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ELABORATE ON THE BUSINESS SECTOR'S INTEREST AND INVOLVEMENT IN MSP IN THE BALTIC SEA REGION. THE FINDINGS ARE BASED ON THE FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCES OF MSP AUTHORITIES AND EXPERTS. FURTHERMORE, PERSPECTIVES FROM TWO SEA-USE SECTORS, MARITIME TRANSPORT AND MARINE TOURISM, HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED USING ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRES TO DISCOVER THEIR VIEWS. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON THE QUESTIONS OF WHO TO INVOLVE AND WHAT ARE THE DRIVING FORCES PROMOTING BUSINESS SECTOR INVOLVEMENT. EVEN THOUGH MSP IS A FORM OF BROAD-SCALE PLANNING, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALL SPATIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL SCALES FROM LOCAL TO INTERNATIONAL AND FROM SMALL ENTERPRISES TO UMBRELLA ORGANISATIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN DESIGNING APPROACH TO BUSINESS STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION. THE PLANNING AUTHORITIES NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF INVOLVING DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESS STAKEHOLDERS. PLANNERS OFTEN RELY ON ORGANISATIONS THAT REPRESENT BUSINESS STAKEHOLDERS AND INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES. IT IS RESOURCE EFFECTIVE TO INTERACT WITH REPRESENTATIVES AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A WIDE AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RESPECTIVE SECTOR'S INTERESTS. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES IT IS BENEFICIAL TO ALSO INTEGRATE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES, ESPECIALLY IN LOCAL OR REGIONAL CONTEXTS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS",NA,"H.

USING THE CASE OF MARINE AQUACULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARGUE THAT A SHIFT IN FOCUS TO COMMUNITY WELLBEING IS NECESSARY TO REALIZE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF MARINE AQUACULTURE EXPANSION. MORE GENERALLY, WE SUGGEST THAT MARINE AQUACULTURE ILLUSTRATES THE NEED TO REORIENT BLUE ECONOMY TO BLUE COMMUNITIES, A CONCEPT THAT DRAWS ON THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONCEPT OF WELLBEING TO FOREGROUND SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ALONGSIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH.

THE INTEGRATION OF ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IN THE DECISION-MAKING MAY HELP TO DESIGN KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT GUARANTEE A GOOD MARINE LITTER MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE BLUE ECONOMY FRAMEWORK. NONETHELESS, THERE IS NO CLEAR METHODOLOGY TO DO SUCH ASSESSMENTS IN THE LITERATURE. IN THIS STUDY A NEW APPROACH WAS IMPLEMENTED BY ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE EFFICIENCY OF FOUR SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO REMOVE, MONITOR AND/OR MANAGE FLOATING MARINE LITTER (FML). IN ADDITION, THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY BY LOCAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS FOR PURCHASING SUCH SOLUTIONS WAS ASSESSED. THE SOLUTIONS WERE TESTED IN THE INNER WATERS OF THE BASQUE COAST (SOUTH-EASTERN BAY OF BISCAY), THESE BEING: THE COLLECTION OF FML BY (1) A LITTER INTERCEPTION RIVERINE BARRIER; (2) RETROFITTED FISHING VESSELS ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVE FISHING FOR LITTER; (3) SEA-CLEANING VESSELS OPERATED WITH AND WITHOUT (4) A SMART DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL (LEMA TOOL). THE EFFICIENCY WAS MEASURED BY THE COST OF REMOVING 1 KG OF FML AND COMPARING IT TO OTHER ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES; THE EFFECTIVENESS BY A COMPARISON OF COSTS AND BENEFITS OF REMOVING MARINE LITTER FOR THE LOCAL FISHERIES, AQUACULTURE, PORTS AND SHIPPING AND TOURISM SECTORS; AND THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY WAS EVALUATED BY CONTINGENT VALUATION METHOD. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DENSITY OF FML AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF THE EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND WILLINGNESS TO PAY AND IN RETURN, THE DENSITY DEPENDS ON THE OPERATING GROUND AND THE SEASON OF THE YEAR AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE MOST EFFICIENT SOLUTION IS THE CLEANING VESSELS (4–7 EUR/KG OF FML), FOLLOWED BY THE FISHING FOR LITTER FISHING VESSELS (4–75 EUR/KG). LEMA TOOL MAY IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF BOTH, FISHING VESSELS AND CLEANING VESSEL, BUT THE RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT DEPENDS ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FISHERS, THE ACCURACY OF THE SEA SURFACE CIRCULATION MODELS AND AGAIN THE LOCAL LITTER DENSITY. THE BARRIER PROVED TO BE THE LEAST EFFICIENT SOLUTION (103 EUR/KG) AND ITS EFFICIENCY DEPENDS ON THE RIVER CHARACTERISTICS. CLEANING VESSELS ARE AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION, FISHING VESSEL MAY BE EFFECTIVE DEPENDING ON THE OPERATING AREA AMONG OTHER VARIABLES. THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION FOR PURCHASING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE THE REMOVAL OF FML IS ESTIMATED AS 1–8 EUR/KG. THESE OUTPUTS CAN PROVIDE GOOD GUIDANCE FOR DECISION-MAKERS TO OVERCOME THE EXISTING PROBLEM WHILE PREVENTION MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED AND TAKE EFFECT IN THE ENVIRONMENT. RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING VESSELS ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVE AND THE PASSIVE FISHING FOR LITTER, WHEN THE SCOPES OF EACH ACTIVITY ARE WELL DEFINED, AND OVERLAPPING IS INEXISTENT. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"M.

VARIOUS CONTESTED INTERPRETATIONS EXIST, AND DIFFERENT ACTORS CHOOSE TO EMPHASISE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE TRIPLE GOAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER, DESPITE DISAGREEMENT OVER ITS INTERPRETATIONS, THE BLUE ECONOMY FINDS SUPPORT IN MANY DIFFERENT ARENAS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE POSITION OF DOMINANCE THAT THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS REACHED, AND EXAMINES HOW SUPPORTERS OF THE CONCEPT MAINTAIN AND EMPLOY POWER TO KEEP IT RELEVANT. THE PAPER APPLIES A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH: 29 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE IN ROLES OF FORMAL DECISION-MAKING ACROSS THE FISHERIES SECTOR, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TOURISM SECTOR, CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENT SECTOR, AND SPECIFIC BLUE ECONOMY-INSTITUTIONS ARE SUPPLEMENTED BY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE WIDER LANDSCAPE DURING 4 MONTHS OF FIELDWORK IN SEYCHELLES. FINDINGS SHOW THAT IN INTERNATIONAL DISCOURSE, THE BLUE ECONOMY OBTAINS AND MAINTAINS ITS INFLUENCE THROUGH PERSUASION AND THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A ‘COMMON SENSE’ AND PRODUCTIVE WAY FORWARD, CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING TRIPLE WINS. WITHIN THIS NARRATIVE, OCEANS ARE UNDERGOING A RECONFIGURATION AS ECONOMIC FRONTIERS, AND THE BLUE ECONOMY PLACES ECONOMIC GROWTH FROM OCEANS CENTRALLY WITHIN CONTEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. MAINTAINING THE BLUE ECONOMY AS A POWERFUL CONCEPT ON THE GROUND IS DONE THROUGH SOCIAL POWER RELATIONS: THE BLUE ECONOMY FUNCTIONS AS A BOUNDARY OBJECT, CONTRIBUTING TO DEPOLITICISATION OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A SHARED VISION. DEPOLITICISATION ALLOWS SEYCHELLES TO CONTINUE USING THE CONCEPT DESPITE SIMMERING DISSENT AMONG POLICY MAKERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND RESOURCE USERS. DOMINANCE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE MEANS THAT ASSOCIATING WITH IT BRINGS SEYCHELLES VISIBILITY AND INFLUENCE. THE USEFULNESS OF THE CONCEPT IN ELIDING TENSIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR COUNTER-HEGEMONY TO ARISE, ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVES ARE EMERGING ELSEWHERE, SUCH AS BLUE JUSTICE.

THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO MAP THE CONSTRUCTION AND MOBILIZATION OF THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THROUGH CASE STUDIES OF THREE REGIONAL BODIES: THE PACIFIC SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES GROUPING (PSIDS), THE PACIFIC ISLANDS DEVELOPMENT FORUM (PIDF), AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM (PIF). RATHER THAN WORKING TO UNCOVER SOME CENTRAL DEFINITION OR UNDERSTANDING OF A PACIFIC BLUE ECONOMY, THIS PAPER FRAMES THE CONCEPT AS A POLITICAL TOOL THAT IS MOBILIZED BY SPECIFIC AGENTS IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND IN PURSUIT OF SPECIFIC GOALS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS BEEN ENGAGED AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLITICAL MANEUVER BY PACIFIC REGIONAL BODIES, WITH THESE AGENTS LEVERAGING THE CONCEPT ACROSS BOTH REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PLATFORMS TO ADVANCE THEIR POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC INTERESTS. HOWEVER, EMERGING OBSERVATIONS ALSO INDICATE A POTENTIAL DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE POLITICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS CONCEPT AND ITS MATERIAL REALITY, NAMELY ITS ABILITY TO ADVANCE SUSTAINABLE OCEAN DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES ON THE GROUND TO THE BENEFIT OF PACIFIC COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS.

THIS STUDY CONSIDERS DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE PRACTICES IN REGIONAL PLANNING TO HELP MEET REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES. THE MSP PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTING THE COASTAL FISHERY (FISHING AND FISH FARMING) IN THE SATAKUNTA REGION, FINLAND, EXEMPLIFY A LOCAL STAKEHOLDER GROUP. COASTAL FISHERY IS A DEMANDING AND HIGHLY REGULATED LIVELIHOOD, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO GROW AS LOCAL FOOD IS TRENDING. A MIXED-METHOD APPROACH WAS USED TO EXAMINE MSP PARTICIPANTS’ AND FISHERY EXPERTS’ PERCEPTIONS ABOUT REGIONAL COOPERATION AND THE MSP PROCESS. THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS FOCUSED ON THREE MAIN THEMES: REGIONAL COOPERATION AND SYNERGIES, CONFLICTS AND THREATS, AND INTEREST IN REGIONAL COLLABORATION OR ESTABLISHING SECONDARY BUSINESSES. QUESTIONNAIRES 2019 AND 2021 EXAMINED STAKEHOLDERS’ ENGAGEMENT (INTRINSIC MOTIVATION) AND SOCIAL TRUST TOWARDS THE PLANNERS IN THE MSP PROCESS. THE NEED TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES OF COASTAL FISHERY DICTATES COASTAL FISHERY PARTICIPANTS’ PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE FISHERY BUSINESS'S DEVELOPMENT IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT.

A GLOBAL CONSENSUS ON MANAGEMENT COOPERATION IS EMERGING, BUT THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF COOPERATION HAS NOT YET TO BE PROVEN. THIS PAPER TAKES THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT, TECHNOLOGY LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE AND THE AMOUNT OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE TO BE TREATED AS VARIABLES AFFECTING THE COOPERATIVE INCOME TO CONSTRUCT A COOPERATIVE NETWORK GAME MODEL FOR MARINE PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ECONOMICS. THE PAPER DISTRIBUTES BENEFITS BASED ON THE ""MYERSON VALUE"", ANALYZES THE EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS OF THE MODEL AND TESTS THE STABILITY OF COOPERATION. IN ADDITION, NUMERICAL ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT USING ACTUAL DATA FROM KEY COUNTRIES TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICAL ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF COOPERATION IN MARINE PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT. THE FINDINGS INCLUDE: (1) THE TECHNOLOGY LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE AND THE AMOUNT OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE TO BE TREATED HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY'S CHOICE OF COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIES AND THE STABILITY OF COOPERATIVE ALLIANCE, WHILE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS CONDUCTIVE TO IT. (2) THE SIZE OF THE ALLIANCE HAS AN IMPACT ON COUNTRY'S STRATEGIC CHOICES AND THE STABILITY OF THE ALLIANCES. TOO SMALL AN ALLIANCE IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO COOPERATIVE ALLIANCE BUILDING, WHICH GRADUALLY BECOMES MORE LIKELY AS THE SIZE OF THE ALLIANCE INCREASES, BUT IT IS UNCERTAIN THE EFFECT OF OVERSIZED ALLIANCE AND WHAT SIZE IS MOST APPROPRIATE.

HERE, THE RELEVANT POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE ARRANGEMENTS ARE FRAGMENTED, AND MARINE USES, ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES ARE GENERALLY MANAGED ON A SECTORAL BASIS BY INDEPENDENT ENTITIES FROM MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS.

MANAGE.,"SCUBA DIVING CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN MARINE TOURISM, BUT ITS SUSTAINABILITY IS CURRENTLY THREATENED DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC RISKS. THE EAST AFRICAN MARINE ECOREGION IS RENOWNED FOR ITS RICHNESS IN MARINE FAUNA AND FLORA, INCLUDING SOME OF THE INDIAN OCEAN'S MOST DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS, MAKING IT A POPULAR DESTINATION FOR SCUBA DIVERS. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EXTERNAL RISKS (INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC) ARE IMPACTING ON DIVE OPERATORS IN THE REGION, CREATING THE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE IMPACTS. THIS RESEARCH WAS THEREFORE AIMED AT IDENTIFYING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE EXTERNAL RISKS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIVE OPERATORS, VIA AN EXPLORATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED REVEALED THAT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON DIVE OPERATORS IN THE EAST AFRICAN MARINE ECOREGION, AND THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF CORAL REEFS, WHILE NOT SEEN AS A THREAT TO DIVE OPERATORS AT PRESENT, CONSTITUTES A KEY THREAT WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE. IN TERMS OF THE VARIATION IN PERCEIVED RISK ACROSS THE REGION, KENYA SUFFERS MOST FROM SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RISKS, TANZANIA FROM ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, MOZAMBIQUE FROM POLITICAL RISKS, AND SOUTH AFRICA FROM ECONOMIC RISKS. THE RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO AFRICA'S BLUE ECONOMY, WHICH AIMS TO GUIDE AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN SUSTAINABLE USE OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT WHILE HARNESSING ITS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS.

MANAGE.,"TAIWAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES A NATIONAL LEVEL COASTAL BLUE ECONOMY GROWTH (CBEG) PROGRAM TO PROMOTE OCEAN-LINKED INDUSTRIES BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. SEA FARMING DEVELOPMENT IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT NEEDS TO BE PROMOTED FOR THE CBEG PROGRAM. GENERALLY, SEA FARMING RELIES ON ARTIFICIAL TECHNOLOGIES, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TO INCREASE FISHERY RESOURCES AND TO ENHANCE FISHERIES PRODUCTIVITY. DEVELOPING SEA FARMING COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF CAPTURE FISHERIES; IT INTEGRATES THE CONCEPT OF BLUE ECONOMY INTO SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO AS TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN FISHING COMMUNITIES. IN LINE WITH THIS, THE TAIWAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE COMMUNITY-BASED SEA FARMING (CBSF) PROJECT IN 2015. THE CBSF PROJECT AIMS TO ESTABLISH SEA FARMING ZONES TO HELP FISHING COMMUNITIES ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PAPER, THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF SEA FARMING AND SITE SELECTION OF THE CBSF PROJECT WERE DESCRIBED AND THE NEEDS OF LOCAL PEOPLE IN FISHING COMMUNITIES AROUND SEA-FARMING DEMONSTRATION ZONES WERE ALSO ASSESSED. ACCORDING TO FINDINGS, A FRAMEWORK FOR SEA FARMING DEVELOPMENT IS PROPOSED. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, SEVERAL NEW SEA FARMING-BASED INDUSTRIES CAN SERVE AS THE DRIVING FORCE TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FISHING COMMUNITIES. THE DRIVING FORCES INCLUDE DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY-BASED TOURISM RECREATIONAL INDUSTRY, STRENGTHENING LOCALIZED MARKETING OF FEATURED SEAFOOD PRODUCTS, COMBINING LOCAL ECOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES AND CULTURES OF THE FISHING VILLAGE TO DEVELOP RECREATIONAL FISHERY ACTIVITIES, AND INTEGRATING SEAFOOD PRODUCTS WITH RECREATIONAL TOURISM ACTIVITIES. OVERALL, CBSF ARE IMPORTANT TASKS THAT WARRANT CONTINUOUS ATTENTION FOR ENHANCING THE FISHING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE EXPERIENCES AND FRAMEWORK OF PROMOTING THE TAIWAN CBSF PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE BENEFICIAL INFORMATION AND FOUNDATION FOR DECISION MAKERS AND NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGERS IN OTHER AREAS. © 2019 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,"J.-L.

IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS NEW CONCEPT REQUIRES A NEW SET OF GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES, OR WHETHER EXISTING POLICY MECHANISMS CAN ACCOMMODATE IT. USING TIMOR LESTE AS A CASE STUDY, WE EXAMINE POLICY COHERENCE AND COORDINATION ACROSS A RANGE OF MARITIME SECTORS. WE DO SO THROUGH CONTENT ANALYSIS OF FORMAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS LEGISLATION AND POLICY DOCUMENTS, AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH GOVERNANCE ACTORS AND ORGANIZATIONS. WE ASSESS POLICY COHERENCE BY EXAMINING WHETHER GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES ARE SHARED WITHIN AND ACROSS EXISTING SECTOR-BASED POLICIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH BLUE ECONOMY OBJECTIVES. WE EXPLORE POLICY COORDINATION THROUGH NETWORK ANALYSIS OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS PEOPLE. A NUMBER OF GAPS IN THE TIMOR LESTE POLICY LANDSCAPE ARE APPARENT, WITH WEAK GOVERNANCE AROUND SOCIAL OBJECTIVES, PARTICULARLY IN THE PORTS SECTOR. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, THE EXISTING GOVERNING SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH BLUE ECONOMY ASPIRATIONS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE EXISTING, HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL POLICY DOCUMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY PLAYING A CRITICAL BRIDGING ROLE BETWEEN SECTORS. STRENGTHENING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SECTORAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, THROUGH BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING INSTRUMENTS, MAY THEREFORE BE AN EFFICIENT AND PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO BLUE ECONOMY IMPLEMENTATION. THIS APPROACH WOULD ALLOW MORE FOCUSED ATTENTION ON PLUGGING POLICY GAPS AND ADDRESSING DEFICIENCIES IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM. © 2020 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,"M.

MANAGE.,"A NUMBER OF COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED THAT UP UNTIL NOW MARINE/MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP) RESEARCH AND PRACTICE HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY BLUE ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND HAVE TENDED TO NEGLECT WHAT MIGHT BE REGARDED AS SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS. TO GAIN MORE INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER AND EXTENT OF SUCH A GAP, AS WELL AS HOW TO ADDRESS IT, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES ON MSP BETWEEN 2005 AND 2020. USING SEARCH TERMS SUCH AS PARTICIPATION, DEMOCRACY, SOCIAL INCLUSION, SOCIAL COHESION, EQUITY WE SYSTEMATICALLY IDENTIFY AND REVIEW 310 SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES THAT ADDRESS DIVERSE SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS WITHIN MSP AND MARINE GOVERNANCE. THE REVIEW SHOWED THAT VERY FEW PAPERS SYSTEMATICALLY CONCEPTUALISED OR DEVELOPED A COHERENT FRAMEWORK FOR ENGAGING WITH SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. INSTEAD, THEY MOSTLY ADDRESSED PARTICULAR SOCIAL CONCERNS INCLUDING PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT, EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, SOCIO-CULTURAL VALUES AND PREFERENCES. MARINE MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS RELATED INSTRUMENTAL FRAMINGS OF THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATION WERE THE KEY ARGUMENTS FOR INCLUDING THESE DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IN MSP. IN TERMS OF HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IN MSP, MOST ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO SOCIAL-CULTURAL MAPPING AND WAYS TO IMPROVE SOCIAL INCLUSION/PARTICIPATION WHILE ALSO REDRESSING EXCLUSION AND MALDISTRIBUTION OF OUTCOMES IN MSP PRACTICE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO DEEPEN AND DIVERSIFY MSP INQUIRY WITH RESPECT TO SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. IN PARTICULAR, SCHOLARS WOULD DO WELL TO DELVE DEEPER AND MORE BROADLY IN SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE TO FIND INSPIRATION ON WAYS TO UNDERSTAND AND ELUCIDATE SOCIAL ISSUES. HERE, THE ENORMOUS BODY OF RELEVANT WORK ON JUSTICE, POWER, CRITICAL INSTITUTIONALISM, POLITICAL ECOLOGY AND TERRESTRIAL PLANNING LITERATURES HAS HARDLY BEEN TAPPED. IT IS ALSO EVIDENT FROM THIS REVIEW THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR BOTH THE ACADEMIC AND PRACTICE-BASED COMMUNITIES TO MORE COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS HOW THE MULTIDIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS WITH ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF MARINE PLANNING AND GOVERNANCE. BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS, WE HIGHLIGHT A SET OF SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO DEVELOP MSP RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ON SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE ARGUE THAT MORE IN-DEPTH CO-PRODUCTION, LINKING SCHOLARS, PRACTITIONERS AND SOCIETY ACTORS, IS NEEDED. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S)",OCMAE,"M.

AS A REGIONALLY IMPORTANT EXTENSION TO THE OTHERWISE NARROW EAST AFRICAN CONTINENTAL SHELF, THE NORTH KENYA BANKS REMAIN UNDER STUDIED WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. THE LOCAL MARINE ECOSYSTEM IS KNOWN TO BE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY WIND DRIVEN UPWELLING PROCESSES WITH SEASONAL VARIABILITY DRIVEN BY THE CHANGING MONSOON SEASONS BEING OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE. NEVERTHELESS, THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN IS WARMING DUE TO ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE WITH EVIDENCE INDICATING REDUCED OCEAN PRODUCTIVITY IN FUTURE. HOW THE ECOSYSTEM OF THE NORTH KENYA BANKS WILL RESPOND IS CURRENTLY UNCERTAIN BUT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COASTAL FISHERY RESOURCES TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES, AND GROWING BLUE ECONOMY INITIATIVES TO EXPLOIT THE NORTH KENYA BANKS FISHERIES MORE WIDELY. THERE IS, HOWEVER, LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROCESSES INFLUENCING PRODUCTIVITY OVER THE NORTH KENYA BANKS REGIONS AND CURRENTLY THERE IS NO MANAGEMENT PLAN IN PLACE TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGE THE FISHERY RESOURCES.

IN SOME COUNTRIES, WHERE LEGISLATION IS APPROPRIATELY APPLIED TO THE LOGISTICS OF MARINE FISHING OPERATIONS, SOME MEASURES OF CONTAINMENT AND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. HOWEVER, OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE NO EFFECTIVE PLANS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECTOR. IN THIS PAPER, WE HAVE COMPILED INFORMATION ON THE HISTORICAL DISCREPANCIES IN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN THE EXTENSIVE BRAZILIAN WATERS AND USED IT TO ILLUSTRATE THE INSTITUTIONAL NEGLECT OF THIS IMPORTANT BLUE-ECONOMY SECTOR. SINCE THE 1930S, WHEN THE FIRST MANAGEMENT AGENCIES WERE REGISTERED, FISHERIES MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN HANDLED BY AT LEAST 10 DIFFERENT FEDERAL AGENCIES. THIS DISCONTINUITY HAS RESULTED IN A COUNTRY THAT IS IGNORANT, OVERALL, OF THE QUANTITY FISHED, WHERE FISHING OCCURS, AND THE STATUS OF ITS FISH STOCKS. THE ONLY AVAILABLE LONG-TERM FISHING PRODUCTION DATA IS HELD BY SMALL STATE DEPARTMENTS OR MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO REFLECTING THE TOTAL CATCH OF THE COUNTRY, WITH ITS CONTINENTAL DIMENSIONS AND ITS MIX OF ARTISANAL AND INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES. FOR THIS REASON, THE PRESENT WORK HAS COMPILED INFORMATION ON THE YEARS OF NEGLECT IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE FISHING SECTOR. IN ADDITION, WE SUGGEST THE CREATION OF A PIVOTAL MANAGEMENT MODEL, BASED ON THREE MAIN PILLARS, FOR SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,"J.B.G.

MANAGE.,"A COUNTRY'S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO CAN PREDICT ITS SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF DIVERSIFICATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH PATTERNS. HOWEVER, HOW DOES THE SUSTAINABLE PORTFOLIO OF BLUE PRODUCTS PREDICT THE DEVELOPMENT DEGREE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY? HEREIN, WE COMBINE THE METHODS OF NETWORK SCIENCE (I.E., THE PRODUCT SPACE) AND ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY (I.E., THE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY AND COUNTRY COMPLEXITY) TO DRAW THE WORLD BLUE PRODUCT SPACE FOR 2017 AND THE EVOLUTION MAPS OF BLUE PRODUCT SPACE BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. FROM 1995 TO 2015 AND RANK THE 66 BLUE PRODUCTS AND 235 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, RESPECTIVELY. WE FIND THAT (I) HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES ARE THE MAIN EXPORTERS OF MORE COMPLEX BLUE PRODUCTS, WHILE LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES ARE THE MAIN EXPORTERS OF LESS SOPHISTICATED BLUE PRODUCTS. WE ALSO FIND THAT (II) THE EXPORT SHARES OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED BLUE PRODUCTS INCREASE WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, WHILE THE EXPORT SHARES OF THE LESS SOPHISTICATED BLUE PRODUCTS DECREASE WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT (III) THE DIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT LEVEL OF THE BLUE ECONOMY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO INCOME; THAT IS, COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER INCOME HAVE A GREATER LEVEL OF BLUE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY, AND VICE VERSA. THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT NETWORK SCIENCE AND ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT LEVEL OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, AND THEY CAN BE USED AS AN ADDITIONAL POLICY ANALYSIS COMBINATION FOR MEASURING THE EXTENT OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,NA,NA,NA,09645691,OCEAN AND COASTAL MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,7,NA,NA,NA,FINAL,ELSEVIER LTD,SCOPUS,BUILDING A BRIDGE BETWEEN ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY AND THE BLUE ECONOMY,ARTICLE,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120431735&doi=10.1016%2fj.ocecoaman.2021.105987&partnerID=40&md5=99e211515589259e14eb9c2eb15d9296,216,2022,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,none,QILU UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (SHANDONG ACADEMY OF SCIENCES),QILU UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (SHANDONG ACADEMY OF SCIENCES),NA,"QI X, 2022, OCEAN COAST MANAGE","QI X, 2022, OCEAN COAST MANAGE"

MANAGE.,"THE VULNERABILITY OF COASTAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS PROVIDES STRONG ARGUMENTS FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT (EAFM) WHICH INCORPORATES BOTH HUMAN AND ECOSYSTEM WELL-BEING WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE PRESENT STATUS, FUTURE POTENTIALS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FRAMEWORK OF THE EAFM FOR THE SUSTAINABLE COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT OF BANGLADESH. USING BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES OF INFORMATION, THIS STUDY HAS FOUND THAT SOME LEVELS OF EAFM ARE ALREADY IN PRACTICE TO SOME EXTENT IN SOME SPECIFIC COASTAL RIVER ECOSYSTEMS ALONG THE HILSA (TENUALOSA ILISHA) SANCTUARIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF JUVENILE AND BROOD HILSA, BUT OFTEN NOT IMPLEMENTED AND MANAGED IN AN APPROPRIATE PLANNED AND OBJECTIVE WAY. THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF ECOSYSTEM WELL-BEING FOR A FEW FISHERIES BUT SOME LEVELS OF DETERIORATION OF THE ECOSYSTEM HAVE BEEN NOTICED AS WELL. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS ECOSYSTEM WELL-BEING IN ONE HAND AND ITS CONTINUED INTERRUPTION AND DETERIORATION IN ANOTHER HAND INTERACT AND AFFECT HUMAN WELL-BEING FOR MAKING A RESILIENT SOCIETY IN THE FISHING COMMUNITIES. THE EAFM HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE BOTH THE ECOSYSTEM AND HUMAN WELL-BEING IN THE COMING YEARS AS WELL AS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BLUE ECONOMY AND ACHIEVE SOME SDG TARGETS. HOWEVER, HOW THE ECOSYSTEM'S WELL-BEING WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO SOCIAL WELL-BEING WILL DEPEND ON THE EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNANCE, PARTICULARLY MAINTAINING INCLUSIVENESS AND EQUITABLE BENEFIT SHARING AMONG RESOURCE USERS. © 2022",OCMAE,"M.M.

MANAGE.,"TRANSITIONING TO A BLUE ECONOMY THAT PRIORITIZES SOCIAL EQUITY WILL BE CHALLENGING IN OCEAN SECTORS BUT COULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASIER FOR NEWER INDUSTRIES WHERE APPROPRIATE GUIDELINES CAN BE FOLLOWED FROM THE START. WE FOCUS HERE ON TWO EMERGING OCEAN SECTORS—BLUE CARBON AND OCEAN ENERGY—AND AN EVALUATION OF BENEFIT-SHARING AGREEMENTS AT OPERATIONAL SITES, AND THE RECIPIENTS AND TYPES OF THESE BENEFITS. THIS IS AN INITIAL YET USEFUL GAUGE OF PROGRESS TOWARDS INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL EQUITY CONCERNS AS ENVISIONED UNDER A BLUE ECONOMY. THE NUMBER (N = 84) AND SCALE OF OCEAN ENERGY SITES IS RAPIDLY INCREASING BUT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IN A FEW REGIONS. THE OCEAN ENERGY SECTOR IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON SERVING GRIDS IN URBANIZED AREAS AND REDUCING NATIONAL EMISSIONS, AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT-SHARING MECHANISMS WITH LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE LESS COMMON (35% OF ALL SITES). HOWEVER, SOME CASES SHOW HOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN BE BETTER INCLUDED IN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OCEAN ENERGY, INCLUDING NEGOTIATION OF SUBSEQUENT ECONOMIC BENEFITS. DESPITE WIDESPREAD INTEREST IN BLUE CARBON, WE FOUND VERY FEW (N = 4) OPERATIONAL SITES; NONETHELESS, THESE WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH AND OFTEN LED BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES. VOLUNTARY PUBLIC AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACTIONS ARE USEFUL, BUT GOVERNMENT REGULATION MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN REQUIRING EQUITABLE PROCESSES AND SUPPORTING EQUITABLE OUTCOMES, SIMILAR TO NOW-STANDARD ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS TO AVOID NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY. EMERGING OCEAN SECTORS HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE SOCIAL EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN BLUE ECONOMIES, BUT THIS WILL BE MUCH MORE EASILY ACHIEVED IF EQUITY GUIDELINES ARE PRIORITIZED AND MANDATED SO THAT BUSINESS-AS-USUAL PRACTICES DO NOT BECOME ENTRENCHED. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD",OCMAE,"A.M.

MANAGE.,"MARINE ECOTOURISM IS A PIVOTAL SECTOR IN THE BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGIES OF MANY NATIONS AND IS A VITAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FOR PERIPHERAL COASTAL REGIONS AND ISLANDS; YET A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS SOCIOECONOMIC IMPORTANCE REMAINS POORLY QUANTIFIED DUE TO A LACK OF SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE COLLATION. THIS IS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER TRADITIONAL MARINE ACTIVITIES (I.E. COMMERCIAL FISHERIES), WHICH ARE THE TARGET OF MONITORING PROGRAMS THAT SPAN SEVERAL DECADES. THE PAUCITY OF INFORMATION ON MARINE ECOTOURISM AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE OF TRADITIONAL ACTIVITIES IN DECISION-MAKING ARENAS REPRESENT A PRACTICAL IMPEDIMENT TO PROMOTING THE BROADER AGENDA OF BLUE GROWTH AND ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT FOR EUROPE'S REGIONAL SEAS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT OF NON-EXTRACTIVE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH MARINE BIODIVERSITY (I.E. WHALE WATCHING, DIVING AND BIG GAME FISHING) IN ONE OF EUROPE'S OUTERMOST REGIONS: THE AZORES ARCHIPELAGO (NORTHEAST ATLANTIC). DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS OF THE CLIENTS (N = 1740) AND MANAGERS OF MARINE-TOURISM BUSINESSES (N = 49). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IN 2014 APPROXIMATELY 17% OF TOTAL VISITORS TO THE AZORES ENGAGED IN MARINE ECOTOURISM ACTIVITIES GENERATING APPROXIMATELY 80€ MILLION IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY (2.2% OF REGIONAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT). RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT ON AVERAGE A TYPICAL MARINE ECOTOURIST HAS LONGER STAY AND HIGHER EXPENDITURE PATTERN COMPARED TO OTHER VISITORS.

THESE SO-CALLED OCEAN-BASED CLIMATE “SOLUTIONS” OFTEN FALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE “BLUE ECONOMY,” A TERM USED TO REFER TO NEW WAYS OF ORGANIZING OCEAN ECONOMIES TO PROVIDE EQUITABLE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. YET, THUS FAR THE LITERATURE EXPLORING BLUE ECONOMIES AND BLUE ECONOMY GOVERNANCE HAS LARGELY OVERLOOKED OR DOWNPLAYED ITS EQUITY AND JUSTICE ROOTS AND IMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING HOW BLUE ECONOMIES ARE EMBEDDED IN MULTIPLE SCALES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN BLUE ECONOMIES INCLUDE OFFSHORE OIL PRODUCTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO BOTH EMPHASIZE THE NEED AND PROVIDE AN APPROACH TO INCORPORATE JUSTICE AND EQUITY—SPECIFICALLY CLIMATE JUSTICE—INTO BLUE ECONOMY PLANNING AND SCHOLARSHIP. WE BUILD ON CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF BLUE ECONOMIES AS ASSEMBLAGES TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE GLOBAL REACH OF CLIMATE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH OIL THAT ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED OR IGNORED AT SITES OF PRODUCTION AND THROUGH REGIONAL GOVERNANCE. WE ARGUE THAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE LIFE CYCLE OF OIL SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN POLICIES AND PLANNING (INCLUDING BLUE ECONOMY PLANNING) AT SITES OF PRODUCTION, BUT THAT THIS MUST ALSO INCORPORATE UNDERLYING POWER STRUCTURES THAT LEAD TO UNEVEN IMPACTS AND CLIMATE INJUSTICE. WE LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AS A REGIONAL GOVERNANCE TOOL THAT COULD BE USED TO SHAPE OPPORTUNITIES AND OPENINGS TO ORGANIZE BLUE ECONOMIES DIFFERENTLY. TO ILLUSTRATE THESE POINTS, WE LOOK AT HOW ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE PLAYING (AND COULD PLAY) A ROLE IN ENACTING AND SHAPING NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR'S BLUE ECONOMY. © 2022 THE AUTHORS",NA,"L.M.

THE WAY IN WHICH THE BLUE ECONOMY IS CONCEIVED AND UNDERSTOOD DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS DIFFERENT SETS OF ACTORS. A PARTICULAR AREA OF CONTESTATION EXISTS AROUND WHICH OCEAN BASED INDUSTRIES OR SECTORS CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE ‘BLUE’. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY BECOMING A FORUM THROUGH WHICH THE LEGITIMACY OF DIFFERENT PRIVATE USES OF OCEAN RESOURCES IS CONTESTED AND DEBATED. THE QUESTION OF LEGITIMACY OF BLUE ECONOMY ACTIVITIES AND SECTORS IS EXPLORED THROUGH A CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NOTION OF A ‘SOCIAL LICENSE TO OPERATE’ (SLO). WHILST SLO IS NORMALLY CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES OR DEVELOPMENTS, IN THIS ARTICLE WE EXPLORE THE APPLICABILITY OF SLO AT A CROSS-SECTORAL SCALE. IN DOING SO WE EXAMINE HOW THE CONCEPT OF SLO MAY INFORM DEBATES OVER APPROPRIATE PRIVATE USE OF PUBLIC OCEAN RESOURCES, AND HOW THIS MIGHT INFLUENCE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE BROADER CONCEPT OF A BLUE ECONOMY. A CASE STUDY INVOLVING A RANGE OF PRIVATE SECTORS ACTORS ENGAGED IN DIVERSE OCEAN INDUSTRIES WAS CONDUCTED, DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS, A CROSS-SECTORAL SURVEY AND AN INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP WITH THE OCEAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THE CASE STUDY EXPLORES THE ROLE THAT SLO IS CURRENTLY PLAYING IN OCEAN INDUSTRIES. IN PARTICULAR WE EXPLORE PERCEPTIONS OF WHO GRANTS A SLO, WHAT KIND OF CONCERNS IMPACT A SLO AND HOW SECTORS WORK TO OBTAIN, OR MAINTAIN, A SLO. BY COMPARING THE RESPONSES OF INDIVIDUAL SECTORS TO THESE THREE CRITICAL QUESTIONS, WE IDENTIFY THAT MANY OF THE SLO CHALLENGES CURRENTLY BEING EXPERIENCED BY OCEAN INDUSTRIES RELATE TO CONFLICTING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VALUES. THIS IS CREATING A RANGE OF COMPLEX, SOMETIMES IRRESOLVABLE, SLO CHALLENGES FOR MARITIME INDUSTRIES, LARGELY CONCENTRATED IN SECTORS ENGAGED IN RESOURCE EXTRACTION, SUCH AS MINING AND OIL AND GAS. IN ADDITION WE FIND THAT ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS SLO CHALLENGES TO DATE FOCUS MOSTLY ON TECHNICAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS. WHEN COMPARING THIS TO BLUE ECONOMY NARRATIVES WE FIND THAT CURRENT ENGAGEMENT WITH SLO SPEAKS PRIMARILY TO INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY WHICH FAVOUR GROWTH BASED NARRATIVES, AND LARGELY NEGLECT COMPETING DISCOURSES. THIS HAS CONSIDERABLE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OVERALL LEGITIMACY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, AS THE LOSS OF SLO WITHIN ONE SECTOR MAY UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CONCEPT OVERALL.

THE PAPER BEGINS BY PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF BLUE GROWTH AND MULTI-USE IN BLUE GROWTH; BOTH IN POLICY AS WELL AS THE WIDE RANGE OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING OCEAN ENERGY, OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY, OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE AND DESALINATION. THE MARIBE H2020 PROJECT PROVIDES THE VEHICLE FOR THE RESEARCH ELEMENT OF THE PAPER. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION IS A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR SELECTING, FILTERING, DEVELOPING AND RANKING BUSINESS PROPOSITIONS FOR MULTIPLE-USE OF SPACE (MUS) AND MULTI-USE PLATFORMS (MUP). APPLICATION OF THE METHOD FOR THE FIRST TIME IDENTIFIED THREE CASE STUDIES WHERE BLUE GROWTH COMBINATION PROJECTS CAN BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, WITH ATTRACTIVE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRRS). RESULTS PRESENTED FOR THE CASE STUDIES REPORT STANDARD INVESTMENT METRICS AND SHOW THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH PRODUCT (ENERGY, FOOD, WATER) TO THE SYSTEM PROFITABILITY, AS WELL AS SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT. EXISTING COMPANIES WERE FULLY ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS. CO-CREATION BETWEEN SECTOR EXPERTS AND INDUSTRY LED TO BOTH IMPROVED BUSINESS VALUE PROPOSITIONS AND ROBUST ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENT READINESS. IN CONTRAST TO THE PRESUMPTION THAT LARGE SCALE PLATFORMS ARE COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE, THE HIGHEST RANKING CASE STUDY COMPANIES REQUIRED SMALLER CAPITAL EXPENDITURE (CAPEX) AND OPERATED IN NICHE SUBSECTORS. IN CONCLUSION, THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE CASE STUDIES SHOULD PROVIDE CONFIDENCE FOR THE EC AS WELL AS INVESTORS THAT MUS AND MUP HAVE VIABLE ECONOMIC FUTURES LEADING TOWARDS COMMERCIALISATION.

MULTI-PURPOSE PLATFORMS (MPPS) CAN BE DEFINED AS OFFSHORE PLATFORMS SERVING THE NEEDS OF MULTIPLE OFFSHORE INDUSTRIES (ENERGY AND AQUACULTURE), AIM AT EXPLOITING THE SYNERGIES AND MANAGING THE TENSIONS ARISING WHEN CLOSELY CO-LOCATING SYSTEMS FROM THESE INDUSTRIES. DESPITE A NUMBER OF PREVIOUS PROJECTS AIMED AT ASSESSING, FROM A MULTIDISCIPLINARY POINT OF VIEW, THE FEASIBILITY OF MULTIPURPOSE PLATFORMS, IT IS HERE SHOWN THAT THE STATE-OF-THE-ART HAS FOCUSED MAINLY ON SINGLE-PURPOSE DEVICES, AND ADOPTING A SINGLE DISCIPLINE (EITHER ECONOMIC, OR SOCIAL, OR TECHNOLOGICAL, OR ENVIRONMENTAL) APPROACH. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO PROVIDE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STATE OF THE ART REVIEW ON, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, MULTI-PURPOSE PLATFORMS, COMPLEMENTING IT WITH SINGLE-PURPOSE AND/OR SINGLE DISCIPLINE LITERATURE REVIEWS WHEN NOT POSSIBLE. SYNOPTIC TABLES ARE PROVIDED, GIVING AN OVERVIEW OF THE MULTI-PURPOSE PLATFORM CONCEPTS INVESTIGATED, THE NUMERICAL APPROACHES ADOPTED, AND A COMPREHENSIVE SNAPSHOT CLASSIFYING THE REFERENCES DISCUSSED BY INDUSTRY (OFFSHORE RENEWABLES, AQUACULTURE, BOTH) AND BY ASPECT (TECHNOLOGICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC). THE MAJORITY OF THE MULTI-PURPOSE PLATFORM CONCEPTS PROPOSED ARE INTEGRATING ONLY MULTIPLE OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVICES (E.G. HYBRID WIND-WAVE), WITH ONLY FEW INTEGRATING ALSO AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS.

HUMAN PRESSURES FROM RUNOFF, ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIONS, MARINE POLLUTION, FISHING, SHIPPING, MILITARY OPERATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES WEAR ON HABITATS AND POPULATIONS. ECOSYSTEM-BASED MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP) HAS EMERGED WORLDWIDE AS A STRATEGIC INSTRUMENT FOR HANDLING CONFLICTING SPATIAL CLAIMS AMONG COMPETING SECTORS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE TWOFOLD OBJECTIVE OF BOTH BOOSTING THE BLUE ECONOMY AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IS CHALLENGING IN PRACTICE AND MARINE PLANNERS NEED DECISION SUPPORT. CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (CIA) WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE HUMAN IMPRINT ON THE WORLD'S OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS. WE HAVE NOW ADDED A SCENARIO COMPONENT TO THE CIA MODEL AND USED IT WITHIN SWEDISH ECOSYSTEM-BASED MSP. THIS HAS ALLOWED US TO PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FOR DIFFERENT PLANNING ALTERNATIVES THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING PROCESS, STRENGTHENING THE INTEGRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS INTO STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING. EVERY MSP DECISION MAY ENTAIL A LOCAL SHIFT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, CAUSING POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS. THE RESULTS FROM SWEDISH MSP IN THE NORTH SEA AND BALTIC SEA ILLUSTRATE THAT MSP CERTAINLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LOWER NET CUMULATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, BOTH LOCALLY AND ACROSS SEA BASINS, AS LONG AS ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES ARE RATED HIGH AND PREVAILING PRESSURES DERIVE FROM ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF MSP. BY SYNTHESIZING INNUMEROUS DATA INTO COMPREHENSIBLE DECISION SUPPORT THAT INFORMS MARINE PLANNERS OF THE LIKELY ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS, CIA ENABLES ECOSYSTEM-BASED MSP IN PRACTICE. © 2018 THE AUTHORS",STEVA,"L.

THE RESTRICTIONS TAKEN TO SLOW DOWN THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IMPACT SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THESE COVID-19 IMPACTS ON THE OCEAN-HUMAN SYSTEM IS LACKING. THE CURRENT STUDY FILLS THIS GAP BY SYNTHESIZING THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE GLOBAL OCEAN BY CONDUCTING A SYSTEMIC SCOPING REVIEW OF 92 PUBLISHED ARTICLES. FROM A GEOSPATIAL PERSPECTIVE, THE STUDIES COVERED A TOTAL OF 37 COUNTRIES, MAINLY FROM ASIA, EUROPE, AND NORTH AMERICA, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA. FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON GLOBAL OCEANS WERE SUMMARIZED. NOTABLY, IMPROVED COASTAL WATER QUALITY AND REDUCED UNDERWATER NOISE WERE REPORTED. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE INCREASING COVID-19-RELATED MEDICAL WASTE SUCH AS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT LEADS TO SEVERE POLLUTION, WHICH THREATENS THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM AND WILDLIFE. FROM A SOCIOECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC WERE NEGATIVE THROUGHOUT WITH MARINE TOURISM AND THE FISHERY INDUSTRY BEING SEVERELY DISRUPTED. COASTAL COMMUNITIES SUFFERED FROM LOSS OF INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, INEQUALITIES AND HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSFORMATION OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIC PRACTICES IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR OCEAN AND BOOST PROGRESS TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 14 (SDG 14).

THESE PRESSURES ADD TO, AND INTERACT WITH, GLOBAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND WARMING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE COMBINED PRESSURES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE PLANNED CO-LOCATION OF OFFSHORE WIND FARM (OWF) AND AQUACULTURE ZONES ON THE CARBON FLOW THROUGH EPIFAUNAL COMMUNITIES INHABITING WIND TURBINES IN THE NORTH SEA. A 13C-LABELLED PHYTOPLANKTON PULSE-CHASE EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED IN MESOCOSMS (4 M3) HOLDING UNDISTURBED HARD-SUBSTRATE (HS) COMMUNITIES, NATURAL SEDIMENT WITH INFAUNA, AND MOBILE INVERTEBRATE PREDATORS. CARBON ASSIMILATION WAS QUANTIFIED UNDER CURRENT AND PREDICTED FUTURE-CLIMATE CONDITIONS (+3 °C AND −0.3 PH UNITS), AS WELL AS A FUTURE-CLIMATE CO-USE SCENARIO WITH BLUE MUSSEL (MYTILUS EDULIS) AQUACULTURE. CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED AN INCREASE IN MACROFAUNAL CARBON ASSIMILATION AS WELL AS AN ORGANIC ENRICHMENT OF UNDERLYING SEDIMENTS. DYNAMIC (NON-)TROPHIC LINKS BETWEEN M. EDULIS AND OTHER HS EPIFAUNA RESULTED IN SHIFTS AMONG THE SPECIES CONTRIBUTING MOST TO THE PHYTOPLANKTON-DERIVED CARBON FLOW ACROSS CLIMATE SCENARIOS. INCREASED INTER- AND INTRASPECIFIC RESOURCE COMPETITION IN THE PRESENCE OF M. EDULIS AQUACULTURE PREVENTED A LARGE INCREASE IN THE TOTAL ASSIMILATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON BY HS FAUNA. LOWER INDIVIDUAL CARBON ASSIMILATION RATES BY BOTH MUSSELS AND OTHER EPIFAUNA SUGGEST THAT IF FILTER CAPACITY BY HS EPIFAUNA WOULD APPROACH RENEWAL BY ADVECTION/MIXING, M. EDULIS INDIVIDUALS WOULD LIKELY GROW TO A SMALLER-THAN-DESIRED COMMERCIAL SIZE. IN THE SAME SCENARIO, BENTHIC ORGANIC CARBON MINERALISATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BOOSTED DUE TO INCREASED ORGANIC MATTER DEPOSITION BY THE AQUACULTURE SET-UP. COMBINING THESE RESULTS WITH IN SITU OWF ABUNDANCE DATA CONFIRMED M. EDULIS AS THE MOST IMPACTFUL OWF AHS SPECIES IN TERMS OF (TOTAL) CARBON ASSIMILATION AS WELL AS THE DESCRIBED STRESS RESPONSES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ADDITION OF BIVALVE AQUACULTURE. © 2022 THE AUTHORS",STEVA,"J.

WHILE THIS WILL IMPROVE GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY, CONTRIBUTE TO THE BLUE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS LOCALLY, THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE MASSIVE. THE EXISTING LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED INTO THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS WHICH HOST AQUACULTURE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A CHOICE EXPERIMENT SURVEY OF NORWEGIAN HOUSEHOLDS' TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN SALMON PRODUCTION AND JOB CREATION, AND THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT. MOST RESPONDENTS WERE AT THE OUTSET NEUTRAL OR SUPPORTIVE OF PLANS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, WHEN INFORMED ABOUT POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN TERMS OF MARINE PLASTICS AND SALMON LICE AFFECTING WILD SALMON STOCKS, AND ASKED TO TRADE THESE OFF AGAINST THE POSITIVE EFFECTS, THE MAJORITY OPPOSED THE PLANS AND EXPRESSED A POSITIVE WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY TO AVOID THE PLANNED EXPANSION. APPLYING A HYBRID MIXED MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL WE FIND THAT INCOME, EDUCATION AND TO SOME EXTENT AGE, ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES, EXPLAIN MOST OF THE VARIATION IN PEOPLE'S PREFERENCES. SUPPORT FOR LARGE AQUACULTURE EXPANSION IS HIGHER AMONG PEOPLE WHO CONSUME FARMED SALMON FREQUENTLY AND THOSE LIVING IN AREAS WITH A HIGH DENSITY OF AQUACULTURE FARMS. HENCE, WE DO NOT FIND THE SO-CALLED “NOT IN MY BACKYARD” (NIMBY) EFFECT.

THE CORE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER, THE AUTHORS CONTEND, IS THAT CORPORATE FORESIGHT TOOLS, AS APPLIED AT THE LEVEL OF THE ECOSYSTEM, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ORCHESTRATE ECOSYSTEMS. TO THIS END, THE AUTHORS EXAMINE THE PRACTICAL USE OF CORPORATE FORESIGHT TOOLS, IN THIS CASE, ROADMAPPING AND SCENARIO PLANNING, AS EMPLOYED BY ECOPRODIGI, AN INTERREG BALTIC SEA PROJECT DESIGNED TO ADVANCE THE EU'S STRATEGY FOR ECO-EFFICIENT SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY IN THE ROLL-ON/ROLL-OFF (RO-RO) SHIPPING ECOSYSTEM. RESULTS DEMONSTRATE HOW ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL FORESIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERS FROM TRADITIONAL FORESIGHT CENTERED AROUND A FOCAL FIRM. CORPORATE FORESIGHT TOOLS, AS APPLIED TO AN ECOSYSTEM: 1) TARGET A DIVERSE SET OF ECOSYSTEM ACTORS BEYOND THE SEGMENT'S FOCAL FIRM, INCLUDING COMPLEMENTARY FIRMS, INVESTORS, AND NON-MARKET ACTORS; 2) ENGAGE ECOSYSTEM ACTORS, RATHER THAN ONLY THE FOCAL FIRM, IN SHARED STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT BASED ON A DIVERSE MIX OF FORESIGHT TOOLS; AND 3) SERVE TO ORIENT AND REIFY THE ECOSYSTEM BY CHARTING THE COLLECTIVE ANTICIPATION OF INNOVATIONS, POLICIES, ETC., IN A SHARED SET OF FUTURE OPTIONS.

AT THE SAME TIME, A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF GLOBAL MARINE WATER BODIES HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM EUTROPHICATION DUE TO EXCESSIVE NUTRIENT LOADING. THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A VALUABLE PHOSPHORUS SOURCE DUE TO NUTRIENT RICH EUTROPHIC SEAWATER AND SEDIMENT WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY SERVE AS PHOSPHORUS MINES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HENCE, SUSTAINABLE PHOSPHORUS RECOVERY STRATEGIES SHOULD BE ADAPTED FOR MARINE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE PHOSPHORUS FOR THE GROWING MARKET DEMAND AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTROL EUTROPHICATION. IN THIS REVIEW, POSSIBLE SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES FOR PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL AND RECOVERY FROM MARINE ENVIRONMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. BIO-BASED STRATEGIES RELYING ON NATURAL PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE/RELEASE METABOLISM OF LIVING ORGANISMS ARE SUGGESTED AS PROMISING OPTIONS THAT CAN PROVIDE BOTH PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL AND RECOVERY FROM MARINE WATERS FOR ACHIEVING A SUSTAINABLE MARINE ECOSYSTEM. AMONG THEM, THE UTILIZATION OF MICROORGANISMS SEEMS PROMISING TO DEVELOP NOVEL STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH GAP FOR THE TECHNICAL APPLICABILITY OF THESE STRATEGIES IS STILL CONSIDERABLY BIG. THEREFORE, FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON THE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRATEGIES THROUGH LABORATORY AND/OR FIELD STUDIES. COUPLING PHOSPHORUS MINING WITH OTHER VALORISATION PATHWAYS (I.E., METAL RECOVERY, ENERGY PRODUCTION) IS ALSO SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE OVERALL SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY.

CONSIDERING THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY DISCARDS HALF OF ITS FISH-PRODUCT MASS IN THE OCEAN, A PROPER VALORIZATION OF ITS RESIDUES WOULD DECREASE NOT ONLY THE OCEAN CONTAMINATION BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF MARINE RESOURCES AND INCREASE THE SECTOR COMPETITIVENESS. WITH THESE GOALS IN MIND, OCEAN-BASED INDUSTRIES ARE ADOPTING NEW SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION MODELS, SIMILAR TO BIOREFINERIES, WHICH ARE EFFECTIVE FOR WASTE VALORIZATION, NAMELY, CONVERTING LOW-VALUE BIOMASS INTO COMMERCIALLY RELEVANT BY-PRODUCTS. BASED ON A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF AQUATIC FEEDSTOCKS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A MARINE BIOREFINERY CAN BE FUNDAMENTAL TO CONSOLIDATE A ""GREENER""SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED IN GREEN CHEMISTRY.

THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH GENERATING WEALTH FROM OCEAN-RELATED ACTIVITIES WHILE PROTECTING AND SUPPORTING MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. FOR REMOTE COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES, LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS A CHALLENGING BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING MARINE BIODIVERSITY AND MAINTAINING SUSTAINABLE AND DIRECT ACCESS TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT RESULTS OF A STUDY IN THE COASTAL REGION OF SOUTH SULAWESI PROVINCE, INDONESIA IN THE CORAL TRIANGLE. THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES THAT COMMUNITY-BASED ECOTOURISM SUPPORTS SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE RESOURCES AND OFFERS AN ENTRY POINT FOR LOW-RESOURCE COASTAL COMMUNITIES TO TAKE PART IN THE BLUE ECONOMY. COMPLEMENTARY LIVELIHOOD PATHWAYS THAT ENHANCE PRIMARY INCOME AND SUPPORT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PLAY A KEY ROLE. STUDY FINDINGS SHOW THAT THREE KEY AREAS WHERE MULTILATERAL SUPPORT IS MOST NEEDED FOR COMMUNITIES WITH ECOTOURISM ASPIRATIONS ARE: WASTE MANAGEMENT, HOSPITALITY SKILLS, AND MARKET ACCESS. FROM THESE FINDINGS, WE PRESENT A MODEL FOR COMMUNITY-BASED ECOTOURISM IN THE BLUE ECONOMY. THE MODEL DEMONSTRATES IMPORTANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITY, THE LOCAL ECONOMY, AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS, AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE COMMUNITY-BASED ECOTOURISM PLAYS IN CREATING EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR PRESERVING NATURAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE. © 2020, © 2020 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.",NA,"A.

IN EFFORTS AT CALCULATING THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE OCEAN, POLICY-ORIENTED DOCUMENTS SEEK TO UNITE DIVERSE ACTORS AROUND COMMON GOALS. THROUGH THE CALCULATION OF NUMBERS, LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM POLICY VISIONS ARE BEING CRYSTALLIZED. BUT HOW DO SUCH NUMBERS COME INTO BEING IN PRACTICE? THIS ARTICLE INTERROGATES THIS QUESTION WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM THE NORWEGIAN CONTEXT: THE ESTABLISHED POLICY GOAL OF A SO-CALLED ‘FIVE-FOLD INCREASE’ IN MARINE VALUE CREATION IN THE YEAR 2050. WHILE POWERFUL NUMBERS ARE COMMONLY EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED THROUGH THE PROCEDURES OF ‘MECHANICAL OBJECTIVITY’ THAT INVOLVE STRICT QUANTIFICATION AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS, OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS A RATHER DIFFERENT ROUTE TOWARDS A POWERFUL NUMBER: BY LOOSELY COMBINING TOOLS DEVELOPED FOR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, THE NUMBER IS CALCULATED BY, FIRST, OPENLY COMBINING QUALITATIVE AND NARRATIVE OPERATIONS INTO THE CALCULATION AND THEN, NEXT, DECOUPLING QUALITATIVE UNCERTAINTIES FROM THE QUANTIFIED POTENTIAL. THE RESULT IS A CALCULATIVE PROCESS THAT TAKES THE FORM OF WHAT WE SUGGEST TO CALL ‘REFLEXIVE OBJECTIVITY’ AND A POLICY-ORIENTED NUMBER THAT ENCOURAGES RISK-TAKING AND ACTION OVER RESTRAINT AND PRECAUTION. © 2019, © 2019 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.",NA,"H.

FROM A BLUE ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES, INFORMATION ON THE CARBON STORAGE OF KELPS IS IMPORTANT. WE CONDUCT THE FIRST CARBON STORAGE ASSESSMENT OF LESSONIA TRABECULATA IN PERU AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOMASS ESTIMATION MODELS IN ORDER TO MONITOR KELPS USING THE LEAST DESTRUCTIVE METHODOLOGIES. WE CHOSE THREE COMMONLY HARVESTED SITES IN SAN JUAN DE MARCONA TO HAPHAZARDLY EXTRACT LESSONIA TRABECULATA SPOROPHYTES USING TRANSECTS. SPOROPHYTE HEIGHT (M), WET BIOMASS (KG), MAXIMUM (D) AND MINIMUM (D) HOLDFAST DISK WIDTHS (CM) WERE MEASURED IN THE FIELD. IN THE LABORATORY, C CONTENT WAS MEASURED TO CALCULATE THE BEST-FITTING COEFFICIENTS FOR FUTURE ESTIMATIONS BY USING ALLOMETRIC EQUATIONS. INDIVIDUAL BIOMASS WAS BEST ESTIMATED FROM SPOROPHYTE HEIGHT THROUGH A RATIONAL MODEL, WHILE HOLDFAST AREA (ELLIPSE IN CM2) WAS A GOOD PROXY OF BIOMASS WITH A SINUSOIDAL MODEL. THE SOUTHERNMOST, LEAST ACCESSIBLE, AND MOST EXPOSED SITE (ELEFANTE) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER VALUES OF STORED CARBON. WE ESTIMATED A CARBON STANDING STOCK (FROM SPOROPHYTES ONLY) OF 2044 T C IN THESE KELP BEDS.

MOST STUDIES TO DATE ON THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE THUS CONCENTRATED ON THE GREEN ECONOMY AND HOW COUNTRIES COULD HARNESS ITS RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, PERHAPS THE BLUE ECONOMY (I.E., OCEAN RESOURCES) COULD ALSO HELP ACHIEVE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. STUDIES ON THE BLUE ECONOMY ARE CONCEPT NOTES, REPORTS AND LITERATURE REVIEWS ON THE EVOLVING DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT. THEREFORE, WE EXAMINE THE BLUE ECONOMY IN THE CONTEXT OF MARINE COMMUNITIES’ SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT COULD LEAD TO CHANGING PATTERNS IN THE USE OF OCEAN RESOURCES. USING HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA (GHANA LIVING STANDARD SURVEY–GLSS 7) AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS, WE INVESTIGATE THE SOCIOECONOMIC LIVES AND WELFARE OF MARINE COMMUNITIES AMIDST BLUE ECONOMY PRINCIPLES. WE FOUND THAT MOST MARINE HOUSEHOLDS ENJOY A REASONABLY HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING, WHICH BODES WELL FOR BLUE ECONOMY PRINCIPLES AS LIVELIHOOD DIVERSIFICATION COULD REDUCE PRESSURE ON FISHING AS THE ONLY JOB IN THESE COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, WE ALSO FOUND THAT MANY RURAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES HAVE MORE APPALLING SOCIOECONOMIC LIVING CONDITIONS THAN THEIR URBAN COUNTERPARTS, WITH POOR AMENITIES (LIKE TOILET FACILITIES AND WASTE DISPOSAL).

TO BETTER MANAGE OCEAN SECTORS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY INTERACT AND THE RESPECTIVE OUTCOMES OF THESE INTERACTIONS. TO PROVIDE A FIRST COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE SITUATION, WE REVIEW 3187 ARTICLES TO MAP AND ANALYZE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT OCEAN SECTORS AND FIND 93 UNIQUE DIRECT AND 61 INDIRECT INTERACTIONS, OFTEN MEDIATED VIA THE OCEAN ECOSYSTEM. ANALYSIS OF INTERACTION OUTCOMES REVEALS THAT SOME SECTORS COEXIST SYNERGISTICALLY (E.G. RENEWABLE ENERGY, TOURISM), BUT MANY INTERACTIONS ARE ANTAGONISTIC, AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OTHER SECTORS ARE OFTEN INCURRED VIA DEGRADATION OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS THAT OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS ARE FUNDAMENTAL FOR SUPPORTING MANY OCEAN SECTORS, YET 13 OUT OF 14 OCEAN SECTORS HAVE INTERACTIONS RESULTING IN UNIDIRECTIONAL NEGATIVE ECOSYSTEM IMPACT. FISHING, DRILLING, AND SHIPPING ARE HUBS IN THE NETWORK OF OCEAN SECTOR INTERACTIONS, AND ARE INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS. ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS SIGNAL TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN SECTORS. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT THESE TRADEOFFS RELATE TO THE CUMULATIVE NATURE OF MANY ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS INCURRED BY SOME SECTORS, AND THE DIFFERENTIAL POWER OF OCEAN SECTORS TO EXERT THEIR RIGHTS OR DEMANDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OCEAN DOMAIN. THERE ARE ALSO OFTEN TIME LAGS IN HOW IMPACTS MANIFEST. THE OCEAN GOVERNANCE LANDSCAPE IS NOT CURRENTLY WELL-EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THE FULL RANGE OF TRADE-OFFS, AND OPPORTUNITIES, LIKELY TO ARISE IN THE PURSUIT OF A BLUE ECONOMY IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING OCEAN CONTEXT.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS THEMED ARTICLE SET WAS TO BRING TOGETHER CONTRIBUTIONS ON THE BROAD THEME OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS, ADAPTATION, AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES OF MARINE AQUACULTURE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. HERE WE PRESENT 14 PAPERS COVERING A DIVERSE SET OF APPROACHES INCLUDING EXPERIMENTATION, MODELLING, META-ANALYSIS AND REVIEW, AND DISCIPLINES LIKE BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, ECONOMICS, AND ENGINEERING. THESE ARTICLES FOCUS ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED STRESSORS ON THE AQUACULTURE POTENTIAL ITSELF AND ON THE RESULTING ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS (E.G. PARASITISM AND PREDATION), ON PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AND ADAPTATION POTENTIAL OF SPECIES, AND ON MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AQUACULTURE AND VICE VERSA. CONSIDERING THIS, ADAPTATION OF THE AQUACULTURE SECTOR RELIES ON ANTICIPATING THE BIOGEOGRAPHICAL CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES, DETERMINING THEIR POTENTIAL FOR ADAPTATION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING FOR RESISTANCE OR TOLERANCE TO CLIMATE-INDUCED STRESSORS, AND FOSTERING ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE BY MEANS OF CONSERVATION, RESTORATION, OR REMEDIATION.

HOWEVER, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT PLANS ACHIEVE-OR ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE-THESE GOALS IS LIMITED. ONE GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING STEMS FROM QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE METRICS AGAINST WHICH MSP SUCCESS IS MEASURED. EVALUATION CAN BE BASED ON EXPLICITLY STATED OBJECTIVES, OR MIGHT INCLUDE METRICS CORRESPONDING TO BROAD SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL GOALS. THIS PAPER COMPARES ASPIRATIONAL MSP GOALS GLEANED FROM A LITERATURE REVIEW TO THE OBJECTIVES EXTRACTED FROM 50+ FINALIZED AND IMPLEMENTED PLANS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND: (1) HOW WELL THESE TWO GROUPINGS ALIGN, AND (2) IN WHAT WAYS ANY MISALIGNMENT MAY SHAPE MSP EVALUATION. FINDINGS SHOW THAT PLANS PRIORITIZE THE ENVIRONMENT, ECONOMY, AND GOVERNANCE, WHILE OFTEN EXCLUDING OBJECTIVES RELATED TO CULTURAL HERITAGE, HUMAN WELL-BEING, INDIGENOUS RIGHTS, HUMAN SAFETY, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. SOCIAL AND CULTURAL OBJECTIVES HAVE BECOME MORE PREVALENT OVER TIME, YET OVERALL STATED OBJECTIVES REMAIN DISTINCT FROM THEORIZED MSP GOALS. AS INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS AIM TO EXPAND MSP, NARROWING THE GAP BETWEEN HOW IT IS PERCEIVED AND HOW ITS OUTCOMES ARE EVALUATED IS CRITICAL TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE. © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.

KEY BLUE ECONOMY POLICY STATEMENTS AND GOVERNANCE INSTRUMENTS ARE ANALYSED IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE WAY THE BLUE ECONOMY IS BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, WITH REFERENCE TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE COMMONWEALTH BLUE CHARTER. HIGH-LEVEL BLUE ECONOMY OBJECTIVES APPEAR TO PRIORITIZE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES, WITH LIMITED ENGAGEMENT WITH EQUITY OBJECTIVES INCLUDING FOOD SECURITY AND GENDER EQUALITY. BLUE ECONOMY OBJECTIVES ARE PRIMARILY BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED THROUGH A DIVERSE ARRAY OF STRATEGIES, PLANS AND POLICIES WITH LIMITED INFORMATION ON MECHANISMS FOR IMPLEMENTATION.

AN ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL LANDINGS DATA SHOWS THAT AVERAGE FISHING WAGES IN 36%–67% OF COUNTRIES, HOME TO 69%–95% OF FISHERS WORLDWIDE, ARE LIKELY BELOW THEIR NATIONALLY DETERMINED MINIMUM LIVING WAGE (WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR COSTS OF FOOD, SHELTER, CLOTHING, HEALTH AND EDUCATION). FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF ALL FISHERIES IN EVERY COUNTRY WERE PERFECTLY MANAGED TO ACHIEVE THEIR MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE YIELD, A COMMON SUSTAINABILITY TARGET, AVERAGE INCOMES OF FISHERS IN UP TO 49 COUNTRIES—70% OF FISHERS WORLDWIDE—WOULD STILL NOT MEET MINIMUM LIVING WAGES. ACCESS TO DECENT WORK AND LIVELIHOODS ARE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING FOR ALL FISHERFOLK AROUND THE WORLD, AND STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT THEIR WELL-BEING MUST THEREFORE INTEGRATE A MUCH WIDER SET OF PERSPECTIVES, DISCIPLINES AND INSTITUTIONS.

THE CRITERIA WERE CHARACTERISED BY THE USE OF INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE, FIELD DATA, LITERATURE ON BREEDING SITES, MACROINVERTEBRATES DISTRIBUTION, LARVAL AND RELATIVE FISH ABUNDANCES, DIGITISATION, PARTICIPATORY MAPPING, AND PERIODIC SAMPLING. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM TRAWL AND SEINE NET SURVEYS. DIGITISATION AND MAPPING OF THE PROPOSED CONSERVATION SITES WERE CARRIED OUT USING QUANTUM GIS SOFTWARE. PARTICIPATORY PHYSICAL DEMARCATION OF SITES WAS DONE USING BUOYS AND MARKERS. LARVAL AND JUVENILE FISHES WERE DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT IN ALL SEVEN RIVER MOUTHS AND SIX BAYS SURVEYED WITH LITTLE VARIANCE; AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF BREEDING AREAS. ADDITIONALLY, A PREPONDERANCE OF MACROINVERTEBRATES AND HIGH FISH DIVERSITY COMPARED WITH OFFSHORE SITES IN THE LAKE STRENGTHENED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THESE ARE CRITICAL HABITATS FOR SPAWNING AND PREFERRED HABITATS FOR NURSERIES FOR FISH.

OCEAN CLIMATE CHANGE (‘CC’) MODELLING MAY BECOME A KEY DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL FOR MSP, BUT TRADITIONAL MODELLING ANALYSIS AND COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES PREVENT THEIR BROAD UPTAKE. WE EMPLOYED MSP-SPECIFIC OCEAN CLIMATE MODELLING ANALYSES TO INFORM A REAL-LIFE MSP PROCESS; ADDRESSING HOW NATURE CONSERVATION AND FISHERIES COULD BE ADAPTED TO CC. WE FOUND THAT THE CURRENTLY PLANNED DISTRIBUTION OF THESE ACTIVITIES MAY BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE DURING THE POLICY'S IMPLEMENTATION DUE TO CC, LEADING TO A SHORTFALL IN ITS SUSTAINABILITY AND BLUE GROWTH TARGETS. SIGNIFICANT, CLIMATE-DRIVEN ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL SHIFTS IN OCEAN COMPONENTS UNDERPINNING DESIGNATED SITES AND FISHING ACTIVITY WERE ESTIMATED, REFLECTING DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES OF SHIFTS IN BENTHIC VERSUS PELAGIC, AND INSHORE VERSUS OFFSHORE HABITATS. SUPPORTING ADAPTATION, WE THEN IDENTIFIED: CC REFUGIA (AREAS WHERE THE ECOSYSTEM REMAINS WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF ITS PRESENT STATE); CC HOTSPOTS (WHERE CLIMATE DRIVES THE ECOSYSTEM TOWARDS A NEW STATE, INCONSISTENT WITH EACH SECTORS’ PRESENT USE DISTRIBUTION); AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, IDENTIFIED BRIGHT SPOTS (AREAS WHERE OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES DRIVE RANGE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN THE MEDIUM TERM). WE THUS CREATE THE MEANS TO: IDENTIFY WHERE SECTOR-RELEVANT ECOSYSTEM CHANGE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CC; INCORPORATE RESILIENT DELIVERY OF CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT AIMS INTO MSP; AND TO HARNESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLUE GROWTH WHERE THEY EXIST. CAPTURING CC BRIGHT SPOTS ALONGSIDE REFUGIA WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS MAY PRESENT IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS WHILE HELPING SUPPORT THE FISHING SECTOR IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. BY CAPITALIZING ON THE NATURAL DISTRIBUTION OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE WITHIN OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS, SUCH CLIMATE-ADAPTIVE SPATIAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES COULD BE SEEN AS NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF CC ON OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS AND DEPENDENT BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS, PAVING THE WAY FOR CLIMATE-SMART MSP. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

COASTAL FISHERIES IN JAPAN ARE OFTEN IDEALIZED AS ONE OF THE LAST BASTIONS OF RESOURCE CO-MANAGEMENT IN AN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY, WITH LOCAL COOPERATIVES COLLECTIVELY CONTROLLING TERRITORIAL FISHING RIGHTS. HOWEVER, DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE, DECLINING PROFITABILITY, AND DWINDLING RESOURCE STOCKS ARE CHALLENGING THEIR VIABILITY. REFORM OF THE FISHERY LAW, DESIGNED TO STIMULATE NEW GROWTH AND INDUSTRIALIZATION – PARTICULARLY IN AQUACULTURE – INCLUDES THE OPENING UP OF COASTAL FISHERY RESOURCES TO CORPORATE INVESTORS, THE STRENGTHENING OF TOP-DOWN REGULATION, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL FISHING QUOTAS (IQ). THE DESIRE TO BOOST DOMESTIC SEAFOOD PRODUCTION ALSO HAS TO BE SEEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DOUBLE ANXIETY OF HIGH DEPENDENCY ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE FOR FOODSTUFF AND OF JAPAN'S VANISHING RURALITY. THIS EMPHASIS ON PRIVATE CAPITAL AND PRESUPPOSED ECONOMIC AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALITY BUILDS ON THE SAME RATIONALE OF BLUE ECONOMY AND BLUE GROWTH DISCOURSES, WHICH PROMISE FINANCIAL ALONG WITH ECOLOGICAL RETURNS ON LARGE-SCALE INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABLE OCEAN ECONOMIES. GROWTH-ORIENTED REFORM IN JAPAN NOW IMPERILS SUCCESSFUL RESOURCE CO-MANAGEMENT IN COASTAL SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES. ITS ANALYSIS THEREFORE OFFERS DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO THE TRANSFORMATIVE AS WELL AS DISPOSSESSIVE POTENTIAL OF THE GLOBAL PARADIGMATIC SHIFT TOWARDS AN INTENSIFIED INDUSTRIAL EXPLOITATION OF THE OCEANS. THE QUESTION OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS CENTRAL IN THE RE-ALLOCATION OF ACCESS RIGHTS TO OCEAN SPACES AND RESOURCES AND THE RE-ARRANGEMENT OF DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES IN FISHERY GOVERNANCE, AS LOCAL FISHING COMMUNITIES FACE A VERY REAL THREAT OF DISPOSSESSION AND DISEMPOWERMENT.

A MORE HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING AND FRAMING OF WHAT A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY IS, IS REQUIRED TO AVOID PERPETUATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF CONVENTIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. NEW UNDERSTANDINGS OF BLUE ECONOMY WHICH PLACE JUSTICE, RESILIENCE, AND SUSTAINABILITY CENTRALLY ARE REQUIRED IF THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT IS TO RETAIN CREDIBILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF ONGOING CLIMATE DISRUPTIONS, SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, AND THE PROGRESSIVE DEGRADATION OF COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS. THE BLUE ECONOMY NEEDS TO REPRESENT A PRACTICAL, REAL-WORLD SOLUTION TO THESE ISSUES FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES STRIVING FOR SUSTAINABILITY.

THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE GROWTH OF THE BLUE ECONOMY ARE A MATTER OF SOME CONCERN FOR LOCAL PEOPLE WHO MAY EXPERIENCE FEW BENEFITS AND SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS. ONE WAY THAT THESE IMPACTS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY OCCUR IS THROUGH SUBTLE OR OVERT FORMS OF DISPOSSESSION THAT RESULT FROM THE GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGIES AND INFRASTRUCTURES AT SEA OR ON THE LAND (E.G., OFFSHORE OIL RIGS, SHIPS, PORTS, PROCESSING FACILITIES, ETC.). WE FOCUS ON DESALINATION, AN UNDERSTUDIED ASPECT OF THE BLUE ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING EXPONENTIALLY. PROPONENTS HERALD DESALINATION AS A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO INCREASE FRESH WATER SOURCES, WHILE SOLVING SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES LEFT BEHIND BY THE OVERUSE OF NATURAL FRESHWATER. HOWEVER, FAR FROM BEING A SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PANACEA, NEW POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS ARE FUSED TO SUSTAIN THIS TECHNOLOGY WITH IMPACTS FOR BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND LOCAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEW THE LITERATURE AND DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS OF DISPOSSESSION VIA THE BLUE ECONOMY AND APPLY IT TO DESALINATION PROJECTS IN THE ANTOFAGASTA REGION OF CHILE. DRAWING FROM A REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS AND DECLARATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, THE RESEARCH ANALYSES COMMUNITIES' CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF DESALINATION. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED (1) LACK OF MEANINGFUL INCLUSION IN DECISION-MAKING; (2) PHYSICAL DISPLACEMENT OF COMMUNITIES OR FROM AREAS REQUIRED FOR LIVELIHOODS; (3) CONCERNS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS, AND RELATED SOCIAL IMPACTS; AND (4) FEW SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO LOCAL PEOPLE.

IN RESPONSE TO THE LIMITED ATTENTION PAID TO THE SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITABLE GOVERNANCE APPROACHES OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, A US ‘BLUE NEW DEAL’ HAS BEEN PROPOSED AIMING TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE OCEAN AND SUPPORT COASTAL COMMUNITIES' ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE BLUE NEW DEAL EMERGED AS A CENTRAL POLICY PROPOSAL FROM 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ELIZABETH WARREN TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF THE BLUE ECONOMY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THROUGH A JUST TRANSITIONS ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE PROPOSAL FOR A US BLUE NEW DEAL — AS DESIGNED BY SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN — THAT WOULD BE APPLIED TOWARDS ENHANCING SOCIOECONOMIC RESILIENCY, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, AND ADDRESSING SOCIAL INEQUITIES. AS PART OF A CRITICAL POLICY ANALYSIS EVALUATING THE AREAS OF FOCUS WARREN'S BLUE NEW DEAL PRESENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND SUSTAINABILITY ARE CENTRAL TO THE SUCCESS OF MANAGING, AND ENHANCING THE ROLE OF, THE BLUE ECONOMY. THE CHALLENGES FACING THE BLUE NEW DEAL REFLECT A ‘ONE SIZE FITS ALL’ FEDERAL APPROACH THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR ADDRESSING MULTIFACETED OBSTACLES IN KEY SECTORS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, ITS GOVERNANCE, AND TACKLING INTERCONNECTED CRISES THAT EXACERBATE SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUITIES AND VULNERABILITIES OF MARGINALISED COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

J.,"WHILE THE OCEAN SPACE HAS LONG BEEN IGNORED BY SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE PAST 15 YEARS HAVE WITNESSED AN INCREASED INTEREST IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT BY SCHOLARS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY. THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON THE BLUE ECONOMY, ALMOST NON-EXISTENT A FEW YEARS AGO, IS NOW BURGEONING. THE ACADEMIC DEBATE HAS OFFERED SOME CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF BLUE ECONOMY INITIATIVES, BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THE TRUE PLACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WITHIN A BLUE ECONOMY, AND TO PUT PEOPLE AT THE CENTRE OF CONCERNS AND ANALYSES. OF PARTICULAR CONCERN, IS THE AMBIGUITY OF THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT AND THE CONFUSION OVER ITS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, WHICH CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN HARMFUL PRACTICES. AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS THEN HOW SHOULD SOCIAL SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL AND GEOGRAPHERS, SPECIFICALLY, ENGAGE WITH THESE DEBATES, AND IN PARTICULAR HOW SHOULD THE POTENTIAL HUMAN AND SOCIAL COSTS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY BE INVESTIGATED AND ADDRESSED WHILE ASSURING JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS? THE PAPERS PRESENTED HERE SHARE THE VISION THAT ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, JUSTICE AND EQUALITY SHOULD BE AT THE HEART OF THE BLUE ECONOMY; NOT JUST CONCEPTUALLY, BUT PRACTICALLY TOO. THE PAPERS PURSUE EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY BLUE ECONOMY RISKS AND THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH THEY OCCUR; ASSESS THE PLACE OF INCLUSION AND PARTICIPATION IN A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY; DEFINE WHAT BLUE ECONOMY POLICIES SHOULD INCLUDE TO DRIVE JUST AND SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES; AND IDENTIFY WHERE THE DOMINANT UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY AND ITS PRIORITIES ARE COMING FROM. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY PUT CONSIDERATIONS OF JUSTICE AND BROADER CULTURAL STRUCTURES AT THE CENTRE OF THEIR CONCERNS AND ANALYSIS. THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO BYPASS GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES AND GAIN INSIGHTS FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES AND METHODOLOGIES TO GRASP SUCH AN ENCOMPASSING CONCEPT, AND FOSTER NOT JUST A BLUE ECONOMY WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE, BUT A BLUE ECONOMY FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE.

IN 2014, EU MEMBER STATES SET NEW STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AND AMBITIOUS TARGETS OF PRODUCTIONS TO BE MET BY 2020 IN THE THREE SEGMENTS, MARINE FISH, FRESHWATER FISH AND SHELLFISH. A RECENT ASSESSMENT MADE BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CONCLUDES THAT SOME COUNTRIES MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ATTAIN THE ESTABLISHED GOALS AND THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF SUCH STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY THE SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS HAMPERING AQUACULTURE GROWTH IN FRANCE, ITALY AND SPAIN AS WELL AS THE MEASURES ESTABLISHED TO OVERCOME THEM. MOST OF THE IDENTIFIED ISSUES ARE RELATED TO THE SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES, LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMERS, SUGGESTING THAT THIS STILL REPRESENTS AN UNSOLVED ISSUE HAMPERING AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPE.

BLUE GROWTH SUPPORTS THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF THE MARITIME AND MARINE SECTORS AS THE OCEANS AND SEAS ARE ENGINES OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND INNOVATION. THIS ARTICLE UNDERTAKES A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS IN THE TERMS OF BLUE ECONOMY (BE), MARITIME ECONOMY (MAE), OCEAN ECONOMY (OE), MARINE ECONOMY (ME), AND BLUE GROWTH (BG) TO ANALYZE THE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION OF THIS FIELD OF STUDY. ANALYSIS OF THE AUTHORS’ DEFINITIONS OF BE, BG, ME AND OE PROVIDES INTERESTING RELATIONSHIPS DIVIDED INTO SUSTAINABILITY AND GOVERNANCE; ECONOMICS AND ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION; INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND LOCALIZATION; AND THE GROWTH OF THE OCEAN ECONOMY, WITH DEVELOPMENT AS THE CENTRAL AXIS THAT ENCOMPASSES THEM. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION IS TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE BE AND THE CE THROUGH THE KEYWORD STUDY. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ARTICLES AND CITATIONS OVER THE LAST DECADE. THE ARTICLES ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT SECTORS OF BE AND THE INTEREST OF GOVERNMENTS IN PROMOTING IT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR NATIONAL ECONOMIES. USING BIBLIOMETRIC MAPPING TOOLS (VOSVIEWER), IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN CONCEPTS SUCH AS CE AND BE THROUGH THE BG AND TO VISUALIZE TRENDING TOPICS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. NASCENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH TRENDS INCLUDE TERMS SUCH AS SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES, AQUATIC SPECIES, BIOFUEL, GROWTH OF THE COASTAL BE, INTERNATIONALIZATION AND BLUE DEGROWTH (BD), THE LATTER APPROACHES ASPECTS OF BG FROM A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE. CONCLUSIONS: IN CONCLUSION, IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR ALLIANCES BETWEEN THE SECTORS THAT COMPOSE BG WITH THE INCORPORATION OF THE CE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABLE BE IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THROUGH THE KEYWORD ANALYSIS IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BG STRATEGY IS THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE BE AND THE CE. THE CE PRESENTS ITSELF AS A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD MITIGATE TENSIONS BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS WHO SUPPORT BOTH GROWTH AND DEGROWTH POSITIONS. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,"R.M.

THE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE SECTOR OF KENYA CONTRIBUTES APPROXIMATELY 0.8% TO THE COUNTRY'S GDP. MARINE PRODUCTION IS ABOUT 9 000 TONNES PER YEAR. MARINE FINFISH FORM THE BULK OF THE MARINE PRODUCTION, WHILE SHELLFISH (E.G. PRAWNS, LOBSTERS AND CRABS), MOLLUSCS (E.G. OCTOPI AND SQUIDS) ARE UNDEREXPLOITED. THE FISHERY SECTOR HAS THE POTENTIAL OF ABOUT USD 5 BILLION FOR THE BLUE ECONOMY IN KENYA. CRAB FISHERY IN KENYA IS ACTIVE IN SOME AREAS OF THE SOUTH AND NORTH COAST. THE CRAB RESOURCES ALONG THE KENYAN WATERS ARE DIVERSE AND A VARIETY OF SPECIES ARE EDIBLE. THE MOST COMMONLY FISHED CRAB BY ARTISANAL FISHERS IS THE MANGROVE MUD CRAB SCYLLA SERRATA. SEMI-COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FISHERS USUALLY HAVE PORTUNID AND OTHER DEEP SEA CRABS AS BY-CATCH IN TRAWL AND LONGLINE FISHERIES, WHICH IN MANY CASES ARE UNUTILIZED. EXPORTS OF LIVE CRABS HAVE INCREASED OVER THE YEARS, WITH EXPORTS MAINLY TO ASIAN COUNTRIES. EXPORT OF FROZEN CRABS STARTED RECENTLY. THE NEED TO SUSTAINABLY UTILIZE LAKE, RIVER AND OCEAN RESOURCES IS RECOGNIZED AND IMPORTANT IN PROMOTING BLUE ECONOMY. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF CRAB FISHERY PROVIDES A POTENTIAL AREA FOR THE BLUE ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT IN KENYA. RESEARCH IS ESSENTIAL TO CRAB FISHERY DEVELOPMENT.

CHEM.,"THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE PROJECTED RISE IN WORLD POPULATION CALL FOR A GREATLY INCREASED SUPPLY OF MATERIALS CRITICAL FOR IMPLEMENTING CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS RARE EARTH ELEMENTS (REES) AND OTHER RARE METALS. BECAUSE THE DEMAND FOR CRITICAL METALS IS INCREASING AND LAND-BASED MINERAL DEPOSITS ARE BEING DEPLETED, SEAFLOOR RESOURCES ARE SEEN AS THE NEXT FRONTIER FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION. MARINE MINERAL DEPOSITS WITH A GREAT RESOURCE POTENTIAL FOR TRANSITION, RARE, AND CRITICAL METALS INCLUDE MAINLY DEEP-SEA MINERAL DEPOSITS, SUCH AS POLYMETALLIC SULFIDES, POLYMETALLIC NODULES, COBALT-RICH CRUSTS, PHOSPHORITES, AND RARE EARTH ELEMENT-RICH MUDS. MAJOR AREAS WITH ECONOMIC INTEREST FOR SEABED MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING ARE THE FOLLOWING: NODULES IN THE PENRHYN BASIN-COOK ISLANDS EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE (EEZ), THE CLARION-CLIPPERTON NODULE ZONE, PERU BASIN NODULES, AND THE CENTRAL INDIAN OCEAN BASIN; SEAFLOOR MASSIVE SULFIDE DEPOSITS IN THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA, JAPAN, AND NEW ZEALAND AS WELL AS THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE AND THE THREE INDIAN OCEAN SPREADING RIDGES; COBALT-RICH CRUSTS IN THE PACIFIC PRIME CRUST ZONE AND THE CANARY ISLANDS SEAMOUNTS AND THE RIO GRANDE RISE IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN; AND THE RARE EARTH ELEMENT-RICH DEEP-SEA MUDS AROUND MINAMITORISHIMA ISLAND IN THE EQUATORIAL NORTH PACIFIC. IN ADDITION, ZONES FOR MARINE PHOSPHORITES EXPLORATION ARE LOCATED IN CHATHAM RISE, OFFSHORE BAJA CALIFORNIA, AND ON THE SHELF OFF NAMIBIA. MOREOVER, SHALLOW-WATER RESOURCES, LIKE PLACER DEPOSITS, REPRESENT ANOTHER MARINE SOURCE FOR MANY CRITICAL MINERALS, METALS, AND GEMS. THE MAIN CONCERNS OF DEEP-SEA MINING ARE RELATED TO ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF RARE EARTH ELEMENT MINING ON DEEP-SEA ECOSYSTEMS ARE STILL POORLY EVALUATED. FURTHERMORE, MARINE MINING MAY CAUSE CONFLICTS WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS FISHERIES, COMMUNICATIONS CABLE OWNERS, OFFSHORE WIND FARMS, AND TOURISM. THE GLOBAL OCEAN IS AN IMMENSE SOURCE OF FOOD, ENERGY, RAW MATERIALS, CLEAN WATER, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND SUFFERS SERIOUSLY BY MULTIPLE STRESSORS FROM ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY NEEDS A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. BY PROTECTING VULNERABLE AREAS, APPLYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR DEEP-SEA MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING, MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING, AND A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR MINERALS EXTRACTION, WE MAY ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT AND USE OF OUR OCEANS. © 2022 IUPAC & DE GRUYTER.

RES.,"THIS PAPER PRESENTS MAJOR GAPS AND CHALLENGES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE UN DECADE OF OCEAN SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (2021-2030) IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION. THE AUTHORS MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE NEEDS AND CO-DESIGN ACTIONS IDENTIFIED DURING TWO CONSULTATIONS, PART OF THE DECADE PREPARATORY-PHASE, FRAMING THEM IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA’S UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES. ACCORDING TO THE ‘MEDITERRANEAN STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2020’ BY THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME MEDITERRANEAN ACTION PLAN AND DESPITE NOTABLE PROGRESS, THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION IS NOT ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE AND FULLY IMPLEMENT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF AGENDA 2030. KEY FACTORS ARE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE HUMAN-INDUCED PRESSURES THAT THREATEN THE ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES AND SERVICES IN THE GLOBAL CHANGE SCENARIO. THE BASIN, IDENTIFIED AS A CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY HOTSPOT, IS EXPOSED TO POLLUTION AND RISING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS AFFECTS MAINLY THE COASTAL ZONES, AT INCREASING RISK OF EXTREME EVENTS AND THEIR NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF UNSUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF KEY ECONOMIC ASSETS. TRANSITIONING TO A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY IS THE KEY FOR THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT’S HEALTH AND THE NOURISHMENT OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHALLENGING CONTEXT, OFFERING THE OPPORTUNITY OF ENHANCING THE KNOWLEDGE TO DEFINE SCIENCE-BASED MEASURES AS WELL AS NARROWING THE GAPS BETWEEN THE NORTHEN AND SOUTHERN SHORES, CALLS FOR A JOINT (RE)ACTION. THE PAPER REVIEWS THE STATE OF THE ART OF MEDITERRANEAN SEA SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE, SETS OF TRENDS, CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS, SPECIFIC CHALLENGES, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH DECADE’S SOCIETAL OUTCOME. IN THE CONCLUSIONS, THE PROPOSAL FOR A MEDITERRANEAN REGIONAL PROGRAMME IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE OCEAN DECADE IS ADDRESSED. THE CORE OBJECTIVE RELIES ON INTEGRATING AND IMPROVING THE EXISTING OCEAN-KNOWLEDGE, OCEAN LITERACY, AND OCEAN OBSERVING CAPACITIES BUILDING ON INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO REACH THE “MEDITERRANEAN SEA THAT WE WANT”. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.",NA,"L.

POLIT. ECOL.,"WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED BLUE ECONOMY, VARIOUS CONSERVATION FINANCE MECHANISMS AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURES ARE BEING PROPOSED AS A MEANS OF SIMULTANEOUSLY SECURING MARINE BIODIVERSITY AND PROFIT-MAKING. A NOVEL APPROACH THAT IS BEING APPLIED WITHIN THIS NEW CONSERVATION FINANCE FRONTIER IS THE INTEGRATION OF ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION AND INSURANCE. BY SYNTHESIZING RECENT LITERATURES IN POLITICAL ECOLOGY ON THE NOTION OF RENT AND THE BIOPOLITICS OF NATURE, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE INTEGRATION OF ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION AND INSURANCE CAN BE SEEN AS A TECHNIQUE THAT IS MOBILIZED FOR GOVERNING ECOSYSTEM RENTS BIOPOLITICALLY. THE ARTICLE URGES POLITICAL ECOLOGISTS TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW BIOPOLITICS AND GOVERNANCE OF RENTS INTERSECT IN MARKET-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE.WHILE SURVEYING THE BREADTH OF PROJECTS THAT INVOLVES BOTH ADAPTATION AND INSURANCE, I PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO A PARAMETRIC CORAL REEF INSURANCE THAT WAS RECENTLY INTRODUCED IN THE MEXICAN STATE QUINTANA ROO. SUCH A PROJECT, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, INVOLVES RECONCEPTUALIZING THE CORAL REEF AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS – ULTIMATELY RENTS – TO THE LOCAL TOURIST INDUSTRY AND INDIRECTLY THE STATE, BUT THIS CORAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS ITSELF IN NEED OF BEING PROTECTED THROUGH INSURANCE AS A BIOPOLITICAL MEASURE THAT CAN ENSURE THE FUTURE LIFE OF THE CORAL REEF BY RENDERING CALCULABLE UNCERTAIN, FUTURE CLIMATE THREATS TO THE REEF. BY RECONCEPTUALIZING ECOSYSTEMS AS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BE INSURED, THE NOTION OF ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION OPERATIONALIZES OTHERWISE SYSTEMATIC RISKS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS ON A LOCAL SCALE. FINALLY, I HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED WHEN INSURANCE IS USED AS A BIOPOLITICAL MEANS OF MAKING NATURE LIVE. © 2021. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",NA,"J.

THE PURPOSE OF SMART CABLES IS TO SUPPORT CLIMATE AND OCEAN OBSERVATION, SEA LEVEL MONITORING, OBSERVATIONS OF EARTH STRUCTURE, AND TSUNAMI AND EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING AND DISASTER RISK REDUCTION, INCLUDING HAZARD QUANTIFICATION. RECENT ADVANCES INCLUDE REGIONAL SMART PILOT SYSTEMS THAT ARE THE FIRST STEPS TO TRANS-OCEAN AND GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION. EXAMPLES OF PILOTS INCLUDE: INSEA WET DEMONSTRATION PROJECT OFF SICILY AT THE EUROPEAN MULTIDISCIPLINARY SEAFLOOR AND WATER COLUMN OBSERVATORY WESTERN IONIAN FACILITY; NEW CALEDONIA AND VANUATU; FRENCH POLYNESIA NATITUA SOUTH SYSTEM CONNECTING TAHITI TO TUBAUI TO THE SOUTH; INDONESIA STARTING WITH SHORT PILOT SYSTEMS WORKING TOWARD SYSTEMS FOR THE SUMATRA-JAVA MEGATHRUST ZONE; AND THE CAM-2 RING SYSTEM CONNECTING LISBON, AZORES, AND MADEIRA. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES OBSERVING SYSTEM SIMULATIONS FOR THESE AND OTHER REGIONS. FUNDING REFLECTS A BLEND OF GOVERNMENT, DEVELOPMENT BANK, PHILANTHROPIC FOUNDATION, AND COMMERCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS. IN ADDITION TO NOTABLE SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIETAL BENEFITS, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE’S MISSION OF GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY WILL BENEFIT DIRECTLY, AS ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS IMPROVES BOTH THE INTEGRITY OF INDIVIDUAL CABLE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE RESILIENCE OF THE OVERALL GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.

GENET.,"A KEY COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY IS THE SUSTAINABLE EXTRACTION OF MARINE RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH NETWORKS OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS). CONNECTIVITY AND REPRESENTATIVITY ARE ESSENTIAL FACTORS THAT UNDERLIE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF MPA NETWORKS, WHICH CAN SAFEGUARD BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, AND ULTIMATELY SUPPORT THE BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY BY BALANCING OCEAN USE WITH CONSERVATION. NEW “BIG DATA” OMICS APPROACHES, INCLUDING GENOMICS AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS, ARE BECOMING ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF MPA NETWORKS. CURRENT MOLECULAR OMICS TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING POPULATION-SCALE GENOME SEQUENCING, HAVE DIRECT APPLICATIONS FOR ASSESSING POPULATION CONNECTIVITY AND FOR EVALUATING HOW GENETIC VARIATION IS REPRESENTED WITHIN AND AMONG MPAS. EFFECTIVE BASELINE CHARACTERIZATION AND LONG-TERM, SCALABLE, AND COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL MPA MANAGEMENT, AND OMICS APPROACHES HOLD GREAT PROMISE TO CHARACTERIZE THE FULL RANGE OF MARINE LIFE, SPANNING THE MICROBIOME TO MEGAFAUNA ACROSS A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (SHALLOW SEA TO THE DEEP OCEAN). OMICS TOOLS, SUCH AS EDNA METABARCODING CAN PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS FOR BIODIVERSITY MONITORING IN LARGE AND REMOTE CONSERVATION AREAS. HERE WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT OMICS APPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING AND MONITORING, WITH A FOCUS ON METABARCODING, METAGENOMICS, AND POPULATION GENOMICS. EMERGING APPROACHES, INCLUDING WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING, CHARACTERIZATION OF GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE, EPIGENOMICS, AND GENOMIC VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ALSO REVIEWED. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF OMICS TOOLS CAN ENHANCE THE DESIGN, MONITORING, AND MANAGEMENT OF MPAS AND THUS WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN A MODERN AND COMPREHENSIVE BLUE ECONOMY STRATEGY.

MAR. SCI.,"SINCE 2011, WHEN THE FIRST EUROPEAN OCEAN LITERACY (OL) PROJECT WAS LAUNCHED IN PORTUGAL, THE NUMBER OF INITIATIVES ABOUT THIS TOPIC IN EUROPE HAS INCREASED NOTORIOUSLY AND THEIR SCOPE HAS LARGELY WIDENED. THESE INITIATIVES HAVE DRAWN FROM THE SEVEN “OL PRINCIPLES” THAT WERE DEVELOPED BY THE COLLEGE OF EXPLORATION OL NETWORK IN 2005. THEY REPRESENT A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION FOR THE MANY ENDEAVORS THAT ARE AIMING TO ACHIEVE A SOCIETY THAT FULLY UNDERSTANDS THE INFLUENCE OF THEMSELVES – AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A POPULATION – ON THE OCEAN AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE OCEAN ON THEM. OL INITIATIVES THROUGHOUT THE PAST YEARS, GLOBALLY, HAVE RESULTED IN THE PRODUCTION OF COUNTLESS DIDACTIC AND COMMUNICATION RESOURCES THAT REPRESENT A VALUABLE LEGACY FOR NEW ACTIVITIES. THE OL RESEARCH COMMUNITY RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO BUILD UP THE SCOPE OF OL BY REACHING THE WIDER BLUE ECONOMY ACTORS SUCH AS THE MARITIME INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. IT IS HOPED THAT BUILDING OL IN THIS SECTOR WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MARITIME ACTIVITIES. THE ERASMUS+ PROJECT “MATES” AIMS TO ADDRESS THE MARITIME INDUSTRIES’ SKILLS SHORTAGES AND CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE RESILIENT LABOR MARKET. MATES’ HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THROUGH BUILDING OL IN EDUCATIONAL, PROFESSIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO BUILD A LABOR FORCE THAT MATCHES THE SKILLS DEMAND IN THESE SECTORS AND INCREASES THEIR CAPACITY TO UPTAKE NEW KNOWLEDGE. THE MATES PARTNERSHIP WILL EXPLICITLY COMBINE OL AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER BY APPLYING THE “COLUMBUS KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER METHODOLOGY” AS DEVELOPED BY THE H2020-FUNDED COLUMBUS PROJECT. © COPYRIGHT © 2019 FERNÁNDEZ OTERO, BAYLISS-BROWN AND PAPATHANASSIOU.",NA,"R.M.

MAR. SCI.,"THE CONCEPT OF BLUE ECONOMY (BE) IS RECOGNIZED AS CENTRAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THAT INCORPORATES SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATION. HOWEVER, IN AFRICA, MUCH OF THE EMPHASIS ON BE IS PLACED ON ECONOMIC GAINS; AS A RESULT, TRADITIONAL LIVELIHOODS AND SMALL-SCALE LOCAL OPERATIONS ARE OUTCOMPETED BY INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES, WITH LITTLE OR NO REGARD FOR SOCIAL INCLUSION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE ARGUE THAT SUCCESSFUL BE INITIATIVES IN AFRICA ACCENTUATE THE INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND PROMOTE SUSTENANCE OF THE NATURAL ECOSYSTEM. WE DEFINE SUCCESS IN TERMS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY BALANCE AMONG ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS. DRAWING ON EXTENSIVE EXPERT EXPERIENCES, OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND LITERATURE REVIEW OF CASE STUDIES ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT, WE HIGHLIGHT TWO CRITICAL FINDINGS. FIRST, LARGE SCALE BE INITIATIVES PRIORITIZE ECONOMIC GAINS AT THE EXPENSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND THE EXCLUSION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SECOND, USING THE FULL SPECTRUM SUSTAINABILITY (FSS) EVALUATION, WE SHOW THAT SUCCESSFUL BE INTERVENTIONS CONSIDERED ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIO-CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVES.

ALTHOUGH RESTORATION STRATEGIES SUCH AS ASSISTED EVOLUTION HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PROPOSED TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF CORAL REEF POPULATIONS IN RESPONSE TO CURRENT AND FUTURE STRESSORS, SCALABILITY OF THESE CONCEPTS AND IMPLEMENTATION IN HABITAT OR ECOSYSTEM-WIDE MANAGEMENT REMAINS A MAJOR LIMITATION FOR LOGISTICAL AND FINANCIAL REASONS. WE PROPOSE TO IMPLEMENT THESE RESTORATION EFFORTS INTO AN ECOTOURISM APPROACH THAT EMBEDS LAND-BASED CORAL GARDENING EFFORTS AS ARCHITECTURAL LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS TO ENHANCE AND BEAUTIFY COASTAL DEVELOPMENT SITES, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL VALUE AND RATIONALE FOR ECOTOURISM STAKEHOLDERS TO INVEST. OUR APPROACH EXTENDS AND COMPLEMENTS EXISTING CONCEPTS INTEGRATING CORAL REEF RESTORATION IN ECOTOURISM PROJECTS BY CREATING A PARTICIPATORY PLATFORM THAT CAN BE EXPERIENCED BY THE PUBLIC, WHILE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING NUMEROUS RESTORATION TECHNIQUES, AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LONG-TERM RESTORATION AND MONITORING STUDIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE DISCUSS OPTIONS FOR PRE-SELECTION OF CORALS AND SYSTEMATIC, LARGE-SCALE MONITORING OF CORAL GENOTYPE PERFORMANCE TARGETING HIGHER RESILIENCE TO FUTURE STRESSORS. TO REDUCE OPERATING COSTS DURING OUT-PLANTING, WE SUGGEST TO CREATE CORAL SEEDING HUBS, CLUSTERS OF CLOSELY TRANSPLANTED CONSPECIFICS, TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY RESTORE/ENHANCE ACTIVE REPRODUCTION. WE DISCUSS OUR LAND-BASED CORAL GARDENING APPROACH IN THE CONTEXT OF POSITIVE IMPACTS BEYOND REEF RESTORATION.

THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) DECLARED 2021–2030 AS THE UN DECADE OF OCEAN SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE ROADMAP FOR THE OCEAN DECADE AIMS TO ACHIEVE SIX CRITICAL SOCIETAL OUTCOMES (SOS) BY 2030, THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF FOUR OBJECTIVES (OS). IT SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZES THE SCARCITY OF BIOLOGICAL DATA FOR DEEP-SEA BIOMES, AND CHALLENGES THE GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF DEEP-SEA ECOSYSTEMS TO INFORM SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE MAP FOUR KEY SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY TO THE OCEAN DECADE SOS: (I) WHAT IS THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE IN THE DEEP OCEAN? (II) HOW ARE POPULATIONS AND HABITATS CONNECTED? (III) WHAT IS THE ROLE OF LIVING ORGANISMS IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION AND SERVICE PROVISION? AND (IV) HOW DO SPECIES, COMMUNITIES, AND ECOSYSTEMS RESPOND TO DISTURBANCE? WE THEN CONSIDER THE DESIGN OF A GLOBAL-SCALE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS BY REVIEWING KEY DRIVERS OF ECOLOGICAL PATTERN AND PROCESS. WE RECOMMEND USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA TO STRATIFY A GLOBAL SURVEY DESIGN: BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGION, DEPTH, HORIZONTAL DISTANCE, SUBSTRATE TYPE, HIGH AND LOW CLIMATE HAZARD, FISHED/UNFISHED, NEAR/FAR FROM SOURCES OF POLLUTION, LICENSED/PROTECTED FROM INDUSTRY ACTIVITIES. WE CONSIDER BOTH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SURVEYS, AND EMPHASIZE NEW BIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTION THAT PRIORITIZES SOUTHERN AND POLAR LATITUDES, DEEPER (> 2000 M) DEPTHS, AND MIDWATER ENVIRONMENTS. WE PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON OBSERVATIONAL, EXPERIMENTAL, AND MONITORING NEEDS FOR DIFFERENT BENTHIC AND PELAGIC ECOSYSTEMS. WE THEN REVIEW RECENT EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE BIOLOGICAL DATA AND SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND ARCHIVING, MAKING “SAMPLING DESIGN TO KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION” RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF A NEW GLOBAL PROGRAM. WE ALSO REVIEW AND COMMENT ON NEEDS, AND RECOMMEND ACTIONS, TO DEVELOP CAPACITY IN DEEP-SEA RESEARCH; AND THE ROLE OF INCLUSIVITY - FROM ACCESSING INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TO THE SHARING OF TECHNOLOGIES - AS PART OF SUCH A GLOBAL PROGRAM.

SURROUNDED BY DESERTS ON ALL SIDES, THE RED SEA IS SUBJECTED TO HIGH DUST INPUTS AND RECEIVES VERY LITTLE FRESHWATER INPUT, AND SO HARBORS A HIGH SALINITY. CORAL REEFS, SEAGRASS MEADOWS, AND MANGROVES FLOURISH IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO THE BORDERING COASTLINES AND COUNTRIES. INTERESTINGLY, WHILE CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING RAPID DECLINE ON A GLOBAL SCALE, THOSE IN THE RED SEA APPEAR TO BE IN RELATIVELY BETTER SHAPE. THAT SAID, THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT IMMUNE TO THE STRESSORS THAT CAUSE DEGRADATION, SUCH AS INCREASING OCEAN TEMPERATURE, ACIDIFICATION AND POLLUTION. IN MANY REGIONS, ECOSYSTEMS ARE ALREADY SEVERELY DETERIORATING AND ARE FURTHER THREATENED BY INCREASING POPULATION PRESSURE AND LARGE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. DEGRADATION OF THESE MARINE HABITATS WILL LEAD TO ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC LOSSES. THEREFORE, IT WILL RESULT IN A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BORDERING COUNTRIES TO DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY AND INTEGRATE INNOVATIVE NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS. RECOGNIZING THAT SECURING THE RED SEA ECOSYSTEMS’ FUTURE MUST OCCUR IN SYNERGY WITH CONTINUED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, WE DEVELOPED AN ACTION PLAN FOR THE CONSERVATION, RESTORATION, AND GROWTH OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE RED SEA. WE THEN INVESTIGATED THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES FOR FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC INVESTMENT THAT MAY INCENTIVIZE THESE ACTIVITIES. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A SET OF COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, ECOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH CAN, IF IMPLEMENTED STRATEGICALLY, HELP ENSURE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS WHILE PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION.

MAR. SCI.,"A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS (CBA) IS DESCRIBED FOR A NOVEL WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS (WEC) DESIGN BASED ON A MARINE HYBRID BIO-STRUCTURE—A COMBINATION OF MACROALGAE, SHELLFISH OR OTHER SPECIES ON A BUILT FRAME. THE BIO-OSCILLATOR DESIGN UTILISES A HARD “SKELETON” (E.G., CARBON FIBRE, WOOD) ON WHICH BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS (E.G., SHELLFISH, LARGE MACROALGAE) ARE GROWN. AS WAVES PASS BY, THE LOAD GENERATED BY THE OSCILLATING DRAG AND INERTIA IS TRANSFERRED THROUGH MOORING LINES TO POWER TAKEOFF TECHNOLOGY. THIS NOVEL APPROACH ESSENTIALLY REVERSES THE TYPICAL MARINE ENGINEERING VIEW THAT “BIO-FOULING IS BAD” AND INSTEAD LEVERAGES OFF THE ADDED-DRAG OF BIOLOGICAL GROWTH ON STRUCTURES. THE APPROACH RESULTS IN A STRUCTURE THAT IS LARGELY BIODEGRADABLE, NATURALLY SELF-REPLICATING AND SYNERGISTIC WITH THE BACKGROUND ENVIRONMENT, SELF-DE-RISKING IN TERMS OF FAILURE IMPACT AND CAN LEVERAGE OFF ITS OWN FORM TO ENHANCE ENERGY CAPTURE BEYOND A CONVENTIONAL DESIGN. THIS REDUCES IMPACT WHILE CONNECTING WITH CONVENTIONAL MARINE INDUSTRIES SUCH AS AQUACULTURE. A CBA EXAMINES THE ECONOMIC PROS AND CONS OF THIS APPROACH, FOCUSING ON INSTALLATION AND MATERIAL COSTS, ALONG WITH BENEFITS FROM SYNERGISTIC PRODUCTION. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT IN ADDITION TO TYPICAL WAVE ENERGY OBSTACLES (E.G., CABLE LENGTH, CAPTURE WIDTH, AND POWER TAKE OFF) THE BENEFITS (BIODEGRADABILITY, HARVESTABILITY, AND CARBON REDUCTION) OF REPLACING MUCH OF THE MASS OF THE STRUCTURE WITH LIVING BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL CAN BE INCLUDED. © COPYRIGHT © 2021 HILDEBRAND, FISCHER, RELANO, GORMAN AND STEVENS.",NA,"C.

COMPLETE REMOVAL OF SUBSEA STRUCTURES IS OFTEN THE DEFAULT APPROACH ALTHOUGH SOME REGIONS RETAIN STRUCTURES UNDER RIGS-TO-REEFS PROGRAMS. HERE, WE REVIEWED THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE TO UNDERSTAND THE STATUS OF GLOBAL RESEARCH ON DECOMMISSIONING, AND SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY GAPS IN ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE. WE ESTIMATED THE FREQUENCY OF DIFFERENT RESEARCH CATEGORIES (I.E., THEMES, AND SPATIAL/TEMPORAL SCALES), AND TESTED THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE NUMBER OF PAPERS ACROSS THE CATEGORIES OF EACH RESEARCH ASPECT WAS EVEN IN DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER, THE FREQUENCY OF STUDIES FOCUSING ON BIODIVERSITY AT A LOCAL (≤100 KM2) SCALE (RELATIVE TO REGIONAL AND OCEANIC AND PAN-OCEANIC SCALES) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER; WHILE OTHER THEME CATEGORIES (E.G., ECO-TOXICOLOGY, CONNECTIVITY, STRUCTURAL-INTEGRITY, RESTORATION AND OTHER) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN EXPECTED. TEMPORALLY, ≤1-YEAR STUDIES WERE MORE FREQUENT THAN MULTI-YEAR STUDIES, BUT THESE FREQUENCIES DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE FROM THE ASSUMED DISTRIBUTION OF EQUAL FREQUENCIES. WE PROPOSE THAT FURTHER RESEARCH BE CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE BENEFITS OF BOTH RETENTION AND REMOVAL OF STRUCTURES. ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON DECOMMISSIONING SHOULD EXTEND ITS FOCUS BEYOND BIODIVERSITY, TO INCLUDE ECO-TOXICOLOGY, STRUCTURAL-INTEGRITY, CONNECTIVITY AT LARGER SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES.

MAR. SCI.,"FOR OVER TWO DECADES, THE COUNTRIES, SUBREGIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WIDER CARIBBEAN REGION (WCR) HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN AN INITIATIVE TO IMPLEMENT A REGIONAL GOVERNANCE APPROACH FOR MANAGING THE SHARED LIVING MARINE RESOURCES OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA AND ADJACENT REGIONS. GIVEN THE INHERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE REGION, THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERCONNECTED NATURE OF SHARED ECOSYSTEM GOODS AND SERVICES UPON WHICH COUNTRIES IN THE REGION DEPEND. THIS PAPER USES A RETROSPECTIVE LENS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE CHALLENGES CONFRONTING THE REGION AND ITS EFFORTS TO OVERCOME THEM. IT IS BASED ON THE LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEM GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE WCR IN 2006 AND CHARACTERIZED AS “LEARNING BY DOING.” DATA WERE OBTAINED FOR THIS STUDY THROUGH DESKTOP REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE DOCUMENTING PROGRESS OVER THE PERIOD 2001–2021 AND INSIGHTS REQUESTED FROM 15 KEY INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTRIBUTORS INVOLVED IN THE INITIATIVE. WHILE THE LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES WAS AN UNDERPINNING AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUE, KEY CONSTRAINTS IDENTIFIED WERE CATEGORIZED AS INSTITUTIONAL, CAPACITY BUILDING, AWARENESS RAISING, LEADERSHIP, LEGAL, POLITICAL, SOCIAL CAPITAL, OR SOCIO-CULTURAL. THEY INCLUDE NATIONAL CAPACITY TO ENGAGE WITH REGIONAL LEVEL PROCESSES DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING FUNDING, POLITICAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES OF DEVELOPING A REGIONAL COORDINATION MECHANISM, ENGAGING THE BROADER OCEAN COMMUNITY TO CREATE THE CRITICAL MASS NEEDED, THE DIFFICULTY OF MAINSTREAMING OCEAN AFFAIRS INTO HIGH LEVEL POLITICAL AND DECISION-MAKING FORA AND THE SCARCITY OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL CHAMPIONS.

MAR. SCI.,"RENEWABLE ENERGY, SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD, AND A HEALTHY MARINE ECOSYSTEM ARE INTEGRAL ELEMENTS OF A SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY. THE RAPID GLOBAL ADVANCEMENT OF OFFSHORE WIND COUPLED WITH ITS POTENTIAL TO AFFECT MARINE LIFE COMPELS AN URGENT NEED FOR ROBUST METHODOLOGIES TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF THIS INDUSTRY ON FISHERIES RESOURCE SPECIES. BASIC BEFORE-AFTER-CONTROL-IMPACT (BACI) AND CONTROL-IMPACT (CI) DESIGNS ARE THE MOST COMMON EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS USED TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT ON FISHERIES RESOURCES. THESE DESIGNS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY WHICH PRESENTS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT IMPACT GRADIENTS OCCUR AT WIND FARMS, WITH LARGER EFFECT SIZES CLOSE TO TURBINE FOUNDATIONS THAT ATTENUATE WITH INCREASING DISTANCE. COMBINING THE BEFORE-AFTER SAMPLING DESIGN WITH DISTANCE-BASED METHODS COULD PROVIDE A POWERFUL APPROACH FOR CHARACTERIZING BOTH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIANCE ASSOCIATED WITH WIND DEVELOPMENT. TOWARD ENHANCING FUTURE MONITORING DESIGNS FOR FISHERIES RESOURCE SPECIES AT OFFSHORE WIND FARMS, THIS PAPER AIMS TO: (1) EXAMINE DISTANCE-BASED SAMPLING METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN OR COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO STUDY IMPACTS ON FISHERIES RESOURCES AT OFFSHORE WIND FARMS INCLUDING DISTANCE-STRATIFIED BACI, DISTANCE-STRATIFIED CI, BEFORE-AFTER-GRADIENT (BAG), AND AFTER-GRADIENT (AG) METHODS; (2) SYNTHESIZE THE METHODS AND FINDINGS OF STUDIES CONDUCTED TO DATE THAT HAVE USED DISTANCE-BASED METHODS TO EXAMINE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT FOR BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES, FINFISH, BIRDS, AND SMALL MAMMALS; (3) EXAMINE SOME OF THE CENTRAL METHODOLOGICAL ELEMENTS AND ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN DEVELOPING DISTANCE-BASED IMPACT STUDIES; AND (4) OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO INCORPORATE DISTANCE-BASED SAMPLING METHODS INTO MONITORING PLANS AT OFFSHORE WIND FARMS. © COPYRIGHT © 2021 METHRATTA.",NA,"E.T.

BY DEVELOPING WHAT WAS CALLED INTEGRATED MARITIME POLICY, THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO COORDINATE DIFFERENT SECTORIAL POLICIES AND THUS ADDING VALUE, THROUGH SYNERGIES AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. AT THE SAME TIME, AND AS A RESULT OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, FIVE STRATEGIC SECTORS WITH GREAT GROWTH POTENTIAL WERE IDENTIFIED: AQUACULTURE, RENEWABLE ENERGIES, BLUE BIOTECHNOLOGY, DEEP SEA MINING, AND NAUTICAL TOURISM. THESE WERE THE PILLARS FOR THE BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY, LEADING TO MORE JOBS AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS TREND QUICKLY SPREAD TO OTHER CONTINENTS, UNIVERSALISING THE CONCEPT OF BLUE GROWTH. HOWEVER, THE GROWING COMPETITION FOR MARITIME SPACE, DUE TO NEW USES, LED TO THE REALISATION THAT ALONG WITH THE NEED TO ENSURE CONFIDENCE AND STABILITY FOR INVESTORS, IT WOULD BE IMPERATIVE TO DEVELOP NEW PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS FOR THESE SPACES. DURING THIS PROCESS, GOVERNMENTS QUICKLY REALISED THAT THIS EVOLUTION, WHICH HAD THE POTENTIAL FOR FAR REACHING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS, REQUIRED A NEW INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ADAPTED TO THIS NEW REALITY, WHICH WOULD END UP HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE GOVERNMENTS STRUCTURE ITSELF. WE HAVE WITNESSED, PARTICULARLY DURING THE LAST DECADE, A PROFOUND CONCEPTUAL CHANGE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF MARITIME SPACE. THE DESIGN OF NEW POLITICAL, LEGAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND GOVERNMENTAL FRAMEWORKS, WHICH ARE INTRODUCING A NEW MODEL OF MARITIME AND MARINE GOVERNANCE AT A GLOBAL SCALE, ARE PROBABLY THE MOST CRITICAL ONE SINCE WORLD WAR II.

AN OVERVIEW OF SOME BRAZILIAN INITIATIVES IS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER, INVOLVING UNIVERSITIES, PRIVATE COMPANIES, FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, COVERING INSTITUTIONS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH OF BRAZIL. ALTHOUGH THESE INITIATIVES FOCUS MAINLY ON OCEAN PHYSICS, INTEGRATED EFFORTS CAN EXTEND THE SCOPE TO INCLUDE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND MARINE BIODIVERSITY, HELPING TO ADDRESS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS. EXISTING INITIATIVES CAN BE CONNECTED, AND NEW ONES FOSTERED, TO FILL IN THE GAPS OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL COVERAGE OF OCEAN MONITORING IN THE VAST OCEANIC AREA UNDER BRAZILIAN JURISDICTION (NATIONALLY REFERRED TO AS THE BLUE AMAZON, IN REFERENCE TO THE SIMILAR RICHNESS OF THE AMAZON FOREST). THE ALIGNMENT AMONG NATIONAL AND REGIONAL INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS WITH INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS, CAN BE PROMOTED IF COORDINATED BY A NATIONAL-LEVEL ORGANIZATION, MAXIMIZING THE RETURN OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS. IN LIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES, POSSIBLE FUTURE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED, LEVERAGING FROM EXISTING NATIONAL PUBLIC POLICIES AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION THAT BRAZIL IS TAKING PART.

MAR. SCI.,"THIS WORK IS THE RESULT OF AN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE MAIN IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON MARINE RECREATIONAL FISHING. CHANGES WERE ASSESSED ON (1) ACCESS TO FISHING, DERIVED FROM LOCKDOWNS AND OTHER MOBILITY RESTRICTIONS; (2) ECOSYSTEMS, BECAUSE OF ALTERATIONS IN FISHING INTENSITY AND HUMAN PRESENCE; (3) THE BLUE ECONOMY, DERIVED FROM ALTERATIONS IN THE INVESTMENTS AND EXPENSES OF THE FISHERS; AND (4) SOCIETY, IN RELATION TO VARIATIONS IN FISHERS’ HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. FOR THIS, A CONSULTATION WITH EXPERTS FROM 16 COUNTRIES WAS CARRIED OUT, AS WELL AS AN INTERNATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY AIMED AT RECREATIONAL FISHERS, THAT INCLUDED SPECIFIC QUESTIONS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE FISHERS’ HETEROGENEITY IN RELATION TO BEHAVIOR, SKILLS AND KNOW-HOW, AND VITAL INVOLVEMENT. FISHERS’ PARTICIPATION IN THE ONLINE SURVEY (5,998 RECREATIONAL FISHERS IN 15 COUNTRIES) WAS PROMOTED THROUGH A MARKETING CAMPAIGN. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FISHERS’ CLUSTERING PROCEDURE, BASED ON THE CAPTURED HETEROGENEITY, WAS EVALUATED BY SIMPER ANALYSIS AND BY GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS FROM THE EXPERT CONSULTATION HIGHLIGHTED A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION IN MARINE RECREATIONAL FISHING ACTIVITY. LOWER HUMAN-DRIVEN PRESSURES ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE SOME BENEFITS FOR MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. HOWEVER, EXPERTS ALSO IDENTIFIED HIGH NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE BLUE ECONOMY, AS WELL AS ON FISHER HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF RECREATIONAL FISHING OPPORTUNITIES. MOST (98%) OF THE FISHERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ONLINE SURVEY WERE IDENTIFIED AS ADVANCED, SHOWING A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE OF COMMITMENT TO RECREATIONAL FISHING THAN BASIC FISHERS (2%). ADVANCED FISHERS WERE, IN GENERAL, MORE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19, REPORTING HIGHER REDUCTIONS IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FISH CONSUMPTION, AS WELL AS POORER QUALITY OF NIGHT REST, FOUL MOOD, AND RAISED MORE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH STATUS. CONTROLLED AND SAFE ACCESS TO MARINE RECREATIONAL FISHERIES DURING PANDEMICS WOULD PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE AND REDUCE NEGATIVE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS, ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE SOCIAL GROUPS.

MAR. SCI.,"BLUE GROWTH HAS BECOME ONE OF THE KEY TOPICS OF OCEAN MANAGEMENT. IT IS DEFINED AS A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF OCEAN-RELATED ACTIVITIES WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. CAPTURE FISHERIES ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH POTENTIAL AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION’S BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY. IN OUR REVIEW, WE, HOWEVER, ARGUE THAT CAPTURE FISHERIES SHOULD PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN NATIONAL BLUE GROWTH STRATEGIES. WE IDENTIFIED TWO INTERCONNECTED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO FOSTER BLUE GROWTH IN FISHERIES, A) THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA (CDQ) SYSTEMS AND B) THE SUPPORT OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSF). THEY HOLD THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT FISHERY-DEPENDENT COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND THEREFORE COUNTERACT CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE FISHING SECTOR. ADDITIONALLY, THEY PROVIDE THE POSSIBILITY TO IMPROVE QUOTA ACCESS FOR SMALL-SCALE FISHERMEN. BESIDES HAVING BETTER ACCESS TO QUOTA, THE FUTURE OF SSF DEPENDS ON SOURCES OF PUBLIC FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENT AND INNOVATION AS WELL AS INCREASED REPRESENTATION IN THE MANAGEMENT. IN THIS PERSPECTIVE, WE PRESENT DIFFERENT CASES THAT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED CDQS (THE ALASKA POLLOCK FISHERY) OR HAVE CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO IMPLEMENT CDQ PROGRAMS OR IMPROVE THEIR CURRENT APPROACHES (UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, AND ICELAND). WE FURTHER DISCUSS EXAMPLES FOR SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT SSF DIRECTLY. IF THESE ASPECTS ARE CONSIDERED IN A BLUE GROWTH STRATEGY, THE SURVIVAL OF FISHERY-DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES COULD BE ASSURED, AND SSF COULD DEVELOP FROM PREDOMINANTLY PART-TIME OR SUBSISTENCE FISHERIES TO A FULL-TIME OCCUPATION. BY THOSE MEANS, THEY WOULD BE PART OF A FOSTERING BLUE ECONOMY AND STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE FISHING PRACTICES IN EUROPE.

THE GOAL OF BIO-GO-SHIP IS TO PRODUCE SYSTEMATIC AND CONSISTENT BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS DURING GLOBAL OCEAN REPEAT HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE PLANKTONIC ECOSYSTEM. OCEAN PLANKTON ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE EARTH CLIMATE SYSTEM, FORM THE BASE OF THE OCEANIC FOOD WEB AND THEREBY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INFLUENCING FOOD SECURITY AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE BLUE ECONOMY. DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE, OCEAN BIOLOGY IS LARGELY UNDER-SAMPLED IN TIME AND SPACE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES. THIS LACK OF INFORMATION HAMPERS OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF PLANKTON IN REGULATING BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND FUELING HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS, NOW AND IN FUTURE OCEAN CONDITIONS. TRADITIONALLY, MANY OF THE METHODS USED TO QUANTIFY BIOLOGICAL AND ECOSYSTEM ESSENTIAL OCEAN VARIABLES (EOVS), MEASURES THAT PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ON THE ECOSYSTEM, HAVE BEEN EXPENSIVE AND LABOR- AND TIME-INTENSIVE, LIMITING THEIR LARGE-SCALE DEPLOYMENT. IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND MATURED, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO GREATLY EXPAND OUR BIOLOGICAL OCEAN OBSERVING CAPACITY. THESE TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING CELL IMAGING, BIO-OPTICAL SENSORS AND 'OMIC TOOLS, CAN BE COMBINED TO PROVIDE OVERLAPPING MEASUREMENTS OF KEY BIOLOGICAL AND ECOSYSTEM EOVS. NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DATA MANAGEMENT AND OPEN SHARING CAN FACILITATE MEANINGFUL SYNTHESIS AND INTEGRATION WITH CONCURRENT PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA.

MAR. SCI.,"MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS) ARE ESSENTIAL TO REACH THE UN OCEAN’S DECADE CHALLENGES AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 14 (LIFE BELLOW WATER – CONSERVE COASTAL AND MARINE AREAS), AND THEIR CRUCIAL ROLE FOR THE HEALTH OF THE PLANET WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE UNITED NATIONS OCEAN CONFERENCE. HOWEVER, OFTEN THESE MPA’S ARE NO MORE THAN PAPER PARKS, WITH POOR FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES, THUS LACKING EFFECTIVENESS. MOREOVER, THEY FREQUENTLY TRIGGER CONFLICTS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES, BY IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS TO THEIR ACTIVITIES WITH NO ALTERNATIVE OR COMPENSATIONS, CAUSING SERIOUS GOVERNANCE INEFFICIENCIES. THUS, WITHIN THE UN OCEANS DECADE, MPA’S MUST FACE SIMULTANEOUSLY THREE OF THE CHALLENGES: PROTECT AND RESTORE ECOSYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY (CHALLENGE 2); DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE OCEAN ECONOMY (CHALLENGE 4) AND CHANGE HUMANITY’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OCEAN (CHALLENGE 10). TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT MANAGEMENT MODELS OF MPA’S HAD TO FIND WAYS TO VALUE NATURAL CAPITAL AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INVOLVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE GOVERNANCE PROCESSES. THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY HAS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR MANY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, NAMELY TOURISM, BEING ECOTOURISM CONSIDERED ONE OF THE SEGMENTS PARTICULARLY ADEQUATE TO VALUE NATURAL CAPITAL. ECOTOURISM, DEFINED AS “ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL AND VISITATION TO RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED NATURAL AREAS”, TO ENJOY AND APPRECIATE NATURE, IS OFTEN USED TO ENHANCE THE NATURAL CAPITAL, WHILE PROTECTING AND PROMOTING PROTECTED AREAS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT ABOUT ECOTOURISM IN MPA’S ALL OVER THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ANALYZED SEVERAL CASE STUDIES FOCUSING ECOTOURISM IN MPAS, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INDUSTRY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY, AND THE EFFORTS FOR OCEAN CONSERVATION. FROM THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED, WE CONCLUDE THAT ECOTOURISM DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN MPAS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL ROOM TO NEW ADVANCES IMPROVING GOOD MARINE GOVERNANCE.

SCI.,"ISLAND GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE DECENT WORK AND SOCIAL PROTECTION THEIR HIGHEST POLICY PRIORITY, AIMING TO LINK THEM TO THE SO-CALLED BLUE ECONOMY SECTORS SUCH AS FISHERIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL-SCALE COMMERCIAL FISHING IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TRANSNATIONAL FISHERIES TRADE AND DEPENDS ON DIVE FISHER LABOUR FORCE FACING ISSUES WITH DEFICITS IN DECENT WORK, HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND SAFETY AT SEA PROVISIONS. GIVEN THE MACRO-POLICY PRIORITIES FOR DECENT WORK IN THE TRANSITION OF SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES (SIDS) TO BLUE ECONOMY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS IN SMALL-SCALE COMMERCIAL FISHERIES TRADE THAT HAVE EXACERBATED UNSAFE MARINE WORKING CONDITIONS OF DIVE FISHERS. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL FISHERIES TRADE, THE MISMATCH BETWEEN MACRO-LEVEL DECISIONS AND MICRO-LEVEL LABOUR NEEDS HAS HARDLY BEEN EXPLORED VIA THE BLUE ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL INTERLINKAGES. THIS STUDY USED A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS OF DIVE FISHERS AND EXAMINED WHY DIVE-RELATED ACCIDENTS AND FATALITIES OCCUR IN COMMERCIAL FISHERIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IN THE ANALYSIS OF DIVING ACCIDENTS HELPS THE STUDY TO, FIRSTLY, HIGHLIGHT THE GAPS BETWEEN MACRO POLICY AND PRACTICE AT THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS. SECONDLY, THE APPROACH HELPS EXPLORE THE NEED FOR A COHERENT APPROACH TO POLICY INTEGRATION THAT BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN THE MACRO AND OPERATIONAL LEVELS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES LABOUR FORCE. THE STUDY ANALYSES THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION’S DECENT WORK INSTRUMENTS WITH SIDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES FOR FISHERIES WORKFORCE AND POINTS OUT THAT GOVERNMENTS MUST BE RESPONSIBLE AT THE MACRO LEVEL FOR MANAGING ACCIDENTS AT SEA AND BUILDING A SAFE DIVING WORKFORCE THROUGH COMPETENT MARINE AND DIVING AUTHORITIES.

URBANISED AREAS HAVE BEEN ALTERNATELY CHARACTERISED IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AS DEGRADED, DEPAUPERATE, OR IN SOME CASES DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT. TO ADVANCE OUR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNITY OF MOBILE MARINE FAUNA IN THESE AREAS, WE USED REPEATED SONAR IMAGE SAMPLING OVER LARGE SWATHES OF TWO URBAN-INDUSTRIAL SEASCAPES, COMBINED WITH UNDERWATER VIDEO. 2,341 SONAR SEGMENTS WERE CAPTURED ACROSS MACKAY HARBOUR AND THE PIONEER RIVER ESTUARY (NORTH QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA). WE USED THIS INFORMATION TO GENERATE A PRELIMINARY UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECOLOGY OF THESE LOCATIONS. WE FOUND THAT OVERALL, URBAN-INDUSTRIAL SEASCAPES CAN CONTAIN COUNTS OF MOBILE MARINE FAUNA SIMILAR TO NATURAL AREAS, AND THAT THESE SEASCAPES ARE CHARACTERISED BY DYNAMIC DIEL SHIFTS IN THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF MOBILE MARINE FAUNA IN THE WATER COLUMN. AT NIGHT, LARGE FISH ARE PREVALENT IN THE WATER COLUMN, WHILE DURING THE DAY, ASSEMBLAGES ARE DOMINATED BY SMALL FISH. WITHIN THESE URBAN-INDUSTRIAL SEASCAPES, DEEPER AREAS CONTAINING HEAVY INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS PORTS CAN HARBOUR LARGE DENSITIES OF FISH, INCLUDING HEAVILY TARGETED FISHERIES SPECIES.

CHINA, JAPAN, AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA (ROK)ARE NOW AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE TO THEIR SURROUNDING WATERS AND THEIR COUNTRY’S DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER,THE POOR IMPLEMENTATION OF MARINE GOVERNANCE GIVES RISE TO THE UNSATISFACTORY EFFECT OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE GOVERNANCE IN THE SEA AREA. BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF BLUE ECONOMY AND THE DATA OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN THE YELLOW SEA AND EAST CHINA SEA, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING BINDING LEGAL NORMS AND POLICIES TO PROMOTE THE PROGRESS OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE TREATMENT IN CHINA, JAPAN AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA. BY USING RESEARCH METHODS OF TEXT ANALYSIS AND STATUS SURVEY, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE DIFFERENCES AND COMMON DEMANDS OF CHINA, JAPAN AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION CONTROL. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THREE COUNTRIES HAVE COMMON DEMANDS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE OF MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FLEXIBLE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS. FINALLY, THROUGH THE CASE EXPERIENCE OF THE BLUE CYCLE MODEL OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE IN TAIZHOU, ZHEJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THAT THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BE USED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE IN CHINA, JAPAN AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA. THREE COUNTRIES CAN GRADUALLY PROMOTE THE COOPERATION OF MARINE PLASTIC WASTE LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY STARTING WITH THE TREATMENT OF\ FISHERY PLASTIC WASTE, AND INNOVATE THE BLUE CYCLE MODEL, SO AS TO FINALLY PROMOTE THE CONCLUSION OF THE REGIONAL MARINE WASTE TREATMENT AGREEMENT.

A PROGRESSIVE NATIONAL STANCE TOWARDS OCEAN SUSTAINABILITY AND AN EMERGING ECONOMY PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY TOURISTS ARE TWO OF SEVERAL FACTORS THAT MAKE SEYCHELLES A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD LABELLING AND CONSUMPTION PROGRAMME, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES FOR FISHERY HARVESTERS, REGULATORS, BUYERS AND CONSUMERS TO IMPROVE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES.

MAR. SCI.,"RECENTLY, THE RIGHTS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERS HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN OCEAN GOVERNANCE BECAUSE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT AND VARIOUS MARITIME ACTIVITIES HAVE REDUCED TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUNDS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES (SSF) ARE INCREASINGLY BEING THREATENED BY OCEAN GRABBING, POLLUTION, AND A LACK OF INCLUSIVENESS IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE GUIDELINES TO RESOLVE AND REDUCE CONFLICT, FORMAL AVENUES TO INCLUDE FISHER CONCERNS, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF OCEAN DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE, REMAIN A DIFFICULT TASK. MOREOVER, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON HOW FISHERS ARE IMPACTED BY COASTAL AND MARINE DEVELOPMENT AND HOW THEIR CONCERNS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. HENCE, THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SSF DISCOURSE BY UNDERSTANDING AND DESCRIBING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND CONCERNS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERS FROM TWO COASTAL TOWNS IN EAST AFRICA WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PORT DEVELOPMENT. USING DATA FROM PERCEPTION SURVEYS, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, AND PARTICIPATORY MAPPING, WE DISCUSS HOW FISHERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES TO DEVELOP PORTS IN LAMU, KENYA, AND BAGAMOYO, TANZANIA. WE FOUND THAT FISHERS RELY ON NEARSHORE ECOSYSTEMS SUCH AS MANGROVES AND CORAL REEFS BECAUSE OF THEIR ACCESSIBILITY SINCE MOST FISHERS ONLY USE LOW-POWERED BOATS FOR FISHING. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT THE FISHERS’ LIVELIHOODS WERE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY PORT DEVELOPMENT AND THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS CONCERNING THE PORT’S CONSTRUCTION AND FISHERS’ COMPENSATIONS. WHILE SOME FISHERS BELIEVE THAT NEW PORTS IN THE REGION CAN INCREASE THEIR LIVELIHOODS BY CREATING NEW MARKETS AND JOBS, THIS IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN SINCE MOST FISHERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO WORK IN FORMAL PORT-RELATED JOBS. WE PROPOSE THREE STEPS THAT WILL ALLOW FISHERMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN PORT DEVELOPMENT DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUSTAINABLE SSF. THESE INCLUDE IMPROVING ENGAGEMENT WITH FISHERS TO ALLOW MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING, DEVELOPING A BLUE ECONOMY POLICY FOCUSED ON SSF, AND IMPLEMENTING MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING.

MAR. SCI.,"RECREATIONAL CHARTER BOAT FISHERIES PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL FISHERIES, ESPECIALLY TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN WARM SEAS. CHARTER BOAT FISHING HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED IN TEMPERATE REGIONS, AND THE FACTORS THAT TRIGGER ITS DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO FISHING COMMUNITIES ARE UNKNOWN. WE PERFORMED AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF RECREATIONAL CHARTER BOAT FISHERIES IN THE EASTERN NORTH ATLANTIC TO ASSESS THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIAL WELFARE. WE SELECTED TWO CASE STUDIES LOCATED IN GALICIA (NW SPAIN) AND MADEIRA ARCHIPELAGO (PORTUGAL). THE TWO CASES DIFFER IN THE SOCIOECOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES IN WHICH RECREATIONAL CHARTER BOAT FISHING IS DEVELOPED (E.G., RELEVANCE OF COMMERCIAL FISHING, TOURISM, OR TARGETED SPECIES), THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT. UP TO 7 CHARTER FISHING COMPANIES WERE IDENTIFIED IN GALICIA (10 BOATS) AND 14 IN MADEIRA (18 BOATS), AND INFORMATION ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE ACTIVITY WERE COLLECTED BY A QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERED BY COMPANY MANAGERS AND SKIPPERS. CHARTER BOATS IN GALICIA ARE OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND ANGLERS MOSTLY ENGAGE IN BOTTOM FISHING TARGETING DEMERSAL PREDATORS LIKE BALLAN WRASSE (LABRUS BERGYLTA) AND EUROPEAN SEABASS (DICENTRARCHUS LABRAX) THAT THEY RETAIN. DESPITE THE STRONG SEASONALITY OF THE FISHERY IN MADEIRA, FOCUSED ON SUMMERS, THE FISHING EFFORT IS HIGHER THAN IN GALICIA. ON AVERAGE, CHARTER BOATS GO FISHING FOR 39.3 ± 41.5 (SD) FISHING JOURNEYS AND TAKE 2 500 ANGLERS ON BOARD PER YEAR IN GALICIA, WHILE IN MADEIRA THEY FISH 63.7 ± 32.7 JOURNEYS AND TAKE 3 200 ANGLERS ON BOARD. ANGLERS TARGET IN MADEIRA PELAGIC TOP PREDATORS LIKE BLUE MARLIN (MAKAIRA NIGRICANS), OR SOME TUNA SPECIES, E.G., BIGEYE (THUNNUS OBESUS), BY TROLLING IN A CATCH AND RELEASE FISHERY. THE ECONOMIC BALANCE OF COMPANIES WAS MORE FAVORABLE IN MADEIRA, WITH AN AVERAGE GROSS ANNUAL PROFIT OF € 28 883 ± 30 755, WHILE ECONOMIC YIELD IN GALICIA WAS € 4 444 ± 7 916. WE ALSO APPLIED A TRAVEL COST METHOD TO ASSESS THE RECREATION DEMAND OF RECREATIONAL FISHING TRIPS BASED ON A QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERED BY 150 CLIENTS IN GALICIA AND 55 IN MADEIRA. WE ESTIMATED THE VISITOR SURPLUS MEAN VALUE TO BE € 1 385 PER YEAR IN GALICIA (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, CI95%= € 1 219 – € 1 550), AND € 1 738 IN MADEIRA (CI95%= € 1 433 – 2 043). THE SOCIAL ANNUAL RECREATION VALUE OF GALICIAN FISHERY WAS WORTH € 3.4 MILLION, RANGING BETWEEN € 3.0 M AND € 3.8 M, A VALUE WELL BELOW THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC IMPACT GENERATED BY COMMERCIAL FISHING (€ 700 M). THE RECREATION VALUE OF THE CHARTER BOAT FISHERY IN MADEIRA, € 6.3 M, RANGING BETWEEN € 5.2 M AND € 7.5 M, IS COMPARABLE TO THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL FISHING, THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY WITH € 12 M.

MAR. SCI.,"TO EFFECTIVELY FUTURE-PROOF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FISHING FLEETS WE HAVE EXPLORED A SUITE OF CASE STUDIES ENCOMPASSING THE NORTHEAST AND TROPICAL ATLANTIC, THE MEDITERRANEAN, BALTIC AND BLACK SEAS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT EUROPEAN UNION (EU) FISHERIES ARE LIKELY RESILIENT TO CLIMATE-DRIVEN SHORT-TERM STRESSES, BUT MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, FISHERIES’ LONG-TERM STOCK RESILIENCE CAN BE IMPROVED (AND THEREFORE BE MORE RESILIENT TO INCREASING CHANGES IN CLIMATE) BY ADOPTING ROBUST AND ADAPTIVE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, PROVIDED SUCH MEASURES ARE BASED ON SOUND SCIENTIFIC ADVICE WHICH INCLUDES UNCERTAINTY. SUCH MANAGEMENT REQUIRES REGULAR UPDATES OF BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE POINTS. SUCH UPDATES WILL DELINEATE SAFE BIOLOGICAL LIMITS FOR EXPLOITATION, PROVIDING BOTH HIGH LONG-TERM YIELDS WITH REDUCED RISK OF STOCK COLLAPSE WHEN AFFECTED BY SHORT-TERM STRESSES, AND ENHANCED COMPLIANCE WITH ADVICE TO AVOID HIGHER THAN INTENDED FISHING MORTALITY. HOWEVER, HIGH RESILIENCE OF THE EXPLOITED ECOSYSTEM DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE RESILIENCE OF THE ECONOMY OF EU FISHERIES FROM SUFFERING SHOCKS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED YIELDS, NEITHER TO A REDUCED CARBON FOOTPRINT IF FUEL USE INCREASES FROM LOWER STOCK ABUNDANCES. FUEL CONSUMPTION IS IMPACTED BY STOCK DEVELOPMENT, BUT ALSO BY CHANGES IN VESSEL AND GEAR TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS FISHING TECHNIQUES. IN THIS RESPECT, ENERGY-EFFICIENT FISHING TECHNOLOGIES ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE EU, THOUGH IMPLEMENTING THEM WOULD REQUIRE IMPROVING THE UPTAKE OF INNOVATIONS AND DEMONSTRATING TO STAKEHOLDERS THE POTENTIAL FOR BOTH REDUCED FUEL COSTS AND INCREASED CATCH RATES. A TRANSITION TOWARDS REDUCING FUEL CONSUMPTION AND COSTS WOULD NEED TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE SETUP OF EU REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS. OVERALL, TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE EU FISHERIES WITHIN A CHANGING CLIMATE, FLEXIBLE, ADAPTIVE, WELL-INFORMED AND WELL-ENFORCED MANAGEMENT IS NEEDED, WITH INCENTIVES PROVIDED FOR INNOVATIONS AND OCEAN LITERACY TO COPE WITH THE CHANGING CONDITIONS, WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE DEPENDENCY OF THE CAPTURE FISHING INDUSTRY ON FOSSIL FUELS. TO SUPPORT SUCH MANAGEMENT, WE PROVIDE 10 LESSONS TO CHARACTERIZE ‘WIN-WIN’ FISHING STRATEGIES FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH DEVELOP LEVERAGES IN WHICH FISHING EFFORT DEPLOYED CORRESPONDS TO MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE YIELD TARGETS AND COMMON FISHERIES POLICY MINIMAL EFFECTS OBJECTIVES. IN THESE STRATEGIES, HIGHER CATCH IS OBTAINED IN THE LONG RUN, LESS FUEL IS SPENT TO ATTAIN THE CATCH, AND THE FISHERIES HAVE A HIGHER RESISTANCE AND RESILIENCE TO SHOCK AND LONG-TERM FACTORS TO FACE CLIMATE-INDUCED STRESSES.

MAR. SCI.,"THE ROLE THAT SEAWEEDS PLAY AS PRIMARY PRODUCERS AND ECOSYSTEMS ENGINEERS IN MARINE COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED. SEAWEEDS, HOWEVER, ARE ALSO IMPORTANT DRIVERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BLUE BIOECONOMY DUE TO THEIR VAST DIVERSITY OF UNIQUE CHEMICALS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. IN TROPICAL REGIONS, SEAWEED PRODUCTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON A FEW SPECIES ONLY, BECAUSE OF THEIR HYDROCOLLOIDS USED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY. THERE IS A STRONG NEED TO IDENTIFY NEW APPLICATIONS OF RED SEAWEED SPECIES IN OTHER SECTORS SUCH AS AQUACULTURE. THEREFORE, TO DIVERSIFY THE CULTURE OF RED SEAWEEDS, MORE TROPICAL SPECIES NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND POTENTIAL APPLICATION IN AQUACULTURE, AND THEN, TO DEVELOP A METHOD FOR A SUSTAINABLE CULTIVATION OF NEW SEAWEED CANDIDATES AND ENHANCE THEIR ECONOMIC POTENTIAL. BASED ON THIS CONTEXT, WE ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF THE RED EDIBLE SEAWEED ACANTHOPHORA SPP., AN UNDER-VALUED SEAWEED SPECIES WHICH IS NATURALLY ABUNDANT IN TROPICAL COUNTRIES, AND KAPPAPHYCUS SPP., A COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE SEAWEED COMMONLY USED FOR POLYSACCHARIDE EXTRACTION. THE VAST CHEMICAL DIVERSITY OF SEAWEEDS (POLYSACCHARIDES, PHYTOHORMONES, AMINO ACIDS, AND PIGMENTS) HAS LED TO RESEARCH ON A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS IN AQUACULTURE, INCLUDING PATHOGEN CONTROL, IMMUNOSTIMULANT, ANTIOXIDANT, BIOREMEDIATION, FEED, UV PROTECTANTS, INCREASE IN SEAFOOD SHELF LIFE, ANIMAL COLORANT, AND GROWTH REGULATOR FOR MICROALGA CULTURE. THIS REVIEW HOPES TO STIMULATE THE INTEREST AMONG SEAWEED RESEARCHERS TO INVESTIGATE OTHER LOCAL SEAWEED SPECIES AND SEEK GREATER ADDED VALUE OF THEIR BIOMASS AND CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN THE AQUACULTURE SECTOR. ADDITIONALLY, THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP STAKEHOLDERS TO BENEFIT FROM THESE TWO RED SEAWEEDS BY CONTRIBUTING TO THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE BLUE BIOECONOMY IN TROPICAL COUNTRIES.

NETWORKS OF SENSORS WITH FREQUENT SAMPLING CAPABILITIES ARE NEEDED TO RUN FORECAST MODELS, IMPROVE NAVIGATION, AND INFORM CLIMATE RESEARCH. SAMPLING FREQUENCY AND DEPLOYMENT DURATION ARE CURRENTLY CONSTRAINED BY BATTERY POWER LIMITATIONS. IN-SITU POWER GENERATION USING MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS WAVES AND CURRENTS CAN BE USED TO CIRCUMVENT THIS CONSTRAINT.

MAR. SCI.,"INTRODUCTION: BLUE ECONOMICS RESEARCH IS A RESEARCH FIELD THAT IS ACHIEVING MORE AND MORE INTEREST AMONG INTERNATIONAL SCIENTISTS. THIS STUDY ADDS MORE KNOWLEDGE AS IT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BLUE ECONOMIC FACTORS – LIVING AND NON-LIVING RESOURCES, OCEAN ENERGY, PORT ACTIVITIES, SHIPBUILDING AND REPAIR, MARITIME TRANSPORT, COASTAL TOURISM, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR, PER CAPITA INCOME, FISH CAPTURE, INTERNAL RENEWABLE WATER RESOURCES PER CAPITA, MARINE PROTECTED AREAS, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND POPULATION DENSITY, ALL FACTORS RELATED TO MARITIME ACTIVITIES – AND THE BLUE ECONOMY (BE) ITSELF. METHODS: IN ORDER TO REACH THESE OBJECTIVES, SOME SPECIAL ANALYTICAL AND ECONOMETRIC METHODS ARE USED. AMONG THEM THE MULTIVARIATE GRANGER CAUSALITY THEORY, THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS AND PANEL DATA TECHNIQUES ARE EMPLOYED. THIS SET OF METHODS HELPS US TO STUDY THE COMPLEX SET OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIOUS FACTORS RELATED TO THE BE AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON PER CAPITA INCOME (PCI) AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE DATA USED TO CONDUCT THIS RESEARCH WERE COLLECTED FROM THE EUROSTAT, THE E.U. STATISTICAL DATABASE. SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND THE SPAN PERIOD 2010-2018 ARE USED TOO. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS SHOWED EVIDENCE THAT PER CAPITA INCOME IS ASSOCIATED TO OTHER FACTORS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY, THAT PCI (GRANGER) CAUSES COASTAL TOURISM AND POPULATION DENSITY, AND THAT THERE ARE FIVE OTHER FACTORS THAT POSITIVELY INFLUENCE PCI GROWTH, NAMELY, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (GHG), MARITIME TRANSPORT, NONLIVING RESOURCES AND PORTS’ ACTIVITIES. THIS PAPER ADDS SOME NEW UNDERSTANDINGS TO THEORY AND CALLS THE ATTENTION TO SOCIETY, IN GENERAL, AND THE BLUE ECONOMICS, IN PARTICULAR. FOR INSTANCE, IF POLICYMAKERS WANT TO INCREASE INCOME PER CAPITA OF THESE REGIONS, THEY SHOULD TAKE ACTION ON SOME VARIABLES SUCH AS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR (HDI), GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS, LIVING RESOURCES, MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OCEAN ENERGY. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT BLUE ECONOMY IS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO PROMOTE BOTH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PCI. DISCUSSION: THE CONCERNS THAT MAKE UP THE BLUE ECONOMY, SUCH AS OCEAN ENERGY, PORT ACTIVITIES, SHIP BUILDING AND REPAIR, MARITIME TRANSPORT, COASTAL TOURISM, HDI, MARITIME FISH CAPTURE, MARINE PROTECTED AREAS, AND GHG REDUCTIONARE GOOD FACTORS TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. AMONG THESE, THE MOST INFLUENCING ARE MARITIME TRANSPORT, LIVING RESOURCES AND THE PRODUCTION OF OCEAN ENERGY. THIS STUDY ADDS KNOWLEDGE TO THEORY, INNOVATES IN THE METHODS AND TECHNIQUES USED, IN THE RESULTS DISCOVERED, IN ITS DISCUSSION, AND IN THE MIXTURE OF BLUE ECONOMIC FACTORS, TOO. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST PAPERS THAT FILLS THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT BLUE ECONOMY.

MAR. SCI.,"FISHERS’ LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE (LEK) CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT OR SUPPLEMENT LONG-TERM TRENDS IN HEAVILY EXPLOITED POPULATION OR POORLY ASSESSED SPECIES WITH LOW BIOMASS. WE USED HISTORICAL MEMORIES OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF CHANGES IN CATCH TRENDS IN MARINE FISHERIES OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. THE STUDY AIMED AT EVALUATING HOW FISHERS COULD PROVIDE CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE DATA ON MAJOR FISH SPECIES/GROUPS COMPARABLE WITH OFFICIAL CATCH DATA AND TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF INCREASING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN FISHERY MANAGEMENT. WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS (FGDS) AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERIENCED FISHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, USING A STRUCTURED TEMPLATE RELATED TO THE CATCH AND EFFORT DATA. USING FGD DATA, WE SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARED CHANGES IN FISH CATCH RATES AND EFFORT OVER TIME AND SPACE. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON MAJOR GROUPS OF SPECIES THAT HAD REASONABLE LANDING OVER TIME. OVERALL, THE ANALYSIS REVEALED CHANGES IN CATCH RATE, MONTHLY LANDINGS PER LANDING CENTER, FACTORS THAT LIKELY INFLUENCE THE CATCH TRENDS, AND THE SPATIAL EXPANSION OF FISHERIES. OUR STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO SPECIES’ ABUNDANCE OVER TIME. FISHERS’ LEK SHOWS DECLINING CATCH RATES FOR MAJOR SPECIES AND GROUPS, BUT MONTHLY HARVESTS AT LANDING CENTERS HAVE INCREASED OVER TWO DECADES BECAUSE OF INCREASED FISHING EFFORTS. SMALL-SCALE FISHERS ARE CATCHING MORE FISH FROM DEEPER WATERS OVER TIME, INDICATING A GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT OF FISHERIES BEYOND TRADITIONALLY EXPLOITED AREAS. SUCH EXPANSIONS OF NEARSHORE FISHERIES MAY RESULT FROM THE OVERFISHING OF NEARBY AREAS. ON THE CONTRARY, THIS COULD BE VIEWED AS A POSITIVE INDICATION OF THE POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES IN THE REGION, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BLUE ECONOMY. THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN OFFICIAL STATISTICS AND FISHERS’ DATA ON SPECIES CATCH TRENDS OVER TIME SUGGESTS THAT FISHERS HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR FISHING SYSTEM. THIS INDICATES THAT FISHERS’ KNOWLEDGE COULD BE INVALUABLE, ESPECIALLY IN DATA-POOR AREAS. LEK INTEGRATION INTO POLICY AND MANAGEMENT IS THUS EXPECTED TO FACILITATE THE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES.

POLITICAL. SCI.,"NEW APPROACHES TO OCEAN GOVERNANCE FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES ARE NEEDED. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE STATUS QUO DOES NOT MEET THE DIVERSE DEVELOPMENT ASPIRATIONS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES OR ENSURE HEALTHY OCEANS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE BLUE ECONOMY IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO USD2.5–3 TRILLION BY 2030, AND THERE IS PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ITS POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY IN LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES, AND TO SUPPORT A BLUE RECOVERY FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SELECTIVE, THEMATIC REVIEW OF THE BLUE ECONOMY LITERATURE TO EXAMINE: (I) THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES, (II) THE BARRIERS AND ENABLERS THAT SHAPE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, AND (III) THE STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY COMMUNITIES AND SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH CAN BE STRENGTHENED TO DELIVER A ‘SUSTAINABLE' BLUE ECONOMY AND IMPROVE SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. OUR REVIEW FINDS THAT UNDER BUSINESS-AS-USUAL AND BLUE GROWTH, INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES, LARGE-SCALE AQUACULTURE, LAND RECLAMATION, MINING, AND OIL AND GAS RAISE RED FLAGS FOR COMMUNITIES AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. WHEREAS, IF MANAGED SUSTAINABLY, SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES, COASTAL AQUACULTURE, SEAWEED FARMING AND ECO-TOURISM ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO DELIVER BENEFITS TO COMMUNITIES. YET, THESE ARE ALSO THE SECTORS MOST VULNERABLE TO NEGATIVE AND CUMULATIVE IMPACTS FROM OTHER SECTORS. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF ENABLERS, BARRIERS AND STRATEGIES, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT PUTTING COASTAL COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTER OF A CLEAR VISION FOR AN INCLUSIVE SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY AND CO-DEVELOPING A SHARED AND ACCESSIBLE LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITIES, PRACTITIONERS AND POLICY-MAKERS IS ESSENTIAL FOR A MORE EQUITABLE OCEAN ECONOMY, ALONGSIDE MAINSTREAMING SOCIAL JUSTICE PRINCIPLES AND INTEGRATED GOVERNANCE THAT CAN BRIDGE DIFFERENT SCALES OF ACTION AND OPPORTUNITY.

POLITICAL. SCI.,"THE BLUE ECONOMY HAS EMERGED AS AN INFLUENTIAL GLOBAL CONCEPT. IT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD TO RELATE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OCEAN IN A MANNER WHICH ALSO ADDRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT OCEAN HEALTH IN THE FACE OF INCREASING DEMANDS ON OCEAN RESOURCES, MARINE POLLUTION, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. WHILE THE BLUE ECONOMY HOLDS POTENTIAL TO ACT AS AN INTEGRATING POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OCEAN, TO DATE, THERE ARE LIMITED EXAMPLES OF IMPLEMENTATION IN PRACTICE TO TEST THE USEFULNESS OF THE CONCEPT. BASED ON A TYPOLOGY OF “GOOD GOVERNANCE” ADAPTED FROM EXISTING GLOBAL TYPOLOGIES, WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF BLUE ECONOMY GOVERNANCE IN ENABLING INTEGRATION. WE USED A MIXED METHODS APPROACH TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCE OF SEYCHELLES, A BLUE ECONOMY EARLY ADOPTER, COMBINING POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS, SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH KEY ACTORS AND PARTNERS, AND COUNTRY FIELDWORK. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT FROM ITS INCEPTION, SEYCHELLES' VISION OF BLUE ECONOMY WAS A TRANSFORMATIVE MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE PROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF OCEAN RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFIT OF SEYCHELLOIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE SDGS. THANKS TO EARLY POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AND INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT, THE ADOPTION OF THE BLUE ECONOMY CONCEPT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING AWARENESS OF THE OCEAN HEALTH AND ITS CONNECTION TO PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY, AND IN ESTABLISHING THE BASIS OF A NATIONAL BLUE ECONOMY “ARCHITECTURE,” WHICH HELPED SECURE INNOVATIVE FINANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. TRANSITIONING TO IMPLEMENTATION, SEVERAL GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES EMERGED, WHICH INCLUDED MAINTAINING HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL MOMENTUM, STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, AND INSTITUTIONAL COORDINATION AND CAPACITY. WHILE SOME GOVERNANCE BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION MAY BE UNIQUE TO SEYCHELLES, SOME ARE COMMON TO SIDS, AND OTHERS ARE FOUND IN A RANGE OF GOVERNANCE SETTINGS. SEYCHELLES INTERNATIONAL VISIBILITY HAS BROUGHT HIGH EXPECTATIONS, NOT ALWAYS COMMENSURATE WITH LOCAL ASPIRATIONS, CAPABILITIES, AND JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS, DIVERSITY, SOCIAL EQUITY, AND INCLUSION CONSIDERATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN FOREGROUNDED IN THE DISCOURSE SURROUNDING THE BE AND ARE CONTINUOUSLY OVERLOOKED AND UNDERVALUED. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE ONGOING SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN THE BE AND DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS AND COSTS ACROSS DIFFERENT GROUPS IN SOCIETY. IT ALSO EXPLORES WHY EQUITY MATTERS, AND HOW IT CAN BE ACHIEVED. MIRRORING THE CALL FOR UNDER-REPRESENTED OR MARGINALIZED SOCIAL GROUPS TO RECEIVE A FAIR SHARE OF THE RETURNS, WHICH MAY BE MORE THAN THEY HAVE RECEIVED TO DATE. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT BETWEEN 1988 AND 2017, A GERMANY–BASED COMPANY HAS REGISTERED ABOUT 39% OF ALL KNOWN MARINE GENETIC RESOURCES, WHILE THREE COMPANIES IN ASIA CONTROL 30% OF THE MARKET SHARE OF SEAFOOD SECTOR IN 2018. THESE FINDINGS SHOW HIGH CONSOLIDATION OF THE OCEAN SPACE BY TOP CORPORATIONS. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE EXCLUSION OF EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS WITHIN THE BE INVESTMENTS CAN UNDERMINE OCEAN-BASED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MARINE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION INITIATIVES THAT MAY DISRUPT THE OCEAN SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA.

SUSTAIN.,"KUWAIT'S “BLUE ECONOMY” PROJECT AIMS TO HELP REPLACE THE COUNTRY'S OIL AND GAS INCOME BY THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS MARINE RESOURCES. THE FISHING INDUSTRY HAS A PRIME PLACE IN THE “BLUE ECONOMY” PROJECT, BUT NINE OF THE MAIN FISH SPECIES IN KUWAIT HAVE RECENTLY DECLINED RUBIAN (SHRIMP), ZOBAIDI (SILVER POMFRET), SUBOOR (HILSA SHAD), NAQROOR (JAVELIN GRUNTER), HAMOOR (ORANGE-SPOTTED GROUPER), HAMRA (MALABAR BLOOD SNAPPER), HALWAYUH (BLACK POMFRET), FRUSH (TROUT SWEETLIPS), AND KASUR (LIZARD FISH). THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE NATURE OF POLLUTION IN KUWAITI WATERS, EXAMINING ITS EXTENT AND CAUSES, QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A PRIMARY REASON FOR FISH DECLINE, AND DISCUSSING WHAT MEASURES COULD BE TAKEN TO REDUCE OR REMOVE IT. THE DATA FOR THIS STUDY WERE GATHERED FROM PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES, OFFICIAL KUWAITI STATISTICS AND REPORTS, AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED IN KUWAIT WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE FISHERIES INCLUDING STAFF IN THE KUWAITI SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE, THE FISHERY PROTECTION AUTHORITY, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AUTHORITY AND GOVERNMENTAL DEPARTMENTS; FISHERS; AND FISHERY BUSINESS OWNERS. THE MAIN FINDING OF THIS STUDY IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE WEAK GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO COUNTER POLLUTION, POLLUTION DOES EXIST IN KUWAITI WATERS, BUT THERE IS NO SOLID EVIDENCE THAT IT HAS A DIRECT LINK TO THE DECLINE IN FISH STOCKS. OVERFISHING, ESPECIALLY BY ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED (IUU) VESSELS, SEEMS TO BE A MORE SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE OF THE DECLINE IN FISH STOCKS. COPYRIGHT © 2021 ALQATTAN AND GRAY.",NA,"M.E.A.

SUSTAIN. FOOD SYST.,"THIS STUDY UNDERTAKES A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF SELECTED MARICULTURE ENTERPRISES IN THE COASTAL REGIONS OF INDIA, CENTERED ON LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY AS THE KEY FOCUS. THIS IS JUXTAPOSED AGAINST INDIA'S AMBITIOUS BLUE ECONOMY TARGETS AND POLICY THRUST THAT PIN ON THE EXPANSION OF MARICULTURE AS A PROMISING AVENUE FOR ENHANCING MARINE FISH PRODUCTION. FARM-LEVEL, REGION-SPECIFIC, TECHNO-ECONOMIC, AND SOCIO-CULTURAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH, AND CONDITIONAL ON, SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION OF MARICULTURE-BASED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL. THE PRINCIPLES-CRITERIA-INDICATORS (PCI) APPROACH IS USED TO ESTABLISH THE LINKAGE BETWEEN IDENTIFIED FARM-LEVEL INDICATORS AND VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY. WHILE THE SELECTED ENTERPRISES WERE ASSESSED TO BE TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE IN GENERAL, GLARING GAPS WERE EVIDENT ON KEY INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABILITY SUCH AS THE LEGITIMACY OF ACCESS OVER WATER BODIES, USE OF QUALITY SEED AND FEED, INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT ACCESS, MARKET ACCESS, AND FAIR MARKETING PRACTICES, OPTIMAL STOCKING DENSITY, MECHANIZATION, USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL-FRIENDLY CULTURE PRACTICES, FARM SURVEILLANCE, CREW SAFETY, AND SOCIAL PROTECTION. THIS INDICATES THE NEED FOR TAKING PROACTIVE MEASURES TO ENSURE THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF MARICULTURE, PARTICULARLY IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF ESTABLISHMENT WHEN SUCH INTERVENTIONS ARE EASY TO ADOPT. BASED ON THE INSIGHTS OBTAINED FROM THE ANALYSIS, A BROAD SET OF STRATEGIES, POLICY OPTIONS, AND INSTITUTIONAL INTERVENTIONS CRITICAL TO SCALING-UP COASTAL MARICULTURE ENTERPRISES ALONG THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF INDIA ARE PRESENTED.

IN GENERAL, ISLANDS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ENERGY IMPORTS WHICH, IN TURN, FEATURE A MARKED SEASONAL DEMAND. EFFORTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THESE REGIONS CAN THEREFORE FULFILL A TWOFOLD OBJECTIVE: (I) TO INCREASE THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SHARE FOR GLOBAL DECARBONIZATION AND (II) TO REDUCE THE EXTERNAL ENERGY DEPENDENCE FOR ISOLATED (OR INTERCONNECTED) SYSTEMS IN WHICH THIS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH AN INCREASE OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SHARE. HOWEVER, THE INCREASE IN RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES MAKES ENERGY GENERATION MORE DEPENDENT ON FUTURE CLIMATE AND ITS VARIABILITY. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYZE FUTURE PROJECTIONS OF WIND AND PHOTOVOLTAIC POTENTIAL, AS WELL AS ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY DROUGHTS, ON THE MAIN EURO-MEDITERRANEAN ISLANDS. DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS IN LAND SURFACE AVAILABLE IN THE ISLANDS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPACITY, THE ANALYSIS IS EXTENDED TO OFFSHORE WIND AND PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY, WHICH MAY HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FUTURE INCREASES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SHARE. TO THAT END, WE USE CLIMATE VARIABLES FROM A SERIES OF SIMULATIONS DERIVED FROM EURO-CORDEX (COORDINATED DOWNSCALING EXPERIMENT) SIMULATIONS FOR THE RCP2.6 AND RCP8.5 EMISSION SCENARIOS. A SPECIAL EFFORT IS PERFORMED TO NORMALIZE PROJECTED CHANGES AND THE ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTIES.

AMONG THE MOST WIDELY CULTIVATED GENERA OF SEAWEEDS IN OPEN-SEA PILOT SYSTEMS IN COLOMBIA ARE HYDROPUNTIA, GRACILARIA, HYPNEA, KAPPAPHYCUS, AND EUCHEUMA. THESE GENERA HAVE SHOWN LOW YIELDS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIGH TISSUE FRAGILITY, EPIPHYTISM, SEDIMENTATION, AND NITROGEN DEFICIENCY. IN ADDITION, THE EVALUATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF SELECTED SEAWEED COMPOUNDS HAS ADVANCED CONSIDERABLY, FOCUSING ON THEIR COMPOSITION AND THEIR USE FOR DIRECT CONSUMPTION BY HUMANS AND ANIMALS. DESPITE THE DIVERSITY OF SEAWEEDS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES, COLOMBIA IS STILL LAGGING BEHIND OTHER COUNTRIES IN SEAWEED EXPLOITATION, BOTH IN LATIN AMERICA AND WORLDWIDE.

SINCE THE ISSUANCE OF THE FIRST BLUE BOND IN THE SEYCHELLES IN 2018, MULTIPLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TURNED TO THE BLUE BOND MARKET TO RAISE FUNDS. HOWEVER, UNLIKE THE GREEN BOND MARKET, NO COMPREHENSIVE MARKET OVERVIEW EXISTS, PREVENTING STAKEHOLDERS FROM JUDGING WHETHER THIS LABEL HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING WATER RESOURCES AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ON ITS FUTURE POTENTIAL. THIS PAPER DRAWS ON AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND COMPLEMENTS IT WITH A UNIQUE AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF BLUE BONDS ISSUED TO DATE, PROVIDING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE ON SUSTAINABLE FINANCE. BETWEEN 2018 AND 2022, 26 BLUE BOND TRANSACTIONS TOOK PLACE, AMOUNTING TO A TOTAL VALUE OF USD 5.0 BILLION, WITH A 92% CAGR BETWEEN THOSE YEARS. CURRENTLY, BLUE BONDS REPRESENT LESS THAN 0.5% OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEBT MARKET. THE USE OF PROCEEDS HAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON WASTE MANAGEMENT, BIODIVERSITY, AND SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES, BUT ALSO RANGES ACROSS OTHER AREAS OF THE SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY. ONLY TWO-THIRDS OF BLUE BOND ISSUERS REPORT ON IMPACT METRICS, PROVIDING FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ADD DETAIL AND RIGOR. WE DRAW COMPARISONS TO THE MORE MATURE GREEN BOND MARKET AND CONCLUDE THAT A LACK OF STANDARDIZED DEFINITIONS, METRICS, AND EXPERTISE BY ISSUERS AND INVESTORS ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO THE BLUE BOND MARKET. RESOLVING THESE BARRIERS IS CRUCIAL TO ATTRACT CORPORATIONS AND ENSURE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE BLUE BOND MARKET. © 2023 BY THE AUTHORS.",NA,"F.

THE PAPER PROVIDES A DEFINITION OF MARITIME MULTI-USE AND IDENTIFIES THE MULTI-USES WITH THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL IN EU SEA BASINS. IN EACH SEA BASIN, MULTI-USE PLAYS A DIFFERENT ROLE AS CONCERNS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE EASTERN BALTIC SEA, THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND THE BLACK SEA, THE MU FOCUS SHOULD REMAIN ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PILLAR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN THE NORTH SEA, NORTH ATLANTIC AND WESTERN BALTIC SEA, ADDRESSING SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY SEEMS A KEY PRECONDITION FOR SUCCESS OF MU IN ENHANCEMENT OF SUSTAINABLE SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT AT SEA. MOREOVER, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO INTRODUCE MU KEY GLOBAL STRATEGIES SUCH AS SDGS OR MACROREGIONAL STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS AND TO SUPPLEMENT MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING WITH SECTORAL INCENTIVES AND EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS AS KEY VEHICLES SUPPORTING MU. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING ASPECTS WHICH, IN ORDER TO INFORM MARITIME SPATIAL PLANNING AND MARITIME GOVERNANCE REGARDING A MORE CONSCIOUS APPLICATION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CONCEPT, REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION. KEY TASKS ARE RELATED TO: MORE PROFOUND EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE OF POLICIES SUPPORTING MUS, RESEARCHING THE IMPACT OF MU ON SOCIETAL GOALS AND ON THE MU COSTS AND BENEFITS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL ONES, AND FINALLY IDENTIFYING THE IMPACT OF MU ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS SECTORS AND REGIONS ON LAND. © 2021 BY THE AUTHOR.

THEREFORE, CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF THIS PIVOTAL AQUATIC MACRO-SYSTEM IS NECESSARY, THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF MONITORING METH-ODOLOGIES. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A PREDICTION MODEL FOR HEAVY METALS ACCUMULATION IN BIOLOGICAL TISSUES, BASED ON FIELD GATHERED DATA WHICH USES BIOINDICATORS (FISH) AND OXIDATIVE STRESS (OS) BIOMARKERS. SAMPLES OF WATER AND FISH WERE COLLECTED FROM THE LOWER SECTOR OF DANUBE RIVER (DR), DANUBE DELTA (DD) AND BLACK SEA (BS). THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS WERE ANALYZED IN SAMPLES: CADMIUM (CD), LEAD (PB), IRON (FE), ZINC (ZN), COPPER (CU) (IN WATER AND FISH TISSUES), RESPECTIVELY, CATALASE (CAT), SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD), GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE (GPX), MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) (IN FISH TISSUES). THE POLLUTION INDEX (PI) WAS CALCULATED TO IDENTIFY THE MOST POLLUTED STUDIED ECOSYSTEM, WHICH REVEALED THAT DANUBE RIVER IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF FE (IP = 4887) AND STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ZN (IP = 4.49). THE CONCENTRATION OF CD IN FISH MUSCLE TISSUE WAS ABOVE THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED LEVEL (0.05 ΜG/G) BY THE EU REGULA-TION. FROM ALL ANALYZED OS BIOMARKERS, MDA REGISTERED THE HIGHEST MEDIAN VALUES IN FISH MUSCLE (145.7 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN DR, 201.03 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN DD, 148.58 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN BS) AND FISH LIVER (200.28 NMOL/MG PROTEIN IN DR, 163.67 NMOL/MG PROTEIN, 158.51 NMOL/MG PROTEIN), COM-PARED TO CAT, SOD AND GPX. THE PREDICTION OF CD, PB, ZN, FE AND CU IN FISH HEPATIC AND MUSCLE TISSUE WAS DETERMINED BASED ON CAT, SOD, GPX AND MDA, BY USING NON-LINEAR TREE-BASED RF PREDICTION MODELS. THE ANALYSIS EMPHASIZES THAT MDA IN HEPATIC TISSUE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INDE-PENDENT VARIABLE FOR PREDICTING HEAVY METALS IN FISH MUSCLE AND TISSUES AT BS COAST, FOLLOWED BY GPX IN BOTH HEPATIC AND MUSCLE TISSUES. THE RF ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK REVEALED THAT CAT IN MUSCLE TISSUE, RESPECTIVELY, MDA AND GPX IN HEPATIC TISSUES ARE MOST COMMON PREDICTORS FOR DETERMINING THE HEAVY METALS CONCENTRATION IN BOTH MUSCLE AND HEPATIC TISSUES IN DD AREA. FOR DR, THE MDA IN MUSCLE, FOLLOWED BY MDA IN HEPATIC TISSUE ARE THE MAIN PREDICTORS IN RF ANALYSIS. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS. LICENSEE MDPI, BASEL, SWITZERLAND.",NA,"I.-A.

HOWEVER, CLIMATE CHANGE REPRESENTS A MAIN BARRIER TO FULLY REALIZING A BE. ENABLING CONDITIONS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF A BE AND INCREASE ITS CLIMATE RESILIENCY MUST BE PROMOTED. ROMANIA HAS HIGH POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EU BE DUE TO ITS GEO-GRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, NAMELY THE PRESENCE OF THE DANUBE DELTA–BLACK SEA MACROSYSTEM, WHICH IS PART OF THE ROMANIAN LOWER DANUBE EUROREGION (RLDE). AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES REPRESENT A SECTOR WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF THE BE IN THE RLDE, A SITUATION WHICH IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS FOR BOTH HALTING BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND MAINTAINING THE PROPER CONDITIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE EXISTING MACROSYSTEM. IT IS KNOWN THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS, ACCENTUATES WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS AND LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY AND INDUCES THE DESTRUCTION OF HABITATS, WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO FISH STOCK DEPLETION. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON MULTIPLE LINEAR PREDICTIVE AND FORECAST MODELS THAT OFFERS COST‐EFFICIENT TOOLS FOR THE MONITORING AND CONTROL OF WATER QUALITY, FISH STOCK DYNAMICS AND BIODIVERSITY IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY OF THE BE OF THE RLDE IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE FOLLOWING WATER‐DEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE CONSIDERED: TOTAL NITROGEN (TN); TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP); DISSOLVED OXYGEN (DO); PH; WATER TEMPERATURE (WT); AND WATER LEVEL, ALL OF WHICH WERE MEASURED BASED ON A SERIES OF 26 PHYSICOCHEMICAL INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH 4 SAMPLING AREAS WITHIN THE RLDE (BRĂILA, GALAȚI, TULCEA AND SULINA COUNTIES). PREDICTIVE MODELS BASED ON FISH SPECIES CATCHES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GALATI COUNTY DANUBE RIVER BASIN SEGMENT AND THE ʺDANUBE DELTA” BIOSPHERE RESERVE ADMINISTRATION TERRITORY WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH AN EFFICIENT TOOL FOR MONITORING FISH STOCK DYNAMICS AND STRUCTURES AS WELL AS IDENTIFY METHODS OF CONTROLLING FISH BIODIVERSITY IN THE RLDE TO ENHANCE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE OF THE ALREADY‐EXISTING BE AND ITS EXPANSION (BLUE GROWTH) IN THE CONTEXT OF AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE VARIATION. THE STUDY AREA REFLECTS THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF THE EMERGING BE, FOCUSED ON THE OCEAN, SEAS, LAKES AND RIVERS ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS AGENDA. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZED THE VULNERABILITY OF THE RLDE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, A SITUATION REVEALED BY THE WATER LEVEL, AIR TEMPERATURE AND WATER QUALITY PARAMETER TREND LINES AND FORECAST MODELS. CONSIDERING THE SAMPLING DESIGN APPLIED WITHIN THE RLDE, IT CAN BE STATED THAT THE TULCEA COUNTY DANUBE SECTOR WAS LESS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE COMPARED WITH THE GALAȚI COUNTY SECTOR AS CONFIRMED BY WATER TN AND TP FORECAST ANALYSIS, WHICH REVEALED HIGHER INCREASING TRENDS IN GALAȚI COMPARED WITH TULCEA. THE FISH STOCK BIODIVERSITY WAS PROVEN TO BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL WARMING WITHIN THE RLDE, SINCE PEACEFUL SPECIES HAD A HIGHER UPWARD TREND COMPARED WITH PREDATORY SPECIES. WATER LEVEL AND AIR TEMPERATURE FORECASTING ANALYSIS PROVED TO BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MONITORING IN THE STUDY AREA. THE RESULTING ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK CONFIRMED THAT TIME SERIES METHODS COULD BE USED TOGETHER WITH MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION METHODS TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR SYNERGETIC ABILITIES FOR MONITORING AND PREDICTING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE MARINE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE BE SECTOR WITHIN THE RLDE. THE FORECASTING MODELS DEVELOPED IN THE PRESENT STUDY WERE MEANT TO BE USED AS METHODS OF REVEALING FUTURE INFORMATION, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR DECISION MAKERS TO ADOPT PROPER MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT OR LIMIT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE BE. THROUGH THE IDENTIFIED INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, PREDICTION MODELS OFFER A SOLUTION FOR MANAGING THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING LESS COST‐DEMANDING AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT MONITORING ACTIVITIES. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

CURRENT SOLUTIONS FOR NUTRIENT NEUTRALITY IN THE UK TAKE A NARROW LAND-FOCUSED APPROACH THAT FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENTS TO MITIGATE NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT. WE PROPOSE THAT MARINE NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS OFFER AN ECONOMICALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO TERRESTRIAL SCHEMES, THAT CAN REDUCE THE NITROGEN LOADING TO THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, INCREASE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVISION AND INCREASE BIODIVERSITY. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.",NA,"A.D.

WE REVIEW THE EXPLORATORY SYSTEM AND CLASSIFY THE STAKEHOLDERS AND DRIVING FORCES BEHIND NATURE EXPLOITATION. BASED ON SUCCESSFUL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CASES, WE PROPOSE PRACTICAL MODIFICATIONS FOR ADDING ECONOMIC VALUE TO RESTORING COLLAPSED ECOSYSTEMS, RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLUE MANAGEMENT. BLUE MANAGEMENT ISOLATES SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS NATURE EXPLOITERS, GOVERNMENTAL BODIES, AND NATURE SCIENTISTS. WE PROPOSE THE DIVISION OF NATURE USERS INTO LARGE FOOTPRINTING COMPANIES (FUNDERS), NATURAL RESOURCES EXPLOITERS INDUSTRY (MANAGERS), AND SUBSISTENCE EXPLOITERS (WORKFORCE) AND EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NATURE EXPLOITERS AND NATURAL SCIENTISTS TO ACCELERATE THE RESTORATION OF THREATENED NATURAL RESOURCES. BLUE MANAGEMENT OFFERS STAKEHOLDERS PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES FOR IMPROVING COLLAPSED/THREATENED NATURAL ASSETS (ECOSYSTEMS) BASED ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ECOLOGICAL THEORIES. IT PROVIDES A SUMMARIZED PATHWAY FOR DECISION-MAKERS TO RESTORE UNPRODUCTIVE RESOURCES, AVOIDING THE MIGRATION OF THE EXPLORATORY SYSTEM TO NEW PRISTINE RESOURCES. IN SUMMARY, BLUE MANAGEMENT IS A PRACTICAL APPROACH THAT COMBINES ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ECOLOGICAL THEORIES TO RESTORE THREATENED ECOSYSTEMS. IT OFFERS DECISION-MAKERS A PATHWAY TO RESTORE UNPRODUCTIVE RESOURCES WHILE AVOIDING THE EXPLOITATION OF NEW PRISTINE RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, BLUE MANAGEMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS RELATED TO NATURE RESTORATION.

AS THE UN DECADE OF OCEAN SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OPENS, THIS BOOK PROVIDES A TIMELY REMINDER OF THE RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND POTENTIAL OF COASTAL AND MARINE SPACES. IT ADVANCES GEOGRAPHICAL AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE BLUE ECONOMY AND SETS A BASELINE FOR CONTINUED SCHOLARLY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE BLUE ECONOMY FROM A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES. THIS TIMELY CONTRIBUTION WILL BE OF INTEREST TO POLICY MAKERS, ACADEMICS, INDUSTRY LEADERS, DECISION MAKERS, AND STAKEHOLDERS WORKING IN OR CONNECTED TO THE BLUE ECONOMY SPHERE AND WORKING IN THE FIELDS OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY, REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC POLICY AND PLANNING, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, AND COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT. © 2023 SELECTION AND EDITORIAL MATTER, C.
