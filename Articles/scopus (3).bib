	abstract = {Arctic observations are becoming increasingly valuable as researchers investigate climate change and its associated concerns, such as decreasing sea ice and increasing ship traffic. Networks of sensors with frequent sampling capabilities are needed to run forecast models, improve navigation, and inform climate research. Sampling frequency and deployment duration are currently constrained by battery power limitations. In-situ power generation using marine renewable energy sources such as waves and currents can be used to circumvent this constraint. Wave and current resources vary spatially and temporally in the Arctic, with some locations and seasons being better suited for marine renewable energy power generation. Locations and seasons with small resources may still be able to use marine renewable energy because of the low power requirements of the instruments. In this study, we describe the wave and current resources in the Arctic, outline the electricity generation developments that are needed to utilize the resources, and suggest use cases. Wave and current energy converters developed to power observations in the Arctic could also be used to power observations at lower latitudes. Marine renewable energy has the potential to decrease dependence on batteries and improve data collection capabilities in the Arctic; however, this would require the development of new low power technologies that can operate in extreme Arctic environments.

The blue economy promotes sustainable wild seafood harvest, carbon-neutral aquaculture production, and new seafood technologies (both plant-and cell-based) that supplement demand for food from the sea and have the potential to reduce overfishing that exceeds scientifically determined maximum sustainable yields (MSY) and degrades marine ecosystems. It replaces fossil fuels with renewable energy, such as offshore wind power and wave and tidal energy systems, and encourages non-consumptive ocean uses. These activities encourage and enable people to think creatively about jobs and career possibilities centered on the sustainable and renewable use of marine resources. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Ana K.

	abstract = {Nature-Based Solutions (NbS), a concept introduced in the late 2000s, has developed rapidly during the last years and is now frequently appearing in a broad spectrum of policies developed within the European Union. Its role in marine policies and research programmes is however still limited, but is likely to increase as NbS are adopted as key terminology in both biodiversity strategies and the EU taxonomy for sustainable financing. This will enhance the need for scientific advisory institutions to provide evidence-based advice on potential impacts of various combinations of marine NbS. To facilitate a critical debate about the prospects and pitfalls related to the operationalisation of marine NbS in an EU context, this paper provides an analysis of core definitions, potential categories of marine NBS and a suite of case studies. Coastal waters, shelf and open oceans present multiple options for testing new and scaling up known NbS, which could support both environmental restoration simultaneously with addressing multiple societal challenges, paving the way for a new level of ecosystem-based management. However, as the acceptance of NbS types will depend on ecosystem state and thus history, it will be a significant task to consistently communicate why some solutions may count as a NbS in some areas, while not in others. To conclude, the paper therefore raises a set of research priorities and policy advice aimed at ensuring the successful advice and deployment of marine NBS in support of multiple societal goals. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The current study provided a socioeconomic quantification of small-scale inland fisheries in East Africa using fish market information data for major markets in the pre (2009–2017) and post COVID-19 containment (Jan–May 2022) eras. The socioeconomic status index (SEI) incorporated 6 dimensions: access to fresh fish, access to market, available fish processing (drying) infrastructure, favourable price range, high quantity range traded, and high seasonal profit margins; using three major commercial fishes (Nile perch, Tilapia and Dagaa) and the season (pre and post COVID-19) as the main independent variables. The SEI was calculated using a segmented sociometric scale interval as: ≥ 4.21Very High ≤5.00; ≥3.41 High ≤4.20; ≥2.61 Moderate ≤3.40; ≥1.81 Low ≤2.60; and ≤1.00 Very Low ≤1.80. The socioeconomic quantification was highly dependent on COVID-19 containment periods that reflected very high (pre COVID-19 = 4.67, post COVID-19 = 4.06) impacts on small-scale inland fisheries. This suggested a negative impact of COVID-19 on small-scale inland fisheries attributed to various factors such as disrupted value chains, reduced purchasing power among the customers, struggles by businesses to compensate for losses incurred during the pandemic, and diversion of economic focus. The impact had a lower proportion on Dagaa, given its low value compared to the other two major commercial species. The quantification of fish data during a pandemic is useful to provide mitigation measures for shocks that could be anticipated in the sector for sustainable fish-food systems. © 2022 The Author(s)},

This intensification is affecting the livelihoods of small-scale fishers, processors, and traders by depleting local fishery resources, damaging fishing gears, putting fishers' lives at risk, and compromising market systems and value chain positions. In this article, we outline the experiences, perspectives, and narratives of the small-scale fishing actors in Ghana. Drawing on qualitative interview data, we examine the relationship between small-scale and industrial fisheries in Ghana using political ecology and sustainable livelihood approaches. We demonstrate how industrialised, capital-intensive fishing has disrupted the economic and social organisation of local fishing communities, affecting incomes, causing conflicts, social exclusion and disconnection, and compromising the social identity of women. These cumulative impacts and disruptions in Ghana's coastal communities have threatened the viability of small-scale fisheries, yet coastal fishing actors have few capabilities to adapt. We conclude by supporting recommendations to reduce the number and capacity of industrial vessels, strictly enforce spatial regulations, and ensure "blue justice" against marginalisation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of Marine Macroalgal Waste (MMW) - drifted marine macroalgae - is a growing phenomenon. The lack of appropriate management protocols for this residual biomass leaves it mostly unmanaged or disposed of in landfills. Such inappropriate solutions lead to negative environmental impacts, health concerns and coastal degradation, representing an opportunity to develop the bioeconomy. Although a relevant number of studies exists on the use of edible marine macroalgae for several purposes, there is generally a lack of information concerning MMW valorisation, at both local and global scales. This review thus explores the ecological and biotechnological potential for the establishment of a new approach for MMW valorisation based in the circular and blue economies. It is supported in literature on the use of residual biomass whenever possible and also includes studies with fresh biomass to extrapolate, considering known characteristics of MMW; consequently, a roadmap for its utilisation is provided. The review includes characteristics of various seaweeds, MMW accumulation worldwide and traditional uses, together with the development of alternative and integrated valorisation strategies. By analysing a large number of studies, it was possible to perceive a clear potential to explore MMW to obtain renewable fuels, especially biogas and bioethanol and for use in agricultural activities. Allied to this, the extraction of value-added compounds, such as lipids, pigments, phenolic compounds and specific polysaccharides is highlighted, aiming to contribute to the development of an economically feasible zero-waste biorefinery approach. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

The purpose of this study is to analyze the opportunities and difficulties associated with the cultivation of neon tetra fish in order to build a policy of “Blue Economy”. The research method uses qualitative techniques, focusing on an evaluation of literature reviews and data collection techniques sourced from descriptive materials. The key elements selected were: (1) the Department of Food and Fisheries Security (DKP3), as the Board of Trustees (2) Researchers from BRIN (National Innovation Research Agency), (3) Government (Sub-districts and Kelurahan), (4) POKDAKAN (Fish Cultivation Group) and (5) LPM (Community Empowerment Institution) and Chairman of RW/RT. The conclusion of the study states that the relevant Dinas should support local policies based on nature identification that are strengthened at the national level, namely that routine human resource training needs to be improved, technology needs to be taken into account in collaboration with the private sector, and that post-harvest and market access are very important for POKDAKAN. The findings of the SWOT analysis, which is in quadrant 1, indicate that POKDAKAN is in a position for a somewhat aggressive expansion. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Environmental concerns have become important in the shipbuilding industry. The concept of the Blue Economy was linked to a new model of economic development based on regeneration, where the production of waste is seen as the possibility of creating a new activity, product, and employment. Nowadays, when we talk about the Blue Economy, it is from a much more transversal perspective, deeply linked to the maritime economic sectors. The aim is to develop these coastal productive sectors from a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable point of view. Due to the great development that the Blue Economy has experienced in recent years, it is considered appropriate to carry out a study of this economic model in the port sector. For this reason, this article analyses the Spanish port system, determining the most important dimensions for measuring the degree of development of the Blue Economy and indicators for each of them. It is concluded that the main emerging sectors in the Blue Economy are biotechnology, research and education, sustainable infrastructures and gastronomy and tradition. The final result of this article is the development of a tool which, by introducing certain data, provides the degree of implementation or development of the Blue Economy both at a general level for the port and at a specific level for each dimension. © 2022 by the authors.},

As a case study, the subject research focuses on the significance of changing from a green economy to a blue economy while stressing Pakistan's blue economy's potential and problems. Pakistan has failed to maximize the use of its abundant resources. Due to several obstacles confronted by Pakistan, the blue economy's resources are not being harnessed, as indicated by the data gathered throughout this topic study. This is a fallacy; in reality, these obstacles are already being overcome. The underlying reason these resources are not being utilized is a lack of will at all levels. Lack of nautical expertise and the capacity to see the sea, or "sea blindness," is seen to be the biggest obstacle to the development of Pakistan's marine industry. Islamic nations must agree on a plan to move from the Green Economy to the Blue Economy so that musharka, ijar, and sukuk can be used to meet future needs. © 2022, The Running Line.

	abstract = {Marine microalgae accumulate numerous compounds with commercial value including carotenoids, proteins, biopolymers, and lipids, making them attractive feedstocks to produce diverse bioproducts including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, animal feed, and biofuel. With the emerging concepts of “Blue Economy” and “Blue Biotechnology”, marine microalgae can be employed to achieve sustainability in numerous industries. Nonetheless, microalgae-based production processes are still not considered economically feasible owing to the high costs associated with cultivation and biomass processing. To mitigate the costs associated with the production process, the concept of marine microalgae-based biorefining has emerged where a single feedstock is employed to produce several distinct bioproducts, each with commercial value. Marine microalgae-based biorefineries could be made economically feasible by incorporating both high-value and low-value bio-compounds in the production line, whereas utilization of wastewater and flue gases as alternative nutrient sources for the cultivation can make the process more sustainable. Nonetheless, several challenges are associated with marine microalgae-based biorefinery, which necessitate the attention of future researchers to make this concept a reality. Hence, the present review provides a comprehensive discussion on the biorefinery of marine microalgae in view of producing diverse metabolites using a single feedstock while providing valuable insight into the directions of future research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The European Union (EU) promotes a sustainable blue economy in the coastal and marine regions. In Finland, the regional development objectives are defined at the national and regional levels. Maritime spatial planning (MSP) is a tool to reconcile the sea's different uses. This study considers developing collaborative practices in regional planning to help meet regional development objectives. The MSP participants representing the coastal fishery (fishing and fish farming) in the Satakunta region, Finland, exemplify a local stakeholder group. Coastal fishery is a demanding and highly regulated livelihood, with the potential to grow as local food is trending. A mixed-method approach was used to examine MSP participants’ and fishery experts’ perceptions about regional cooperation and the MSP process. The semi-structured interviews focused on three main themes: regional cooperation and synergies, conflicts and threats, and interest in regional collaboration or establishing secondary businesses. Questionnaires 2019 and 2021 examined stakeholders’ engagement (intrinsic motivation) and social trust towards the planners in the MSP process. The need to tackle the challenges of coastal fishery dictates coastal fishery participants’ perceptions regarding the fishery business's development in a regional context. Despite the collaborative approach, the first Finnish MSP round did not make a significant difference in the coastal fishery's status as a stakeholder group. MSP processes and developing the sustainable blue economy are part of the regional development framework, requiring a level playing field and mutual trust among stakeholders. The regional development of marine and coastal areas would benefit from a joint forum for stakeholder interaction built upon MSP. Collaboration could strengthen the integrative and comprehensive management of sea uses and resources. © 2022 The Authors},

This is juxtaposed against India's ambitious blue economy targets and policy thrust that pin on the expansion of mariculture as a promising avenue for enhancing marine fish production. Farm-level, region-specific, techno-economic, and socio-cultural factors associated with, and conditional on, sustainable intensification of mariculture-based production systems are examined in detail. The Principles-Criteria-Indicators (PCI) approach is used to establish the linkage between identified farm-level indicators and various dimensions of sustainability. While the selected enterprises were assessed to be technically and economically viable in general, glaring gaps were evident on key indicators of sustainability such as the legitimacy of access over water bodies, use of quality seed and feed, institutional credit access, market access, and fair marketing practices, optimal stocking density, mechanization, use of renewable energy, adoption of environmental-friendly culture practices, farm surveillance, crew safety, and social protection. This indicates the need for taking proactive measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of mariculture, particularly in the initial stages of establishment when such interventions are easy to adopt. Based on the insights obtained from the analysis, a broad set of strategies, policy options, and institutional interventions critical to scaling-up coastal mariculture enterprises along the east and west coasts of India are presented.

	abstract = {Island governments have made decent work and social protection their highest policy priority, aiming to link them to the so-called blue economy sectors such as fisheries. The development of small-scale commercial fishing is primarily driven by transnational fisheries trade and depends on dive fisher labour force facing issues with deficits in decent work, health and safety, and safety at sea provisions. Given the macro-policy priorities for decent work in the transition of small island developing states (SIDS) to blue economy, this paper examines the development interventions in small-scale commercial fisheries trade that have exacerbated unsafe marine working conditions of dive fishers. Despite significant investments in developing commercial fisheries trade, the mismatch between macro-level decisions and micro-level labour needs has hardly been explored via the blue economy and sustainable development goal interlinkages. This study used a qualitative research approach to examine the unsafe working conditions of dive fishers and examined why dive-related accidents and fatalities occur in commercial fisheries in the first place. A systematic approach in the analysis of diving accidents helps the study to, firstly, highlight the gaps between macro policy and practice at the national and global levels. Secondly, the approach helps explore the need for a coherent approach to policy integration that bridges the gap between the macro and operational levels of small-scale fisheries labour force. The study analyses the International Labour Organization’s decent work instruments with SIDS sustainable development priorities for fisheries workforce and points out that governments must be responsible at the macro level for managing accidents at sea and building a safe diving workforce through competent marine and diving authorities.

	abstract = {New approaches to ocean governance for coastal communities are needed. With few exceptions, the status quo does not meet the diverse development aspirations of coastal communities or ensure healthy oceans for current and future generations. The blue economy is expected to grow to USD2.5–3 trillion by 2030, and there is particular interest in its potential to alleviate poverty in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, and to support a blue recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a selective, thematic review of the blue economy literature to examine: (i) the opportunities and risks for coastal communities, (ii) the barriers and enablers that shape community engagement, and (iii) the strategies employed by communities and supporting organizations, which can be strengthened to deliver a ‘sustainable' blue economy and improve social justice for coastal communities. Our review finds that under business-as-usual and blue growth, industrial fisheries, large-scale aquaculture, land reclamation, mining, and oil and gas raise red flags for communities and marine ecosystems. Whereas, if managed sustainably, small-scale fisheries, coastal aquaculture, seaweed farming and eco-tourism are the most likely to deliver benefits to communities. Yet, these are also the sectors most vulnerable to negative and cumulative impacts from other sectors. Based on our evaluation of enablers, barriers and strategies, the paper argues that putting coastal communities at the center of a clear vision for an inclusive Sustainable Blue Economy and co-developing a shared and accessible language for communities, practitioners and policy-makers is essential for a more equitable ocean economy, alongside mainstreaming social justice principles and integrated governance that can bridge different scales of action and opportunity.

	abstract = {Carbon sequestration of blue carbon ecosystems worldwide is as high as 237.6 Tg C/a. China is one of the countries with the most resources of blue carbon, with carbon sequestration of 0.835 Tg C/a. To develop blue economy and facilitate the fulfillment of carbon neutrality, it is of great significance for China to build the blue carbon trading market (BCTM). This paper aimed to improve the participation probability of stakeholders to construct an effective BCTM through evolutionary game theory. First, we constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model including the governments, the suppliers of blue carbon (SBC) and the demanders of blue carbon (DBC), based on the corresponding cost and benefit in BCTM. To further reveal the factors affecting the cooperation of above parties, we analyzed the sensitivity of the stakeholders through five parameters, i.e., proportion of subsidies, unit carbon tax, blue carbon credits, unit price of blue carbon credits, and the cost of carbon emission reduction unit. To verify the game model, a case study of blue carbon credits of mangrove trading was performed. The main conclusions are as follows. In the initial stage of BCTM, the governments need to play a leading role in regulating and incentivizing motivation of the SBC and DBC. Subsidies and carbon taxes are conducive to promoting BCTM to develop into the middle stage. In the middle stage, price and quota of BC credits are two primary parameters to affect the evolutionary results of above three groups. Thus, it's necessary for the governments to adjust these parameters in time. When the trading scale and operation mode of BCTM approaching stable, the market will enter into the mature stage. Then, the governments can reduce subsidies to save fiscal expenditure and lessen the intervention, so as to gradually withdraw from the market. The above conclusions can provide a theoretical basis and reference for the construction of efficient BCTM and promote the integration of blue carbon into the carbon market in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In Ghana, the Marine Pollution Act 2016 (Act, 932) was promulgated to prevent, regulate and control pollution within Ghana’s territorial waters. Meanwhile, the health of Ghana’s oceans keeps deteriorating. This paper aims to develop an integrative model to enhance BEI through Sustainable Supply Chain Performance (SSCP) by integrating competing theories to attract sustainable investment to conserve and make sustainable use of marine resources. We anchored our study on quantitative research approach and a cross-sectional survey data. Our hypotheses have been tested using variance-based Structural Equation Modeling and SMART-PLS version 3.3.1. The study has revealed that organisational factors, technological factors, supply chain risk, green environmental awareness, perceived cost and regulatory environment are significant determinants of BEI. Moreover, BEI significantly drives SSCP. Again, BEI significantly mediates the relation between its determinants and SSCP. The implications include the emergence of an integrated model which could be used to improve marine resources investment and the realisation of Sustainable Development Goals 3, 13 and 14. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Uranium extraction from seawater (UES) efficiency is limited by the material design, such as U-selective binding sites, their uniform distribution, surface area exposure, diffusivity, and stability. Herein, we report a U-selective single-component hydrogen-bonded organic framework (CSMCRIHOF-1) of phenoxy-imine synthons conjugated to pyridyl tectons with varied pore dimensions of ∼3.6—∼3.8 Å, resulting in flow-through channels and 328 m2/g BET surface area. The CSMCRIHOF-1 shows a 3D robust network of hydrogen bonds (O−H···O, C−H···O, and O−H···N) supported by π-π stacking, exhibiting excellent hydrolytic stability under broad pH range (pH 1–10). Relative to other framework materials, the CSMCRIHOF-1 is easily processable and regenerable. Further processing of CSMCRIHOF-1 yields large-area free-standing thin films (TFCHs) of tunable thickness from 40 to 500 nm with enhanced surface area (550 m2/g). TFCH shows significant UES capacities of ∼11 mg/g within 5 days and 17.9 mg/g in 30 days from natural seawater. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Amid funding shortfalls to address ongoing ocean degradation, blue bonds are being designed to finance sustainable development and conservation projects in ocean and coastal areas via private sector investment. Blue bonds seek to deliver both positive environmental and/or social impact alongside a financial return on investment to investors. However, there has been limited academic scrutiny of these early initiatives to evaluate whether this rhetoric is justified. This article leverages 15-years of scholarship on green bonds to develop an analytical framework that is applied to five of the world's first blue bonds. A comprehensive content analysis of sources such as blue bond project documents and secondary interviews is used to synthesise their characteristics, and consider trends related to their thematic scope, geographical scope, environmental impacts, and financial returns. Thematically, blue bond proceeds are channelled towards projects aligned with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 ‘Life Below Water’, the Blue Economy, and policy discourse around the ‘blue recovery’ from covid-19. These projects range from marine protected area (MPA) creation, to improved fisheries management, and potentially, oil and gas exploration. However, greater explanation of the logic through which project activities are expected to deliver impact and returns is warranted. Equally, impact measurement is often underwhelming, with many bonds targeting easy-to-measure outputs (e.g., area conserved) rather than outcomes and impacts (e.g., increases in fish abundance). While an alluring and useful financial innovation, greater disclosure on the individual projects and enterprises that blue bonds finance is necessary to validate their sustainability credentials and inform investor decision making. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This chapter explores the opportunities and challenges in promoting blue finance in enhancing a sustainable blue economy through the adoption of coastal and maritime tourism (CMT) in the Asia-Pacific region. Extant literature indicates various challenges in developing CMT in developing countries, including insufficient financing in this sector. Hence, this chapter aims to investigate how blue finance can promote sustainable development in developing countries. A conceptual framework is proposed, linking blue finance and sustainable development through strengthening the emerging blue economy, particularly by promoting sustainable CMT which can facilitate the conservation of the coastal and marine environment by transforming coastal communities into resilient communities. This chapter aims to draw some policy guidelines which might be useful for policymakers to focus on sustainable CMT as a means to stimulate the green economy through green finance and foster sustainable development. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

The tensions inherent in the idea that the marine environment can be both exploited for human use and protected for its intrinsic natural values, reflect the origins of the concept of sustainable development itself and these are explored in the chapters presented in this section. These cover an examination of the ethics and values underpinning the blue economy, the role that blue finance can play in advancing sustainable development, particularly for tourism and local communities dependent on the oceans for their wellbeing. The views of various stakeholders on the quality and legitimacy of the governance of a range of blue economy initiatives are also explored, as is the extent to which, philosophically speaking, ocean development can be understood as genuinely sustainable, whatever the rhetoric may be.

	abstract = {Sustainable development, finance and related global policies and mechanisms have evolved over the decades. Today, regional initiatives for classifying sustainable activities exist, and several decades' research and development of ecosystem services and natural capital have identified and tested alternative economic models. The World Bank has the potential to finance them and sustainability at the landscape scale is achievable. But economic and environmental values can come into conflict. In developing countries, sustainable alternatives exist in business activities such as coastal and marine tourism. Financing small businesses through sound digital infrastructure is critical, as is the use of public fiscal instruments for the sustainable use of natural resources. Despite its developed status, renewable energy policies in the EU are leading to forest destruction. Financial vehicles such as green bonds have a similar potential. To avoid greenwashing, more focus needs to be on meeting the needs of those at the base of the economic pyramid, resourcing them with smart technologies and valuing civic engagement. Climate finance must be ethical and its allocation have integrity; this will foster community resilience. To avoid repeating the mistakes of terrestrial development, the world's oceans need to be protected and new business models adopted in this expanding frontier. Now is the time for all sectors to create a sustainable future for the planet and its inhabitants in the post-COVID, postcarbon era to come. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {It is generally agreed that the blue economy and blue growth play important roles in the global economy; over the last few years, they have been widely discussed at both national and international levels. Nevertheless, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure them, as the accounting methodologies differ between studies, implying divergent results. This article summarizes previous studies by comparing blue economy accounting methodologies and highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Based on the comparison, a new methodology is proposed, based primarily on micro- and country-specific local data; this new methodology has been applied to measure the size of the blue economy in Poland. The results show that previous analyses have slightly underestimated the size of the blue economy in Poland, despite similarities concerning general dynamics and sectoral structure over time. The study concludes that a trade-off exists between using existing one-size-fits-all methods and country-specific methods, with a more precise, tailored approach being achieved at the expense of the accuracy of cross-country comparisons. Finally, the study highlights that, as there is no unambiguous solution to the problem of the above trade-off, different methods should be used with regard to the choice of method depends on the specific research task to be carried out or policy question to be addressed.

	abstract = {The blue economy contributes significantly to the creation of the Atlantic Area’s identity. In addition, the search for outdoor experiences after the COVID-19 lockdown suspensions has renewed the popularity of nautical tourism in this area and in the world. Despite the negative effects of the economic crisis on tourism, evidence suggests that some tourist destinations in the Atlantic area are resilient. Thus, whereas some branches of the blue economy face considerable challenges to increasing competitiveness, others offer opportunities for economic growth and employment. In this context, investment is necessary to lay the foundations for the sustainable development of nautical tourism. However, regarding the role of investment in productivity and competitiveness in the context of crisis, there is no consensus among academics. Thus, we investigate whether the investment contributed to competitiveness in nautical tourism in the Atlantic Area in 2016–2020. We collected data from ORBIS for 29 nautical-tourism companies and performed a quantitative and qualitative narrative analysis of competitiveness indicators, enabling comparisons pre and during crisis. The results highlight the multiplicity of ways in which crisis impacts nautical-tourism firms. The research fills a gap in the literature by investigating the dynamic capabilities of nautical-tourism SMEs in periods of recession, with a special focus on restructuring and competitiveness strategies. Some recommendations are outlined to promote the efficiency of resources and stimulate the competitiveness of companies to allow the regional development of nautical tourism in the territory of the Atlantic area. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This collection of essays provides a rich and contemporary discussion of the principle of pacta sunt servanda. This principle, which requires that valid agreements are to be honoured, is a cornerstone of contract law. Focusing on contributions from Asia, this book shows that, despite its natural and universal appeal, the pacta sunt servanda principle is neither absolute nor immutable. Exceptions to the binding force of contract must be available in limited circumstances to avoid hardship and unfairness. sThis book offers readers new comparative perspectives on the appropriate balance between contractual certainty and flexibility in an era of social instability. Expert authors, mostly from East and Southeast Asia, explore when their domestic legal systems allow exceptions from the binding force of contracts. Doctrines discussed include impossibility, frustration, change of circumstance, force majeure, illegality as well as rights of withdrawal. Other chapters consider the importance of the pacta principle in international law. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic feature strongly in the majority of contributions. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Normann Witzleb. All rights reserved.},

Through a literature review and document analysis, this paper traces the evolution of MSP policy in the region and analyses the plans focusing on the drivers, scale, legislation, authority and spatial outputs. A developing policy framework, increasing political will, the growing Blue Economy development agenda and strong leadership by the OECS Commission have provided the impetus for progress. Further advancement however is threatened by ongoing capacity constraints and questions over plan implementation and the delivery of subsequent planning cycles, with uncertainty over the future direction of MSP in the region.

	abstract = {In conditions of ongoing climate change, multifaceted socio-economic and health crises and constantly increasing energy needs, the transition to clean energy forms is a crucial priority in the development policies of countries worldwide. The debate, which has been held at scientific and political levels since the 1970s, has as key areas of concern the search for renewable energy sources and the development of new allocation methods and technologies for their optimal use aiming at spatial and social cohesion and justice. With a focus on marine renewable energy sources, and taking Greece as reference area, it is explored whether, and under what conditions, marine energy could support blue economy and climate neutrality. This article seeks to critically discuss contemporary international/European experience with a view to assessing the basic factors that have contributed to the use of blue energy, and identifying the special conditions, constraints and priorities in the management of marine energy potential in coastal countries with geographical and spatial peculiarities and high concentration of protected areas (natural - cultural-historical), as is the case of Mediterranean countries. In this line, a methodology is proposed based on a multifactorial perspective where the geopolitical significance, the local identity and the carrying capacity of the sites gain additional value weight. The aim is to highlight crucial issues that need to be addressed in the energy transition of coastal countries, and embedded as principles/guidelines in the broader framework of their national energy policies in the context of climate neutrality. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The history of the terrestrial economy has been one of trial and error in terms of how sustainable or green it may be characterised as being. What lessons can be applied now to avoid some of those errors in the blue economy? Using this comparison as motivation, the chapter will involve a discussion of the concepts of planetary boundaries, ecosystem services and natural capital, the contrasts between domesticated and non-domesticated space; strong and weak sustainability; intrinsic and instrumental environmental values; shallow and deep environmental ethics; and biocentric and anthropocentric conceptual frameworks. The analysis will involve a critical examination of the concept sustainable development drawing on a number of approaches including those motivated by the Brundtland definition of sustainable development (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987). The analysis will also point to a number of examples to illustrate the concepts central to sustainability.

In order to completely address the three dimensions of development, social, economic, and environmental in an integrated manner from 2015 to 2030, and to shift to a sustainable development path, the United Nations has formulated 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), of which SDG14 is directly associated with the blue economy, which is also an essential material foundation for achieving other SDGs. In particular, the blue economy with the theme of sustainable and high-quality development of the marine economy will provide the possibility and important material guarantees for the eradication of poverty (SDG1), the eradication of hunger (SDG2), and the reduction of inequalities within and among countries (SDG10). In this study, CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to visualize and analyze the global blue economy sustainability research field from 2006 to 2021, obtaining institutions, countries, cited authors, cited literature, journals, keywords, and clustered knowledge graphs. The results show that most of the blue economy sustainable development research is independent, with less cooperation among institutions. The research focuses on four research themes: fundamental theory and development direction, ecological and environmental sustainability, marine development methods, and comprehensive benefits and functions; the dynamics of the blue economy sustainable development research field is summarized.

In this paper, global blue economy definition, blue economy potentials, resources, blue economy in fisheries and aquaculture sector, present shrimp cultivation status and blue economy of shrimp cultivation from Bangladesh perspectives have been reviewed. Potential blue economy sectors in Bangladesh are mariculture, deep sea fishing, biotechnology, marine energy, submarine cable connections etc. Blue economy resources are biological resources, government agencies, human resources, ports-harbors, vessels and submarines, in addition to remote sensing facilities. To embrace blue economy, fisheries and aquaculture should include technologies, such as big data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence and precision aquaculture. Shrimp cultivation occurs in Khulna, Chittagong, Cox‟s Bazar, Bhola regions mostly by traditional method. Shrimp pond management, culture practices, harvesting, grading, production, supply and future potential has been addressed. Shrimp production is increasing steadily. Blue economy of shrimp culture involves innovative solutions to settle down unsustainability issues. A conceptual framework addressing major challengaes and sustainable interventions has also been reported. Recommendations are directed to consider government policy declaration, public awareness, coordination among state agencies, establishing national marine data hub, supporting research and development, and employing more manpower, as well as regional and international collaborations. © 2022, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

Yet, the mechanisms and processes of production and transportation of crude petroleum are accompanied by the dispossessing of the adjoining coastal communities of their means of (re)production both on the ocean and on land. Although the insights of agrarian political economy have been deployed fruitfully to analyse land grabs in Africa, similar efforts are rare when it comes to ocean grabs. With reference to the new development thinking on the ocean economy—or ‘blue economy’—as the new frontier of resource-based industrialization in Africa, we re-frame the agrarian question and apply it to the offshore petroleum industry, expanding agrarian political-economic theory of industrialization beyond its traditional confines of land and agriculture. Our paper makes two main theoretical contributions. First, it contributes to efforts in agrarian political economy to incorporate the ocean and fisheries. Second, we contribute a fresh theoretical framework for analysing offshore petroleum industries and their potential to contribute to industrialization in Africa. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Using traditional economy indicators alone does not fully provide a complete understanding of country's relative position in its trade relationships with others. In this study, the concept of country's blue economy status was transformed into an operational definition through complex network method. Considering the influence of the unavoidable spatial correlations between countries in blue product trade, the double-fixed spatial Durbin model was used to analyze the direct effect of blue product structure on the promotion of country's blue economy status and the spatial spillover effect on surrounding countries. The results showed that: (1) There is a significant spatial correlation between countries' blue economy status, meaning that countries are not randomly independent of each other and are also influenced by other regions. (2) Capacity accumulation, advanced, diversified, and rationalized blue product structure all contribute significantly to the uplift of country's blue economy status, but these four blue product structures differ greatly on the spatial spillover effect of surrounding areas. (3) The results of the heterogeneity analysis based on income level also answer questions in previous studies where consistent conclusions could not be reached due to differences in the subjects studied. This research provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for countries to implement differentiated blue product structure optimization policies based on their stage of blue economy development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {This chapter analyses multi-stakeholder perspectives on the governance and sustainability of different blue economy initiatives from both developed and developing countries. The study was conducted in 2020 using an anonymous online survey following an analytical method based on principles, criteria and indicators. Respondents rated the quality of these initiatives on a Likert scale (1-5) based on 11 indicators. The results show that the Sustainable Ocean Initiative received the highest score, while Marine permaculture scored the lowest. blue economy initiatives were considered inclusive by respondents; however, resources and capacity were deemed insufficient. Respondents from the Global South (developing countries) rated the initiatives higher than those from the Global North (developed countries) perhaps because developing countries are the prime beneficiaries of these programmes and receive more funding and assistance. These findings support policy and decision-makers formulating policies based on stakeholders' opinions and focussing on low-scoring initiatives. The blue economy is a growing sector with high potential for sustainable development; however, various factors, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, are obstructing its advancement. Therefore, effective communication, collaborative efforts and substantial and sustainable finance are vital for ensuring the sustainability of the blue economy in both the Global North and the Global South. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Heralded as a key agenda for sustainable ocean development, the blue economy has risen to such prominence over the last decade that it is near impossible to engage in the fields of ocean governance or development without encountering it. The exact nature of the blue economy's sustainable ocean development promise, however, remains stubbornly unresolved, with different actors advancing varying, at times conflicting, visions of what sustainable ocean development should look like, how it is to be achieved, and who it is to serve. Tracing the various constructions of blue economy promises over the last decade, this paper contends that the blue economy has progressively retreated from its early commitment to equitable benefit sharing, shifting instead to a deepening preoccupation with economic growth. For small island developing states (SIDS) and coastal least developed countries (LDCs) who took a leading role in embedding equitable benefit sharing within the blue economy during its early popularization, such retreat raises pressing questions over the agenda's continued suitability in advancing desired (and often much needed) sustainable development outcomes. This paper's attempt to grapple with such questions offers a timely contribution to discussions on the blue recovery and ocean-led development avenues in the wake of COVID-19.

While developing the ocean space sustainably, countries are promoting their economic growth, which is the building block for obtaining economic benefits from the blue economy and promoting blue growth. The development potential of the blue economy in different countries depends not only on the resource endowments they own, but also on the internal- and cross-agent correlation that affects the development of the blue economy. Therefore, this paper qualitatively analyzes this complex system based on a multiagent perspective, proposes a conceptual framework of the national blue economic system, and studies the logical relationships between agents with different attributes and their development mechanism. To provide a scientific policy basis for the systematic and multistandard assessment of the development of a country's blue economy, more interdisciplinary attention is needed and a methodological shift in blue economy studies will be induced in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Large-scale seaweed aquaculture in the ocean is being pursued globally as a solution to many contemporary challenges, including climate change, food security, and ecosystem degradation. However, the required development and transformation of marine systems for farming may have unknown implications for sustainability objectives, such as those outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The aim of this paper is to outline the opportunities for, and threats from, seaweed farming in the context of sustainability. We synthesise the perspectives of expert stakeholders from multiple sectors through a series of Australian workshops to catalogue the pathways through which seaweed farming may affect sustainability, giving specific focus to the SDGs. In doing so, this study illustrates that seaweed farming has the potential to influence, to some degree, the majority of SDGs, with both positive and negative influences. Indeed, seaweed farming is most likely to benefit progress towards achieving SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 12 (Sustainable Production and Consumption), and 15 (Life on Land). But expectations of seaweed farming may also fall short for supporting some goals if appropriate measures are not implemented to mitigate potential impacts, most notably SDG 14 (Life Below Water). We underscore that seaweed farming has the potential to contribute to sustainable development, and that this potential can only be realised with appropriate regulation and mitigation to avoid unwanted negative outcomes. Better identification and management of trade-offs between these potential positive and negative outcomes across sustainability domains, will be critical for realising the full potential of seaweed aquaculture for sustainable development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are viewed as important sources of innovation. While contracts, rules, policies, and industrial standards have been identified as important for coordinating and aligning inter-firm relationships, tools for the collective, collaborative orchestration of ecosystems have yet to be fully identified and articulated by scholars. The core contribution of this paper, the authors contend, is that corporate foresight tools, as applied at the level of the ecosystem, have the potential to orchestrate ecosystems. To this end, the authors examine the practical use of corporate foresight tools, in this case, roadmapping and scenario planning, as employed by ECOPRODIGI, an Interreg Baltic Sea project designed to advance the EU's strategy for eco-efficient Sustainable Blue Economy in the Roll-on/Roll-off (Ro-Ro) shipping ecosystem. Results demonstrate how ecosystem-level foresight significantly differs from traditional foresight centered around a focal firm. Corporate foresight tools, as applied to an ecosystem: 1) Target a diverse set of ecosystem actors beyond the segment's focal firm, including complementary firms, investors, and non-market actors; 2) Engage ecosystem actors, rather than only the focal firm, in shared strategy development based on a diverse mix of foresight tools; and 3) serve to orient and reify the ecosystem by charting the collective anticipation of innovations, policies, etc., in a shared set of future options. In the end, the authors find that corporate foresight tools operate as constitutive elements of ecosystems, that is, the tools help enact the ecosystem not as an abstract concept but as a shared, lived reality. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Large, long-lived marine animals (‘marine megafauna’) are amongst the world's most threatened taxa, primarily due to overfishing. Reducing fisheries' impacts on marine megafauna is particularly challenging in small-scale fisheries (SSFs), where endangered species can have important consumptive use values. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have been proposed as a potential solution, but there is a lack of empirical data on if and how they might work in this context. We present a novel combination of methods – scenario interviews with contingent valuation (CV) – for exploring and designing locally-appropriate PES schemes; and apply these methods to investigate how different types of incentives might influence fisher behaviour and mortality of Critically Endangered taxa in two case study SSFs in Indonesia. Fishers almost unanimously supported positive conditional incentives: 98 % and 96 % of fishers would stop landing hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.) and wedgefish (Rhynchobatus spp.), respectively, in contrast to 1 % and 6 % under a business-as-usual scenario, and 52 % and 46 % in response to a negative incentive (fine). CV results showed that an incentive-based scheme for catch mitigation of all hammerheads and wedgefish across both sites could cost US$71,408–235,927 annually, and save up to 18,500 and 2140 individuals, respectively. This study provides empirical evidence that PES could offer a cost-effective and socially-just approach for marine conservation in SSFs; and offers a scalable method for designing locally-appropriate investment-ready schemes, which could support the delivery of societal goals such as net positive outcomes for marine biodiversity and a sustainable and equitable blue economy. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Therefore, it is necessary to determine the scope of activities that should be carried out for the sustainable development of the blue economy in Poland. It was decided to analyze basic data and indicators to verify whether the Polish maritime and coastal economy meets the goals of the blue economy. During the research, it became apparent that inaccuracies in terminology affect the selection of indicators. Therefore, the definitions and classification of sectors related to the blue economy were verified. Based on the literature review and the available data, the Polish maritime and coastal economy has considerable potential to be transformed into a blue economy. However, major barriers have also been identified, the removal of which requires a systematic approach. Furthermore, the benefits and costs associated with the transformation are highlighted. © 2022 Society for Promotion of Horticulture. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Marine tourism is promoted as a substitute economic activity to unsustainable fishing, which is compatible with conservation. However, benefits of marine tourism do not typically accrue in small-scale fisheries (SSFs), which often bear the costs of conservation; they accrue to tourists and tourist-focussed businesses. We explored how marine tourism levies could operationalise the beneficiary-pays principle and address these cost-benefit inequities using an online contingent valuation (CV) survey to measure international tourists' willingness-to-pay (WTP) towards community-based shark conservation (N = 1033). Levies were widely supported (96%), with median and Turnbull mean WTP of US$ 10–14.99 and $22.02 per person per day, respectively. We combined these results with data from two marine tourism hotspots in Indonesia – Lombok and Pulau Weh – to explore the feasibility of implementing tourism levies to incentivize pro-conservation behaviour in local SSFs. Our conservative estimates indicate that marine tourism levies in Lombok and Pulau Weh could respectively generate US$ 2.3–10 million and US$ 300,000–1.3 million annually – several times greater than the estimated costs of conservation incentives in local SSFs. The marine tourism industry offers an under-utilised revenue stream for marine conservation, which could support policy aspirations such as ‘a sustainable and equitable blue economy’. © 2022 The Authors},

In this review we examine questions of governance and mechanisms for Indigenous participation and inclusion in the distribution of economic benefits, and monitoring and managing environmental and cultural impacts of Blue Economy industries. We suggest a shift in practice of social licence to operate such that consent is granted by Indigenous groups based on their perspective of social licence at all stages of the project life-cycle and at each interface where new social and cultural risks and opportunities emerge. Such a shift in practice across the Blue Economy requires the consideration of multiple collaborative arrangements and a platform for Indigenous driven transformation in how Indigenous Peoples participate in Blue Economy sectors and in business agreements based on their particular historical, social, cultural and economic context and goals. Such as an arrangement centres on new competencies that includes adaptive capacities within the particular blue economic partnership governance systems. © 2022 The Authors},

Funding solutions in carbon markets and public goods often requires non-traditional finance approaches. The Climate Foundation has leveraged non-profit finance over the past decade to support development and validation of marine permaculture design principles, a bold and visionary emerging field that can transform humanity's marine relationships from extraction to regeneration and help address climate change, the regenerative blue economy and sustainable development. This chapter discusses a spectrum of opportunities to leverage capital for marine permaculture development. The three broad areas of funding opportunities discussed comprise philanthropy, emerging forms of decentralised finance, and more conventional forms of commercial fundraising. Also outlined are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to commercialising sustainable solutions while ensuring that governance principles and the core mission remain. This narrative is based largely on the Climate Foundation's experience, including tech funding work from Silicon Valley advancing the development of marine permaculture. The chapter concludes with a summary of funding, noting the different forms of fundraising that are appropriate for different phases of innovation development. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

The project would include the creation of 'innovative special economic zones' which would comprise a part of land (the 'Anchor Zone') and of sea (the 'Floating Islands Zone'). To understand how the Floating Island Project was rationalised, it is essential to consider how it was situated in the broader discourse of 'green growth' and 'blue-green economy' by both seasteaders and the French Polynesian government, and how this discourse was used to make the development of innovative special economic zones desirable. This chapter offers a discursive analysis of both the Floating Island Project as an exercise in 'extrastatecraft' and a libertarian political venture steeped in evolutionary economics and also as a smart, blue-green territorial fix for island nations and coastal cities threatened by the effects of climate change. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2022.

	abstract = {For centuries resource economists have persistently debated and discussed the potential of the green economy and how it should be protected and used sustainably. Most studies to date on the economic value of natural resources have thus concentrated on the green economy and how countries could harness its resources to achieve growth and development. However, perhaps the blue economy (i.e., ocean resources) could also help achieve growth and development. Studies on the blue economy are concept notes, reports and literature reviews on the evolving definition of the concept. Therefore, we examine the blue economy in the context of marine communities’ socioeconomic characteristics that could lead to changing patterns in the use of ocean resources. Using household survey data (Ghana Living Standard Survey–GLSS 7) and regression analysis, we investigate the socioeconomic lives and welfare of marine communities amidst blue economy principles. We found that most marine households enjoy a reasonably high standard of living, which bodes well for blue economy principles as livelihood diversification could reduce pressure on fishing as the only job in these communities. However, we also found that many rural coastal communities have more appalling socioeconomic living conditions than their urban counterparts, with poor amenities (like toilet facilities and waste disposal). These are potential threats to the achievement of a blue economy. Thus, policy implications are discussed. © 2023 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.},

	abstract = {The marine environment represents an important resource for the promotion of sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, Life Below Water, highlights the need to balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions when using the World's oceans. However, trade-offs arise between the implementation of SDG goals and the well-being of different groups of people. The use of justice mechanisms is critical for achieving social equity outcomes from ocean use. Trade-offs in implementation between SDG14 and other SDGs in the Seychelles are examined through the lens of distributive and procedural justice. Content analysis of grey and policy literature and qualitative data derived from stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions are used to examine trade-offs between expanding marine protection through the Blue Economy initiative and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP), and the livelihoods and well-being of artisanal fishers. MSP limit fishers’ access to marine resources through spatial, temporal, and permanent prohibitions on access to key fishing areas and gear use that negatively impact upon food security, subsistence livelihoods and well-being. These trade-offs reduce capacity to attain other SDG goals linked to alleviating poverty, hunger and good health and well-being. Consultation processes, by not giving adequate voice to fishers concerns and local knowledge, raise issues of procedural fairness. Trade-offs are largely borne by weaker socio-economic groups, leading to a failure to address issues of distributive fairness. Our research shows that the promotion of sustainable futures in the Seychelles remains elusive unless matters in relation to distributive justice are addressed and procedural fairness is provided. How justice mechanisms can be used in pursuit of social equity from ocean use is explained, and avenues for further research outlined. © 2022 The Authors},

Looking forward, we review and critique the policy proposal of Elizabeth Warren's Blue New Deal. While the current state of the Blue New Deal remains uncertain, we indicate that such a policy framework would integrate justice, equity and inclusivity as part of operationalising the Blue Economy. Given the proposal for a Blue New Deal is relatively new, we propose a research agenda to explore how comprehensive policy frameworks may seek to place justice and inclusivity at the centre of the Blue Economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The blue economy has emerged as an influential global concept. It is commonly understood to relate to the development of the ocean in a manner which also addresses concerns about ocean health in the face of increasing demands on ocean resources, marine pollution, and climate change. While the blue economy holds potential to act as an integrating policy framework for the sustainable development of the ocean, to date, there are limited examples of implementation in practice to test the usefulness of the concept. Based on a typology of “good governance” adapted from existing global typologies, we investigated the role of blue economy governance in enabling integration. We used a mixed methods approach to explore the experience of Seychelles, a blue economy early adopter, combining policy and institutional analysis, semistructured interviews with key actors and partners, and country fieldwork. Our analysis shows that from its inception, Seychelles' vision of blue economy was a transformative model of development based on the protection and sustainable use of ocean resources for the benefit of Seychellois, consistent with the SDGs. Thanks to early political leadership and international engagement, the adoption of the blue economy concept was successful in raising awareness of the ocean health and its connection to people and the economy, and in establishing the basis of a national blue economy “architecture,” which helped secure innovative finance for implementation. Transitioning to implementation, several governance challenges emerged, which included maintaining high-level political momentum, stakeholder engagement, and institutional coordination and capacity. While some governance barriers to effective integration may be unique to Seychelles, some are common to SIDS, and others are found in a range of governance settings. Seychelles international visibility has brought high expectations, not always commensurate with local aspirations, capabilities, and jurisdictional responsibilities. Bridging the gap between global expectations and local realities will require support for locally driven institutional reforms, which take account of issues of scale, culture, and capacity.

	abstract = {The role that seaweeds play as primary producers and ecosystems engineers in marine coastal ecosystems is widely acknowledged. Seaweeds, however, are also important drivers in the development of the blue bioeconomy due to their vast diversity of unique chemicals with a broad range of industrial and biotechnological applications. In tropical regions, seaweed production has been focused on a few species only, because of their hydrocolloids used in the food industry. There is a strong need to identify new applications of red seaweed species in other sectors such as aquaculture. Therefore, to diversify the culture of red seaweeds, more tropical species need to be investigated for their chemical composition and potential application in aquaculture, and then, to develop a method for a sustainable cultivation of new seaweed candidates and enhance their economic potential. Based on this context, we analyze the potential value of the red edible seaweed Acanthophora spp., an under-valued seaweed species which is naturally abundant in tropical countries, and Kappaphycus spp., a commercially valuable seaweed commonly used for polysaccharide extraction. The vast chemical diversity of seaweeds (polysaccharides, phytohormones, amino acids, and pigments) has led to research on a wide range of applications in aquaculture, including pathogen control, immunostimulant, antioxidant, bioremediation, feed, UV protectants, increase in seafood shelf life, animal colorant, and growth regulator for microalga culture. This review hopes to stimulate the interest among seaweed researchers to investigate other local seaweed species and seek greater added value of their biomass and chemical compounds and their applications in the aquaculture sector. Additionally, this information will help stakeholders to benefit from these two red seaweeds by contributing to the diversification of the blue bioeconomy in tropical countries.

	abstract = {The coastal regions had a great ecosystem and potential for the sustainability of life. At the same time, growing human and environmental pressures in coastal areas significantly impact coastal systems. Various problems arise in the development and utilisation of the coastal regions. The issues have prompted the importance of studying coastal area management policies. Specifically, legal uncertainty in the management of utilisation has initiated the formulation of the RZWP3K policy. This study uses stakeholder analysis to map the actors involved and their influence on coastal area management policies. This study was conducted using a qualitative method and stakeholder analysis to explore and classify the actors shaping coastal area management policies. The stakeholder analysis method classified constituents into important actors, contextual fixers, users, and audiences using variables of interest and impact. Developing policies for coastal management is hampered by the conflicting agendas of many parties and their multiple goals and worries. This study recommends that the government maintain stakeholders by keeping them informed, actively groomed, monitored and managed, or satisfied. This paper contributes to conceptual stakeholder analysis literature to analyse coastal area management policies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This study explores the tangled relationship between ports, host communities, and cruise companies by examining the contested nature of the pier expansion at Icy Strait Point, Alaska. This study collected data based on a keyword search of existing texts from multiple sources to better understand the impacts of tourism development on the local community and X’una Kaawu. Thematic analysis revealed key findings of power, access and exclusion, and the shifting Indigenous focus and commodification of X’una Kaawu culture. The blue economy is used as a framework to critically examine the pier expansion and provides a unique theoretical approach for examining tourism development at a cruise port. This study provides a practical contribution by identifying challenges for port communities when attempting to balance social and economic opportunities with development as a cruise destination and a theoretical contribution by adding to the literature on Indigenous tourism and cruise port development. Icy Strait Point is a successful Indigenous tourism destination in Alaska, but the implications of further development highlight the difficulties facing the local community and the need to address power imbalances. © 2023 Cognizant, LLC.},

	abstract = {Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is a process increasingly utilized to allocate space for human activities to support sustainable development of marine areas. Maritime cultural heritage (MCH) is often overlooked within the MSP framework since it is not often readily defined within a given space and, therefore, not mapped. However, MCH holds particular value for regional communities, representing their history and legacy. In addition, MCH offers ideal opportunities for the development of local/regional blue economy initiatives (e.g., sustainable tourism). Therefore, the successful development and implementation of MSP processes requires the active engagement of local communities and the consideration of their MCH. In the light of the process developed in Estonia, we assessed how cultural heritage and in particular, its intangible form, can be integrated into MSP. Stakeholder engagement was used to conduct cultural mapping and knowledge co-production which resulted in ‘county portraits’, a unique approach to strengthen the potential of MCH and dependent human activities and to promote its future consideration in MSP process. The findings demonstrate that the EU Directive on MSP offers opportunities for coastal EU Member States to customize their MSP and use innovative solutions for the explicit incorporation of the MCH. Furthermore, inclusion of MCH could be framed as a way to broaden the appeal of MSP and the MSP process to become more inclusive of diverse values and communities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sludge incineration and seawater desalination are two approaches that can be used in the disposal of waste activated sludge (WAS) and for obtaining fresh water. As resource recovery from wastewater treatment and water purification is a topic of particular interest in these times, “water mining” has become a focus of research, with phosphate/P-recovery from WAS incineration ash, and extraction of useful elements from the brine of desalination being important steps in the pursuit of a circular/blue economy. However, P-recovery from ash involves removing metals, which need to be disposed of carefully, as does the brine collected. If cations in the ash and anions in the brine could be combined in order to produce coagulants/flocculants, a new circular model would be established. A preliminary experiment for this purpose has demonstrated that a liquid poly‑aluminum chloride (PAC) could be synthesized from the aluminum ion/Al3+ removed from the ash and the original brine. With this work, we synthesized the liquid PAC by a hydrothermal method, and the results from infrared spectrometer demonstrated that the synthesized PAC was similar to a commercial PAC. Moreover, the synthesized PAC was able to efficiently reduce the effluent turbidity of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), especially when compared with the commercial PAC. It is therefore important that research in this area be continued in order to improve the quality of synthesized coagulants and to produce different coagulants based on cations and anions in ash and brine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Central American and Caribbean (CAC) countries enjoy diverse marine environments. The oceans that enclose these coastlines contribute significantly to their economic growth. Industrial expansion and tourism place pressure on the marine ecosystems causing a decline in ocean health. To evaluate the cause of ocean health changes we investigated the factors influencing CAC ocean health using a health production function. Using Rank-Based Regression and the set of extractive, cultural and human well-being and services goals measuring Ocean Health Index (OHI), data from the World Bank, and the Human Development Index we developed a production function for CAC countries ocean health. Results show that all regional OHI scores, but Tourism and Recreation, the main income earning industry for most of the CAC countries, are less than the global score with four of the goals less than 40. The production function shows that all the goals, but the biodiversity sub-goal species, positively influencing OHI. Two climatic related variables, Nitrous Oxide and Carbon Dioxide negatively influenced OHI. The results are important to policy makers as they decide on the need to make greater effort towards improving sustainable contribution of CAC ocean resources to the blue economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The restrictions taken to slow down the spread of the virus impact socio-economic activities and the environment. A comprehensive review of these COVID-19 impacts on the ocean-human system is lacking. The current study fills this gap by synthesizing the environmental and socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global ocean by conducting a systemic scoping review of 92 published articles. From a geospatial perspective, the studies covered a total of 37 countries, mainly from Asia, Europe, and North America, with a particular focus on the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. From an environmental perspective, both positive and negative effects on global oceans were summarized. Notably, improved coastal water quality and reduced underwater noise were reported. On the other hand, the increasing COVID-19-related medical waste such as personal protective equipment leads to severe pollution, which threatens the marine ecosystem and wildlife. From a socioeconomic perspective, the impacts of the pandemic were negative throughout with marine tourism and the fishery industry being severely disrupted. Coastal communities suffered from loss of income, unemployment, inequalities and health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity for transformation of management and economic practices in order to save our ocean and boost progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14). Future research should include other sectors such as marine biodiversity, marine renewable energy, climate change, and blue economy development of Small Island Developing States.

However, data and information on the interactions among these fisheries and the ecology of billfish in the WIO are not well understood. Using an in-depth analysis of peer-reviewed articles, grey literature, observation studies, and authors’ insider knowledge, we summarize the current state of knowledge on billfish fisheries in 10 countries. To describe historical and current trends, we examined fisheries statistics from governmental and non-governmental agencies, sportfishing clubs’ reports, diaries of sportfishing captains, and the catch and effort databases of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. We highlight two key points. First, billfish fisheries in the Western Indian Ocean are highly diverse, comprising two distinct segments—coastal and oceanic. However, data are poor for most countries with significant gaps in information especially for sport and artisanal fisheries. Second, the evidence assembled showed that billfish species have immense social, cultural, and economic value. Swordfish are targeted by both large-scale and semi-industrial fisheries, while other billfish species, particularly marlin, are highly sought after by sport fisheries in most countries. Our paper provides a comprehensive review of billfish fisheries and available information in the context of the WIO underscoring the need to strengthen data collection and reporting, citizen science, and collaborative sustainable development and management of billfish. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This prompts us to investigate technologies for underwater communication and networking, namely, technologies that enable the collection of data that are vital for 'Blue Economy' applications. Among these technologies, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-extensively used in terrestrial networks- is being considered because of its high spectral efficiency, low inter-symbol interference and fading, and low sensitivity to time synchronization errors. In this paper, we investigate how OFDM physical layers affect protocol design and performance at higher layers of the protocol stack. Particularly, we present a Reservation-based Adaptive MAC (RAMAC) protocol that leverages the capabilities of OFDM physical layers. Using information about channel conditions, RAMAC selects the OFDM frequencies to use on a per-packet basis. We evaluate the performance of RAMAC via DESERT-based simulations on a variety of underwater scenarios with models of real OFDM-enabled underwater acoustic modems. Results show that, especially when outside interference is present (e.g., sonars), RAMAC provides robust data delivery while keeping latency at bay.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This book presents state-of-the-art perspectives on the Blue Economy. It applies important geographical and sustainability transitions perspectives and underscores how Blue Economy dynamics are situated in regional contexts and shaped by the people who live there. The book highlights the Blue Economy concept as a potential driver of regionally sensitive, ecologically embedded, and community-focused sustainability. The scope for Blue Economy to form a core "cog" in our low-carbon future is obvious, from the potential for renewable energy production and coastal resilience building to possibilities for sustainable food production and the delivery of economic opportunities for peripheral communities. However, fundamental questions remain on how to meaningfully deliver these promises, such as how to avoid embedding a model of damaging extractivism, as per the terrestrial economy, and how to deliver on the key social sustainability principles of human well-being, equity, and justice when planning and developing blue economies. As the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development opens, this book provides a timely reminder of the richness, diversity, and potential of coastal and marine spaces. It advances geographical and transdisciplinary understandings of the Blue Economy and sets a baseline for continued scholarly engagement with the Blue Economy from a variety of perspectives. This timely contribution will be of interest to policy makers, academics, industry leaders, decision makers, and stakeholders working in or connected to the Blue Economy Sphere and working in the fields of Economic Geography, Regional Development, Public Policy and Planning, Environmental Studies, and Coastal Zone Management. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, C.

	abstract = {This chapter explores the ethics in the blue economy - understood as marine industries ostensibly operating in sustainable ways. The ethics of the blue economy is highly complex, a result of covering an ever-increasing multitude of overlapping activities, some with long supply chains and many with significant social, economic and ecological impacts, occurring in dynamic environments often hidden from the view of communities and regulators, and by industries expanding rapidly in scale and technology. In unpacking this complexity, this chapters consider the types of (governing) values that the blue economy should aim to achieve, including both humanist and ecocentric values, and with a particular focus on sustainable development and finance. It also explores the types of (governance) values that the blue economy should employ as it pursues these larger values. It further examines how the ideas of institutional integrity and multidimensional legitimacy can help the blue economy garner stakeholder and community support. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of the blue economy in political discourse has gained traction in recent years, however, there remains no standardized definition. The triple bottom line goals of economic development, social equity, and environmental conservation are at the center of the blue economy vision. Yet the ambiguities surrounding the term have resulted in considerable variation in how the blue economy is implemented and what is prioritized. This paper takes a global snapshot of current approaches to national level blue economy governance. In doing so this paper provides the first global assessment of blue economy implementation approaches, through the development of a global blue economy database. Using the best available information from policy documents, media releases and other publicly available online information, we comparatively analyzed each country’s governance strategy to assess the level of blue economy development in coastal states around the world. Throughout this paper we outline the novel methodological approach we took in order to develop a tool for analyzing national level blue economy implementation on the global scale. This approach will allow for ongoing and continued analysis of blue economy operationalization as the concept continues to evolve.

	abstract = {Improper management of fish waste is one of the factors that makes Philippine fisheries unsustainable. A considerable portion of fish waste is produced in wet markets where bulk of fish products are sold. A comparison of existing practices in different municipalities can indicate the best points of intervention and identify existing traditional practices that can be promoted. This study interviewed stakeholders of the fisheries industry and collected information at the market level to determine existing fish waste management systems. From the responses gathered, the average daily production of fish waste in Philippine wet markets was 70.3 + 0.93 kg, with no significant differences across locations (p = 0.2501). Of the fish waste produced, 32.3 + 1.33 kg per wet market were disposed of, 18.9 + 0.81 kg were sold, and 19.1 + 1.15 kg were given away to stakeholders who re-use the fish waste. A significantly greater proportion of fish waste in rural areas were re-used compared to Metro Manila (p = 0.0311). Incentivizing innovations that maximize the use of derived fish waste at the municipal level, and promoting existing traditional practices, can prove effective in contributing to the Philippine circular economy while providing alternative sources of income for the stakeholders of the fisheries industry. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},
