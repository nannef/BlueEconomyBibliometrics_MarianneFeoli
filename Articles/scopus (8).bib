	abstract = {This book is dedicated to present different aspects of reproductive physiology and molecular endocrinology of commercially important as well as potential aquaculture fish species. The existing aquaculture generation is looking for species diversification for efficient utilization of available diverse water resources. The knowledge of reproductive physiology of fish will help in development of breeding strategy for use in commercial aquaculture. Reproductive system is highly coordinated and governed by means of complex network of nervous, endocrine system and environmental factor as well. This book emphasize on different key aspects of reproductive endocrine system such as basic gonadal biology in the events of climate vulnerability, sex determination, sex reversal, stimulatory hormones, inhibitory hormones and receptors, environmental and chemical factor guiding reproduction, puberty, neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction etc. This book further describes how reproduction is not just indispensable for the existence or survival of an individual, but it is important for the survival of species. Chapters also address the concerns of anthropogenic activities on fish and the aquatic environment lead main trouble on physiological and reproductive processes of aquatic animals. This book offers an attractive compilation of highly relevant aspects of current and future of aquaculture, especially in view of the growing awareness of aquaculture, to food scientists working on commercial fish, animal biologists, fish geneticists etc. This book is very timely, and relevant to the sustainable development goals. The contents would be relevant to policy makers, working towards blue revolution and blue economy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

It starts by decribing a general lack of good bathymetry data globally, and notes how this deficiency inhibits sustainable ocean development. Multibeam echosounder technology is presented as an ideal tool for acquiring high-resolution bathymetry, along with ancillary data sets that serve multiple other needs. Innovations to enable faster, safer, more cost-effective, and more sustainable multibeam data acquisition and delivery are explored, including remote operations, autonmous vehicle and robotic technologies, and artificial intelligence and cloud processing. These innovations are also examined in the context of a changing workforce. The article closes with a call for private sector engagement in two global ocean science initiatives that support a wholly mapped ocean: The Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project and the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Presently, economistic perspectives of the ocean, low regard for knowledge pluralism and historical stereotyping of Khoisan peoples, risk their further exclusion from ocean management in South Africa. Drawing on secondary data on Khoisan history and ethnography in South Africa, the article indicates the potential contribution of the Khoisan to South Africa’s Blue Economy, specifically, their contribution to a holistic and integrated environmental ethos. The authors also argue that South Africa is headed in the right direction by being a signatory to key UN conventions on heritage and the rights of indigenous peoples. However, government has yet to realize its commitments to the inclusion of the Khoisan in its ocean management efforts. The discussion has implications beyond South Africa, as it seeks to interrogate the place of First Peoples in global ocean management regimes. © 2021 Indian Ocean Research Group.},

	abstract = {Determination of hydrospatial information across the marine environment has conventionally appeased by vessel-based acoustic surveys. For the first time in history, the unpredictability COVID-19 health crisis has shut down the entire social and economic sectors across the globe. The continuous nationwide lockdown has made it very difficult to mobilize vessels and survey crews for bathymetric mapping. With the emerging remote sensing technology, hydrospatial specialists today have too accustomed to live and work in the new normality. Apparently, hydrography is clearly undergoing dramatic change which an expanded role to serve an increasing number of stakeholders in the blue economy. In order to seek the maximum benefits from the adoption of forth industrial revolution (IR4.0) paradigms, utilization of high-technology sensors and various unmanned autonomous crafts for bathymetric data acquisition to generate actionable data and information to serve the hydrographic communities. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, hydrographic communities have been forced to accelerate the adoption of emerging technologies to mitigate its impact. Indeed, satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) has become a recognized tool for acquisition to generate actionable hydrospatial data that can alleviate future economic upheavals. Stakeholders are able to extract the bathymetric depth information from the remotely sensed imagery in a split second without physical mobilization and on-site survey. In this paper a new proposed methodology using multi-zone ensemble fitting is introduced for bathymetric determination across the coastal region from high resolution satellite images. By segmentizing the training sets to fit into several designated depth zones, this sequential ensemble fitting approach demonstrates better performance if compares to the traditional single regression algorithm. Derived conclusion points out that newly proposed method can enhance the current bathymetric mapping capability and deliver precise and accurate actionable hydrospatial information in facilitating the emerging demands, in the post COVID-19 era. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {The Blue Economy is an emerging framework through which sustainable development is being pursued within the oceans. To date there is limited guidance into how a Blue Economy should be enacted. We propose four initial steps in the development of Blue Economy policies and plans. Firstly, we argue for early deliberation over what is meant by the Blue Economy within the relevant context. Secondly, consideration of the sectors that make up a Blue Economy should be articulated. Thirdly, we argue that Blue Economy plans should aim to be coherent within the existing policy framework. Therefore, an assessment is required of the existing policy settings for the relevant marine and coastal sectors, and the degree to which they are already coherent, or ‘mutually consistent’ with each other. Finally, a contextually sensitive and coherent Blue Economy policy can be designed which plugs policy gaps and adds value to the existing situation. We test the application of these four steps in two different case study areas, a region of Australia and Timor Leste. Despite substantial differences in context, the process identified ways in which Blue Economy policies could add value to existing governance arrangements in both settings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Building on past success, the federal government has a valuable opportunity to encourage economic growth and advance ocean science and coastal protections. The maritime economy has many stars: valuable fisheries, robust boat building, shipping, tourism, recreation, and more. The blue economy seeks to make a mutually supporting constellation out of these stars. The Senate Oceans Caucus is a case study of bipartisanship on ocean policy and domestic policy opportunities moving forward. Despite our divisive political moment-particularly with regard to environmental issues-members of both parties are resolved to grow the blue economy and safeguard our oceans and coasts for generations to come. That bipartisan resolve affords opportunities to pass ambitious, meaningful oceans legislation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The management of marine and coastal regions requires a strategic approach that ensures minimal tension between the desire of regional economic development and the sustainable development of the coastal region. Blue growth was introduced as a catch-all approach to exploring and exploiting marine resources, however, approaches to blue growth varied due to ambiguity in how blue growth has been defined and applied. While the concept of blue growth has been used as a mechanism for the management of marine sectors, no concise universally adopted definition of blue growth exists which has resulted in the mismanagement of marine resources. This research defines blue growth as the sustainable development of marine resources, generating livelihoods, and securing well-being, from innovation in emerging marine sectors. With this definition of blue growth in mind, this research asks what are the influencing factors that nurture blue growth? To answer this question, this research leverages the findings of consultative stakeholder workshops in five coastal regions along the western Atlantic seaboard. The research shows that some of the nurturing factors include geography and absorptive capacity building to develop marine sectors sustainably. This research looks at blue growth development through the triple helix lens, focusing on how collaborative efforts between the stakeholders can be utilized to build absorptive capacities and identify commercial opportunities. Effectively utilizing blue growth strategies by targeting these antecedent factors could ensure a balanced approach to economic development and the sustainable development. Understanding the influencing factors of blue growths provides a pathway to overcoming the blue growth dilemma managing sustainable development and realizing commercial opportunities to ensure the development of a sustainable blue economy.  © 2021 MTS.},

	abstract = {The growing relevance of the seas and the ocean in terms of economic, geopolitical and governance is reflected in the increase and diversification of scientific publications on the subject, as well as in the global agenda. Within the United Nations (UN) scope, the 2030 Agenda (2016-2030), its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the recent Decade of Ocean Science for the Sustainable Development (2021-2030) highlight the international effort in favor of knowledge, preservation, and sustainable exploitation of these resources. However, there is a vast and recent economic literature on the subject, which is confused and often contradictory, negatively affecting the international debate and policymaking. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to dot the I’s and cross the T’s on this literature, which frequently uses a wide nuance of terms as synonyms, such as blue economy, marine economy, maritime economics, ocean economy, economy of the sea, blue growth, coastal economy, and maritime cluster. Thus, it is necessary to explain the differences between these “fifty shades of blue” economy concepts, specifically because of the relevance of the topic in the Decade of Ocean Science, which often seems limited and misunderstood. To this end, the article performs a bibliometric approach based on 1,351 publications from Scopus and WoS databases, covering the 1959-2020 period, followed by a systematic review. We use the Bibliometrix package in RStudio (v. 3.6.3) to investigate metadata and Biblioshiny as a tool for data analysis. Among our main results, stand out: (i) the progress of the discussion over time; (ii) the expansion of the themes and actors involved in this agenda; and (iii) the main issues and trend topics associated with the different concepts. Since 2012, blue economy has been the most used concept due to the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development. Given the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the relevance of the blue economy is an urgent step to promote anti-cyclical economic policies and to address the UN Ocean Decade, particularly in the Global South. © 2021 The authors.},

Every drop of oil that is prevented from polluting the Ocean will make the Blue Economy a truly Green Economy and every life saved from being lost in accidents, in the recycling yards will truly make every Ship-Recycling yard a safer workplace. Alang (Gujarat-India), one of the world’s biggest ship-breaking yards, recycles about 300 of the 1000 ships that are demolished per annum globally and with India ratifying the Hong Kong convention this number is bound to go up manifold soon. The two most important aspects of the Hong Kong convention namely, environmentally friendly and labour safety, are directly related to making a scrap ship completely gas-free before being permitted to enter the recycling yard. Although recycling yards are claiming compliance with this convention, it appears that its implementation is not taking place as desired, thereby defeating the very purpose of this convention. When a product tanker goes for a grade change, the amount of cleaning carried out and efforts made to ensure that cargo tanks are free from the residues of previous cargo, including all kinds of un-broachable oil that may remain in the pumps, pipe-lines or tank bottoms, is humongous. Depending on the size of the tanker, it may take up to a week to completely remove all the traces of residues. Since the commercial interest of the shipowner/charterer is involved, best efforts are made to do the job most professionally, but in the case of a ship that is being scrapped, since the deal has already been done, it is most unlikely that the shipowner would show similar enthusiasm or concern in making the ship gas-free and make it safe for carrying out hot work. Are the people inspecting the ship before permitting its entry into the recycling yard determined to ensure that the ship is absolutely Gas free, before issuing it a Gas Free certificate? Only the number of accidents and the marine pollution incidents will tell the tale. The data was collected through a survey of shipping companies operating tankers and through appropriate authorities at Alang Ship-recycling yard. The extensive experience of the Author and his colleagues in Tanker operations (Over 20 Years) was utilized in the analysis of data. Only the involvement of third-party experts from the field in Tank cleaning and gas freeing operations can pave the way to safe & environmental friendly Tanker recycling. © 2021 21st Annual General Assembly, IAMU AGA 2021 - Proceedings of the International Association of Maritime Universities ,IAMU Conference.

	abstract = {In the past decade there has been increasing interest in emerging markets for wave energy, both as a stepping stone for development and as a way to create new opportunities for offshore markets such as ocean observation or desalination. Developers who were once focused exclusively on grid-scale development have begun to engage with more unique markets. This has led researchers to begin examining means of assessing emerging-market devices. In this paper, we analyze the Technology Performance Level (TPL) Assessment for its potential use in the assessment of emerging market wave energy converters (EM-WECs). We use Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and a question-by-question analysis of the TPL assessment to determine the changes necessary for such an assessment to be applicable in emerging markets. We discuss how the primary differences between the markets could impact the viable development pathways for developers hoping to succeed in multiple markets. We determine that the different stakeholders and stakeholder requirements of some emerging markets compared to gridscale applications should be met with changes to cost-toperformance metrics, prototype testing processes, recovery planning, materials selection, optimization objectives, and public engagement. © European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference 2021.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of the so-called Blue Economy, various conservation finance mechanisms and financial structures are being proposed as a means of simultaneously securing marine biodiversity and profit-making. A novel approach that is being applied within this new conservation finance frontier is the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance. By synthesizing recent literatures in political ecology on the notion of rent and the biopolitics of nature, this article explores how the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance can be seen as a technique that is mobilized for governing ecosystem rents biopolitically. The article urges political ecologists to pay attention to how biopolitics and governance of rents intersect in market-based environmental governance.While surveying the breadth of projects that involves both adaptation and insurance, I pay particular attention to a parametric coral reef insurance that was recently introduced in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. Such a project, this article argues, involves reconceptualizing the coral reef as an infrastructure that provides benefits – ultimately rents – to the local tourist industry and indirectly the state, but this coral infrastructure is itself in need of being protected through insurance as a biopolitical measure that can ensure the future life of the coral reef by rendering calculable uncertain, future climate threats to the reef. By reconceptualizing ecosystems as infrastructure that can be insured, the notion of ecosystem-based adaptation operationalizes otherwise systematic risks posed by climate change and biodiversity loss on a local scale. Finally, I highlight some of the complications that are involved when insurance is used as a biopolitical means of making nature live. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Blue Economy encompasses those sectors and activities related to oceans, seas, and coasts, such as fisheries, energy, aquaculture, natural resources, logistics, safety and security, transport, port activities, tourism, and shipbuilding repairs. Europe represents one of the leading maritime powers in the world. In 2018, the EU Blue economy generated €750 billion in turnover and €218 billion in gross value added and directly employed about 5 million people. Satellite applications bring an added value in creating innovative and sustainable growth path for many industries, as in the maritime domain. In this context, satellite technology provides marine operators with reliable real-time information while ensuring coverage of vast and unreachable areas. In recent years, maritime operators are facing new challenges: from coastal management to navigation assistance, as well as biodiversity protection and disaster response and management. Satellite data provides a plethora of reliable and easy-to-use solutions for aquaculture, fisheries, algal bloom, safety and security, and coastal development, to name a few. Nevertheless, the take-up of satellite-based solutions is far from being achieved. Scepticism persists from the end- users' side due to a series of factors as a lack of clear communication with service providers; a poor understanding of the benefits related to the integration of satellite-based solutions in their workflow; financial constraints; and a lack of knowledge and competencies for implementing and using satellite-based services efficiently. Recently, Eurisy launched the initiative Space4Maritime. The objective is to identify and understand the needs of European maritime end-user communities, facilitating the dialogue with the space industry and the uptake of satellite services. In this frame, Eurisy started a series of interviews with end-users identified in the blue world. The result of these interviews is the core of the paper. The overall objective is to identify the existing operational solutions applicable in the maritime domain through practical examples, as well as the bottlenecks that harness the potential of satellite applications for the sustainable growth of the Blue Economy. The paper will mainly address service providers and public authorities, providing them with a set of recommendations on how to foster cooperation with maritime operators. But it also targets potential new end-users interested in adopting satellite solutions in their workflow. The case studies will be complemented furtherly by additional information collected through desk research and the organization of thematic webinars.

We present two case studies as examples of how seascape ecology and ocean observing can support a new class of fisheries products and services. These products and services can serve the fishing and regulatory sector with various forms of dynamic habitat classification, and through community based codevelopment, the economic benefit of these products can be rapidly delivered in a way that is impactful and informative to all the economies linked to commercial and recreational fishing. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {How should one assess whether traditional ocean industries and new ocean emerging activities have the right incentives to engage into a blue sustainable economy path? The case of Brazil’s Public Expenditure Review (PER) of tax exemption and subsidies applied to ocean related economic activities from 2011 to 2018 opens the debate. The extra-budgetary PER is applied with the Rio Markers from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the economic activities listed by the World Bank´s Blue Economy, Ocean Decade’s results and Sustainable Development Goal 14 targets. The data on tax exemption and subsidies was obtained from official sources, from the Federal Government Budget System maintained by the Ministry of Economy. The screening was carried out for all national level tax relief and subsidies applied during 2011 and 2018. There were 316.4 billion reais (US$ 80.2 billion) spent by Brazil’s Federal government on ocean-related economic activities, either directly or indirectly, through subsidies and tax relief over 2011-2018. The accumulated GDP over that period was equivalent to 45.9 billion reais (US$ 11.6 billion). The sector that most benefitted is Agriculture (includes fishing), which received around 229.1 billion reais (US$ 58.0 billion) in incentives during this period. As for the method, it is necessary to develop and establish standardized ocean related markers in the economy and in PER reviews. © 2021 The authors.},

	abstract = {Poverty and inequality remain a development challenge for most fishery-dependent households. This has prompted the current interest in the ocean-based economic model as Kenya became the first to host a global conference on the sustainable blue economy which was held in Nairobi in November 2018. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges surrounding the blue economy approach, we used a fractional response model to analyze drivers of marine fishery dependence. Our case study, involving 384 randomly selected households from Coastal lowlands of Kenya, specifically Kilifi County, revealed that marine fishery is the highest livelihood option exhibiting gender differences. The livelihood participation rates were approximately 68%, 36%, 31%, 25%, and 9% for marine fishery and related activities, agriculture, self-employment (excluding agriculture and marine fishery), wage employment, and remittances respectively. Many livelihood options were pursued independently implying a low level of diversified livelihood strategies in the region. The analysis of the determinants of the marine fishery dependence indicated that education level, agricultural productive assets, access to credit, group membership, security of tenure, flood shock, and fish price shock significantly influenced marine fishery dependence. The study therefore recommends government intervention in marine governance and development programs such as infrastructural development, capital availability and extension services. This will enable the dependent households to diversify to alternative livelihood options and contributes to sustainable marine fishery dependence. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Much like wind energy in its early years, marine energy has vast potential, and wave energy converter (WEC) concepts are constantly in development. Consequently, wave energy faces many challenges for expansion and has a wide-ranging design space of WEC concepts. The large design space demands new methods for understanding the potential performance of early-design stage concepts. The Technology Performance Level (TPL) metric has been a proposed method for early-stage concept assessment. However, previous research has shown that the TPL is not designed in such a way that it is able to distinguish between multiple early-stage, low-fidelity concepts. We created a conceptual design tool to complement the TPL assessment to help wave energy developers during the design stage, rather than a quantitative assessment metric. The tool guides marine energy developers during the conceptual design of a wave energy converter by presenting designers with established practices, asking if their concept can meet these practices and constraints, and providing design feedback based on the answers. In this paper, we document the architecture, content, and results from our first tests of the tool. While limited in the number of participants, this study serves as a proof of concept of the tool’s ability to impact design decisions during concept generation. These results also provide insight for further improvement of the tool’s structure and content. Creating awareness of oversights early in the design process will help wave energy developers effectively engage stakeholder requirements, increasing the appeal of a wave energy converter concept to marine energy stakeholders. © European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference 2021.},

	abstract = {Introduction: “Blue Economy” refers to ocean-based economies with a sustainable approach. It focuses in smaller carbon footprints and efficiency, principles that can be applied to aquaculture. However, it has been difficult to develop successful blue economy projects in sea urchin aquaculture. Objective: To compare URCHINOMICS (Norway) and ARBACIA (Argentina), two aquaculture projects with different business models. Methods: We used publicly available information to compare both companies on the basis of their value proposition and tensions (e.g. cultural, social economic and technological). Results: To be successful, sea urchin aquaculture requires development of appropriate technology, open innovation and cooperation of people with different academic, business and organizational backgrounds. Conclusion: The ultimate success of these and similar companies will depend on free interaction of experts from multiple fields and on technological innovation. © 2021, Universidad de Costa Rica.

The ongoing negotiation of an internationally binding legal instrument, under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, aiming at conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, may have therefore a catalytic effect on the growing capacity of ocean science. The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, 2021-30, will add global scale and momentum to this positive scenario.

	abstract = {Aquaculture now produces more seafood than wild capture fisheries and this production is expected to at least double by 2050. Representing almost half of global production, marine aquaculture will contribute to sustainably feeding the growing humanity. However, climate change will undoubtedly challenge the future growth of marine aquaculture. Temperature and sea-level rise, shifts in precipitation, freshening from glacier melt, changing ocean productivity, and circulation patterns, increasing occurrence of extreme climatic events, eutrophication, and ocean acidification are all stressors that will influence marine aquaculture. The objective of this themed article set was to bring together contributions on the broad theme of the potential impacts, adaptation, and mitigation strategies of marine aquaculture to climate change. Here we present 14 papers covering a diverse set of approaches including experimentation, modelling, meta-analysis and review, and disciplines like biology, ecology, economics, and engineering. These articles focus on the impacts of climate change-related stressors on the aquaculture potential itself and on the resulting ecological interactions (e.g. parasitism and predation), on phenotypic plasticity and adaptation potential of species, and on measures to mitigate the effects of climate change on aquaculture and vice versa. Considering this, adaptation of the aquaculture sector relies on anticipating the biogeographical changes in the distribution of species, determining their potential for adaptation and selective breeding for resistance or tolerance to climate-induced stressors, and fostering ecosystem resilience by means of conservation, restoration, or remediation. By will or by force, aquaculture will contribute to the low carbon economy of tomorrow. Aquaculture must move towards a new paradigm where the carbon footprint and the analysis of the life cycle of products are at least as important as economic profitability. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.

A questionnaire was designed to capture context-specific community-based blue economy practices. The virtual factors and environmental determinants which affect the sustainability of ecosystem between resource benefitters were evaluated. A significant difference is noticed between male and female beneficiaries for preference to all the variables except enhanced waste management practices variable (insignificant difference- 0.183; Mann-Whitney U test). All the variables significantly advance the livelihood sustainability of ecosystem-dependent population and the ecosystem service evaluation process. The present survey also resulted that the better sustainability of blue economy involved the significant implementation of growth agendas by minimizing the effluent and sewage disposal, developmental activities in industrial areas, disaster outbreak and eliminating harmful fishing practices, overfishing and instead incentivizing approaches that promote growth, improve conservation, build sustainable fisheries, and terminate the IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing. An ecosystem-based management framework, improved governance is required to grow and improve the sustainability of livelihood and ecosystem towards a blue economy. Innovative financing to direct investments into economic activities is also needed to enhance ocean health. A further step would be to assess how such human inputs or improved management practices could be included in the set of ecosystem service indicators. © 2021 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

It addresses the case of projects in the field of “blue economy”, which aims at combining socio-economic development and sustainability in the conduction of human activities related with the ocean. Transformative activities in this field are especially important, given the weight of ocean-related traditional sectors in the economic activity of several European countries. The paper maps the interactions between new and established Portuguese industries, to investigate whether and to extent inter-sectoral relationships are leading to the development of innovative and sustainable solutions, as well as which sectors have a more determinant role. Then it looks for evidence of revitalization and transformation processes being induced by collaboration with firms from new industries.

	abstract = {This paper presents major gaps and challenges for implementing the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) in the Mediterranean region. The authors make recommendations on the scientific knowledge needs and co-design actions identified during two consultations, part of the Decade preparatory-phase, framing them in the Mediterranean Sea’s unique environmental and socio-economic perspectives. According to the ‘Mediterranean State of the Environment and Development Report 2020’ by the United Nations Environment Programme Mediterranean Action Plan and despite notable progress, the Mediterranean region is not on track to achieve and fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030. Key factors are the cumulative effect of multiple human-induced pressures that threaten the ecosystem resources and services in the global change scenario. The basin, identified as a climate change vulnerability hotspot, is exposed to pollution and rising impacts of climate change. This affects mainly the coastal zones, at increasing risk of extreme events and their negative effects of unsustainable management of key economic assets. Transitioning to a sustainable blue economy is the key for the marine environment’s health and the nourishment of future generations. This challenging context, offering the opportunity of enhancing the knowledge to define science-based measures as well as narrowing the gaps between the Northen and Southern shores, calls for a joint (re)action. The paper reviews the state of the art of Mediterranean Sea science knowledge, sets of trends, capacity development needs, specific challenges, and recommendations for each Decade’s societal outcome. In the conclusions, the proposal for a Mediterranean regional programme in the framework of the Ocean Decade is addressed. The core objective relies on integrating and improving the existing ocean-knowledge, Ocean Literacy, and ocean observing capacities building on international cooperation to reach the “Mediterranean Sea that we want”. © 2021 The authors.},

Initially, OHH programs focused primarily on illnesses associated with exposure to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters, such as those caused by harmful algal blooms (HABs) and Vibrio bacteria, as well as a few health benefits including potential new pharmaceuticals. More recently, OHH programs have expanded to encompass health effects from other freshwater bodies and reported health-promoting effects of “blue” spaces (coastal areas, rivers, or landscapes involving water features). Today’s OHH centers follow community participatory approaches to research, and results are incorporated into products and tools to increase understanding of health risks and benefits associated with aquatic environments and to communicate this information in ways that protect and enhance public health. This chapter explores OHH topics including forecasting of HABs and Vibrios, the wicked problem of plastics in the marine environment, aquaculture as a source of sustainable seafood, potential for growth of wellness tourism, environmental justice, and development of a human health observing system. Highlighted throughout the chapter are some of the myriad opportunities for OHH programs to contribute to the new blue economy and vice versa through data streams, information products and services, new and developing technologies, and workforce development. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Utilizing generic frequency domain representations of the Oscilla Power Triton WEC and spectral wave conditions at PacWave (Oregon), Los Angeles (California) and WETS (Hawaii), a series of interesting results emerge. Firstly, the ‘optimal’ WEC size, from an energy standpoint, is fundamentally dependent on the frequency distribution of the incoming wave variance density spectrum. Secondly, and from a seasonality perspective, the seasonal WEC energy generation doesn’t necessarily follow the seasonal distribution of gross wave power. Finally, from an hourly power variability perspective, a reduction in WEC size generally decreases variability. However, for each of the locations investigated, there appears to be a WEC size threshold; a threshold where further reducing WEC size results in increased power variability. © 2022, European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference.

It represents not only an impressive economic area, but it also largely conditions the quality of life of all mankind. However, it is facing unprecedented challenges due to the over-exploitation of resources, the deterioration of the global environment or the need to further secure operations. Space technologies have the potential to substantially contribute to addressing most of these challenges given the unique features of satellites to offer remote sensing, navigation, positioning or advanced communication capacities. This article illustrates such potential with concrete examples of dedicated innovative space applications. However, despite the obvious synergies and interdependence between space and oceans and the many initiatives taken by various institutions, no formal framework has ever been set to ensure coordination of activities at a global level and favor convergence. © Kai-Uwe Schrogl, Christina Giannopapa and Ntorina Antoni 2021.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly evident that a sustainable use of the sea and of technologies and services that support this sustainability are fundamental for the impact they have also on the sustainability of the mainland. The Blue Growth, a knowledge driven exploitation of the marine resources, is a target that EU and many other countries have set to improve the societal wellbeing. In particular the Mediterranean has still unexploited potentials to provide very specific ecosystem services and new technologies in order to contribute to economic growth. To this aim, the European Commission funded the Bluemed project (2016-2020), which involves nine different European countries (Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain) and their relevant stakeholders in the definition of shared strategies at national and international level; the Italian National Research Council (CNR) coordinates Bluemed. Given this framework, the present paper, starts from the main outcomes of Bluemed on research and innovation in the Mediterranean, through a detailed analysis of the most relevant activities and thematic objectives for some of the main marine and maritime socio-economic drivers (transport, tourism, energy have been chosen). Then, on that basis and with the support of a deep literature overview, it tries to understand the present status of some relevant sectors for their potential impact on technology and innovation on this maritime area, highlighting the main obstacles to the fulfilment of the planned priorities and proposing possible strategies to overcome them; all this starting from an Italian perspective. The emphasis is put just on the gaps and barriers to Blue Growth, and on the ways to overcome them, to help the identification of cross-cutting high-level priorities and actions for research and innovation, to be shared at national and Mediterranean level. The main contribution of the work presented here is the recognition that concrete steps towards a “Blue” economy can be achieved only by going beyond the identification of research and innovation challenges and priorities for specific sectors, since they necessarily reflect a partial, sectorial view, and that the main effort must be directed towards an integrated view of how different activities, often conflicting, might coexists. Another finding is the planning of roadmaps to follow so that new technologies/knowledge could overcome those conflicts. As a consequence, the aim and the output of the paper is not proposing a further detailed list of Research and Innovation priorities, but is instead trying to identify how the most relevant R&I challenges for Blue Growth already available can be more efficiently pursued following the roadmaps proposed in the paper.

Profitable outcomes of marine bioprospecting remain meager, and businesses have repeatedly overexploited living marine resources. While varieties of chemicals that could make humans healthier, more youthful, and more beautiful surely abound in the oceans, science has barely begun to look at the 250, 000 known species of marine life to classify them systematically by useful attributes. Meeting demand for consequent products most likely needs to occur through synthesis on land. A bio-based industry likely to boom soon uses loose DNA in seawater, or environmental DNA, to measure the presence and abundance of marine species. Environmental monitors await regulatory approval of genetic data as a complement to, and substitute for, data from nets and other traditional forms of stock assessment. Collectors of biological information will increasingly operate remotely and autonomously, and personnel will shift to bioinformatics roles on shore. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The fishing industry has a prime place in the “Blue Economy” project, but nine of the main fish species in Kuwait have recently declined Rubian (Shrimp), Zobaidi (Silver Pomfret), Suboor (Hilsa Shad), Naqroor (Javelin Grunter), Hamoor (Orange-Spotted Grouper), Hamra (Malabar Blood Snapper), Halwayuh (Black Pomfret), Frush (Trout Sweetlips), and Kasur (Lizard Fish). This paper investigates the nature of pollution in Kuwaiti waters, examining its extent and causes, questioning whether or not it is a primary reason for fish decline, and discussing what measures could be taken to reduce or remove it. The data for this study were gathered from peer-reviewed articles, official Kuwaiti statistics and reports, and semi-structured interviews conducted in Kuwait with stakeholders in the fisheries including staff in the Kuwaiti Scientific Institute, the Fishery Protection Authority, the Environmental Protection Authority and governmental departments; fishers; and fishery business owners. The main finding of this study is that because of the weak government policies and practices to counter pollution, pollution does exist in Kuwaiti waters, but there is no solid evidence that it has a direct link to the decline in fish stocks. Overfishing, especially by illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) vessels, seems to be a more substantial cause of the decline in fish stocks. Copyright © 2021 Alqattan and Gray.},

	abstract = {The oceans have the capability to support the current transitions occurring within our societies, including the implementation of clean energy production and storage technologies and new paths for sustainable food production. These transitions are, nonetheless, many times dependent on innovative technologies which require long paths of technology maturation before they can fit the existing ecosystems and markets. One critical step for technology validation is the demonstration stage in real offshore conditions, which is necessary to validate the performance of the proposed technologies, as well as their reliability and economic viability. In this respect, Portugal has been the testbed of several ocean-based technologies, including the Windfloat device, and possesses the necessary infrastructures to implement and test further innovative concepts and designs. Still, these infrastructures are currently underutilized, which means more technology developers could be testing and implementing their technologies in the country. This paper presents the OceanACT initiative, which is being led by five partners, + ATLANTIC, CEIIA, Fórum Oceano, INESC TEC and WavEC, aiming to promote and manage the existing offshore testing infrastructures in the country. The vision and the strategic path for the initiative, as well as the available infrastructures, and its respective metocean conditions, are presented here. This initiative intends to attract new technology developers to the country, and consequently generate relevant socioeconomic benefits, such as the attraction of investment, the inclusion of the national industry into the supply chain of these innovative projects, and the creation of highly qualified jobs.  © 2021 MTS.},

	abstract = {The article explores opportunities for the sustainable economic development of coastal territories in the Baltic Sea region (BSR) arising in blue economy sectors in the framework of digital transformation. The study argues that more active commercialisation of territorial resources can facilitate the sustainable economic development of the BSR coastal territories, following digitally-driven innovations. The paper provides an overview of methodological approaches to territorial sustainability. It also assesses the 2009—2018 level of the socio-economic development of the BSR coastal territories, underpins the importance of the blue economy and highlights the role of digital transformation in reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the BSR through digitally-driven innovations. A comparative and problem-targeted statistics analyses show significant differences in the dynamics of socio-economic development in the BSR coastal territories with their GRP per capita being generally lower than the national or macroregional average. A review of literature on sustainable development in the BSR has shown that a more active use of the unique resources of coastal territories along with a technology-driven growth of the blue economy sectors can counterbalance the negative impact of the uneven development of these territories on the progress towards the SDGs in the BSR. Increasing the competitiveness of the BSR coastal territories requires investment in digital solutions in the blue economy sectors and building communication infrastructure. The review of key innovations in the blue economy sectors shows that their implementation gives impetus to other industries by reducing costs, creating new jobs, and improving the quality of products and services. © Roos, G., Kubina, N.

Utilizing generic frequency domain representations of the Oscilla Power Triton WEC and spectral wave conditions at PacWave (Oregon), Los Angeles (California) and WETS (Hawaii), a series of interesting results emerge. Firstly, the ‘optimal’ WEC size, from an energy standpoint, is fundamentally dependent on the frequency distribution of the incoming wave variance density spectrum. Secondly, and from a seasonality perspective, the seasonal WEC energy generation doesn’t necessarily follow the seasonal distribution of gross wave power. Finally, from an hourly power variability perspective, a reduction in WEC size generally decreases variability.

	abstract = {Moving water has one of the highest energy densities, yet a major untapped and underutilized area of energy production is wave energy. With the recent interest in the Blue Economy, this is about to change. Point Wave Energy Converter (PWEC) absorbs the wave energy at a single point and is characterized by the buoy surface component and a longer subsurface component that is attached to the seabed. The motion of the top buoy is used to pump fluid or drive a linear generator, which in turn provides power. This paper numerically investigates different shaped surface buoys, with a focus on the power-generating ability of the system, for a single point WEC using a non-linear free surface approximation. Three-dimensional simulations of the buoys in various sea states were modeled in OpenFOAM using Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations with Finite Volume Method (FVM). The dynamic mesh module was integrated with the two-phase solver, and the mechanical system of the WEC was modeled with a forced oscillator mechanism. By studying the displacements, frequency responses, and design parameters, the optimal buoy shape for maximizing energy output was determined. Further, the guidance regarding the effect of changes in the geometry, represented by the length to diameter ratio of the shape, is discussed. The results showed that the spheroid buoy shape with a low length to diameter ratio is a good candidate shape to extract wave energy since it has a large waterplane area. © 2021 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)},

	abstract = {With an Exclusive Economic Zone of 10 million square kilometers, Australia has enormous potential to use its oceans to sustainably increase seafood and renewable energy production. However, to realize this potential, these industries must move offshore into more exposed high-energy operating environments. This move will involve the development of new more robust structures, technologies, and production systems that require less maintenance with increased autonomation, as well as new planning and regulatory frameworks to provide industry confidence to make long-term investments and community confidence that the operations will be environmentally sustainable and socially responsible. This emergence will only be possible through innovations in our knowledge-based digital economy, the “new blue economy.” The Blue Economy Cooperative Research Center (CRC) brings together national and international expertise in aquaculture, marine renewable energy, and maritime engineering, as part of a single, collaborative research center. Through integration of the knowledge and expertise across these sectors, this CRC paves the way for innovative, commercially viable, and sustainable offshore developments and new capabilities that will see significant increases in renewable energy output, seafood production, and jobs that will transform the future of Australia’s traditional blue economy industries. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The migration into deeper water created new challenges, and the industry invests heavily in scientific studies, and research and development, to overcome them. In many cases, oil and gas companies form consortiums that support collaborative research conducted jointly by academic and industry scientists. As the level of engagement with the ocean observing community has grown, the industry has released much of its data into the public domain and supported the development of appropriate degrees and training to ensure that the new blue economy has a capable workforce. As the balance of energy moves away from hydrocarbons to renewable energy sources, and new industries emerge such as deep-sea mining, requiring the services of ocean scientists, the new blue economy created by the oil and gas industry will be well equipped to serve their needs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Fishery resources from marine and inland waters, together with aquaculture, deliver food, nutrition and consider an important income source to upto 820, 000, 000 people worldwide, from collecting, processing, marketing, and dissemination. For numerous coastal communities, it constitutes part of their traditional ethnic identity. Many threats face the sustainability of global fishery resources such as overfishing, pollution, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and recently the climate changes. In Egypt, fish production from natural resources and aquaculture plays a vital role in food security, livelihood, national GDP, poverty alleviation, and employment opportunities in rural areas. Egypt achieves fish production of about 1.9 million tons: 1.6 million tons from aquaculture, and about 0.3 million tons from natural resources. The natural resources in Egypt (marine and inland resources) had severely declined in the last decades; this enhanced the efforts to promote responsible and sustainable fisheries and aquaculture practices and preserve healthy marine environments. This chapter will describe the current status of Egyptian marine fisheries, will address the main challenges facing its development, and will give some practical solutions for its sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The economic importance of aquaculture, coastal and maritime tourism, and industry based on oceanic energy is crucial for explaining that transformation. The European “blue growth” generates employment and economic opportunities but could have major environmental effects on coastal zones. This could become inimical to small-scale fishing and those communities that depend heavily on fishing. This paper studies the Spanish fishers’ perceptions to the linkages between the Blue Growth and small-scale fishing. Results show a significantly positive attitude toward potential contribution of blue growth to socioeconomic development and a significantly negative perception on environmental impact of such activities. Interactions are identified as well as possible opportunities that Blue Growth could offer to small-scale fishing.
