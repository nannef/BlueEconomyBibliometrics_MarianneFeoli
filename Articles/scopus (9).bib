	abstract = {Analyzes of [maritime] security issues have long focused on threats to the nation-state, thereby promulgating traditional state-centric security policies and practices. The preceding claim is valid for maritime security responses on the African continent, where piracy/armed robbery at sea has been met with robust regional and international interventions, and resulted in two UN resolutions and regional policies. Focusing primarily on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, this paper seeks to highlight the centrality of human security issues to national security by providing evidence of the cyclical relationship between the two; anything that undermines human security, explicitly threatens national security. Utilizing evidence from Nigeria, the paper critiques the tendency to ignore the individual as the referent object of security. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

Nevertheless, compared with other European regions, the cooperation and promotion activities of companies that belong to the Blue Economy in South Baltic Sea Region (SBSR) are not sufficient. As a response to this, the EU-project INTERMARE South Baltic aims to support the maritime economy in the SBSR by the creation of a network of companies and stakeholders. In line with the project, this study aims to analyse the future potential of the maritime economy and to identify trends that impact the sustainable development of the blue sector in SBSR. Based on primary data from a SBSR wide survey, descriptive statistical analysis is applied and Compound Annual Growth Rate is used as an indicator.

Also, their environmental knowledge showed to be based on a visual perception, rather than on a cognitive one, as marine litter was considered a great environmental problem, while invasive species and biofouling went unnoticed, remarking the lack of an effective communication from scientific sources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper offers a conceptual contribution to understanding ocean governance and the management of spaces for the protection of marine biodiversity, organization of extractive industries, the arrangement of global shipping and other 'blue-economy' uses. Rather than focus on one type of management technique (such as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) or example of Marine Spatial Planning), or a site-or species-specific case study of governance, this paper offers a theoretical tracking of the uncharted territories of governance that foreground ocean management approaches. The literature on ocean governance and management techniques predominantly derive from scientific disciplines (which provide the basis for planning) and policy-related social science fields, leaving a lacuna in more critical discussions of ways of knowing and understanding the world that drive it. The paper argues the need to critically understand the ontologies (the regimes of what we believe exists) and geophilosophies (the geographically informed modes of thinking) of territory that underscore ocean management to make sense of its past successes and failures, its present functioning and its future directions. This paper argues that without critical consideration of the kinds of thinking-the ontologies and geophilosophies-that drive ocean management, it will lack the transformative potential many hope it will achieve for sustainable development.

Thinking in terms of the blue economy and more sensitive forms of tourism and recreation that consider environmental protection have laid focus on the idea that the coastal environment may be ‘consumed’, yet that this consumption needs to fit with the principles of sustainability. The purpose of this paper is thus to evaluate what sustainable consumption of the coastal environment may (or may not) look like in a locality facing competing social, economic and environmental sustainability pressures, specifically Taitung County in Taiwan. We conduct in-depth interviews with key actors involved in the dispute over the construction of the Miramar Resort in Taitung, and assess these through the conceptual lens of sustainable consumption. Our study finds significant contestation over the developer and local government claims that the resort represents a sustainable trajectory for the locality, with differing views on environmental impact, fairness of process, and distribution of economic benefit. In a wider context, these findings illustrate the importance of inclusive and meaningful decision-making processes, shared end goals, and good support for local-level coastal managers and planners if consumption-driven developments are to form part of sustainable local development in peripheral coastal regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The adoption of sovereign blue bonds by the Republic of Seychelles, hereafter referred to as Seychelles, focuses on resource sustainability and illustrates options for island countries to use their ocean resources for years into the future. The fishing industry is one of the main pillars of Seychelles’ economy and is of crucial importance for domestic food- and employment-security. In order to promote long-term ecological sustainability and economic viability of domestic fisheries, accurate and long-term baseline information is required. Such baseline data were derived here with a reconstruction of the Seychelles’ domestic fisheries catches and fishing effort within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) from 1950 to 2017, coupled with resulting Catch Per Unit Effort data (CPUE). The total reconstructed domestic catch was approximately 1.5 times larger than the baseline as reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on behalf of Seychelles from 1950 to 2017 after adjustment for fully domestic catches within the EEZ. Domestic catches (i.e., excluding the large-scale industrial pelagic catches) increased by over 500% throughout the time period, growing from 1,900 t⋅year−1 in the 1950s to around 11,200 t in 2017. The major targeted taxa were jacks (Carangidae), tuna-like fishes (Scombridae) and snappers (Lutjanidae). Total fishing effort in the form of fishing capacity grew from 21,500 kWdays in 1950 to over 3.4 million kWdays in 2017. The resultant artisanal CPUE displayed a declining trend over time, suggesting a potential decline in relative abundance of fish populations within the Seychelles EEZ or targeted fishing areas. © Copyright © 2020 Christ, White, Hood, Vianna and Zeller.},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to address interactions between the economy, society, and the biosphere. However, indicators used for assessing progress toward the goals do not account for these interactions. To understand the potential implications of this compartmentalized assessment framework, we explore progress evaluations toward SDG 14 (Life below Water) and intersecting social goals presented in submissions to the UN High-Level Political Forum. We show that there is a disconnect between the apparent progress shown by indicators and long-term sustainability; for example, short-term gains in reducing hunger or poverty might be undermined by poor ocean health, particularly in countries dependent on fisheries or developing their blue economy. We suggest an extension to existing indicator assessments to integrate scenarios and social-ecological modeling. This approach would ensure that decision makers are provided with knowledge fundamental to directing actions to attain SDGs while minimizing unintended outcomes due to interactions among goals. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {The Circular Economy (“CE”) is gaining momentum as an approach to addressing sustainability challenges. The CE is framed as a transformative model with economic, environmental and social benefits. Nevertheless, the degree of circularity in the global economy is low and critics highlight that current interpretations fall short in delivering promised results regarding the social dimension of sustainability. Instead economic growth is elevated above more radical socio-environmental transformation. This exploratory paper adopts a human needs approach, using Max-Neef's Human-Scale Development proposal as an analytical lens to explore the contentious social dimension of the CE. The study revisits four seminal texts which are commonly referenced as influencing the CE's conceptual development: The Blue Economy; Cradle to Cradle; Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development; and, The Performance Economy. These texts were analysed to identify satisfiers of human needs. This provides insight into how inclusive earlier visualisations were of encompassing human needs, and how these compare to the current CE direction. We argue that satisfiers of human needs are embedded, to differing extents, in some of the early CE depictions. Nevertheless, the CE concept has selectively developed, neglecting radical, human-centric transformational aspects and instead adheres to a familiar pathway of business-led economic growth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Recent warnings from scientists suggest there is limited time to enact policies to avert wide-ranging ecological and social damage from climate change. In the United States, discussions about comprehensive national policies to avert climate change have begun, with “Green New Deal” proposals and climate plans put forth by members of Congress and presidential candidates. Oceans are largely absent or separate from these nascent policy proposals. Here, we highlight a policy framework to develop terrestrial and ocean-integrated policies that can complement and enhance terrestrial-focused initiatives focused on four specific sectors: 1) energy; 2) transportation; 3) food security; and 4) habitat restoration. Given political friction and constrained budgets, an integrated policy framework offers greater potential to achieve a portfolio of mitigation and adaptation goals in a cost-effective manner, beyond what could be realized with marine or terrestrial policy solutions alone. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are technologies that make a global impact by optimizing manual and time-intensive processes using data analytics and robotics, thus making the task more efficient, effective and less time-consuming. This is represented in the cyber-physical context, in which humans and technologies are allowed to coexist and learn from each other. Design/methodology/approach: The logistics and supply chain sector consists of numerous partners and stakeholders, and despite the limited inclusion of automation and AI within the sector, there are still many manual and repetitive tasks. Findings: Stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain sector are creating awareness and slowly implementing AI and automation within their operations. The majority of shipping and logistics is done through the maritime sector, and this is expected to increase in line with the world’s population. Research limitations/implications: Research was limited to Jamaica and a few other countries in the Caribbean. Broadening the scope to include other regional shipping and logistics industry stakeholders would be helpful. Practical implications: The removal of sometimes mundane and even more complex manual processes in the logistics supply chain will give rise to more efficiencies and possibly increased revenue. Social implications: Creating awareness in the Caribbean of international trends is a challenge. Empowering people to use automation and AI for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change and other disasters is yet to be fully realized. However, those who took part in the study did show a significant inclination toward the use of automation and AI in their every-day lives. Originality/value: The purpose of this paper is to examine statistical data on the understanding of automation and AI within education, the port authority and major operators in the shipping and logistics sector throughout the Caribbean. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As many such initiatives are in the global South, labour’s marginality potentially contributes to the existing precariousness of those who are more often identified as “participants”. This article examines the roles and vulnerabilities of these actors: the carbon counters, species identifiers, GIS mappers, tree planters and others operating in the shadows. We draw on current understandings of labour and precarity to examine the geographical contours of an apparent and emerging “eco-precariat”: a socio-economically diverse group of labourers that address the volatile demands of an ever-expanding environmental service-based economy. We illustrate our analysis drawing on examples from a Blue Carbon project in Kenya, ecosystem services project in the Philippines, and REDD+ scheme in Cambodia. We use these examples to theorise the nature of labour in these frontier economies and put forward a framework for analysing the eco-precariat. We highlight the need to understand the precarity and marginalisation potentially created by this green division of labour in the provision of new ecosystem products and services. This framework contributes to ongoing analyses of labour as a central part of the green economy discourse and to larger discussions in the geographies of labour literature around the future of work in the global South and beyond. © 2020 The Authors.

As this understanding grows, deep-sea resources will begin to be exploited more extensively, embodying the hopes of many for a Blue Economy. Institutions to govern this exploitation are only just finding their strides or even just emerging, but there are many cases already of resource overuse and degradation, including overfishing and the impacts beginning to be wrought by a changing climate. Progress towards the sustainable development of the deep sea requires useful indicators that point to changes in human well-being as the deep sea is exploited, such as measures of inclusive wealth. Accounting prices for the natural capital of the deep sea would be useful indicators, and several examples are explored to illustrate current understanding and research gaps. A future economic research agenda would involve refining estimates of accounting prices for the most important types of deep-sea natural capital, locating these within linked classifications of ecosystem services and natural capital, and the design and implementation of a system of economic and environmental accounts for the deep sea comprising the high seas, which lies beyond the purview of individual states. © Oxford University Press.},

All require awareness, information, and achievable actions to contribute to moving towards healthy oceans, the base of a robust blue economy. Ocean Watch, a program run by Ocean Wise Conservation Association, was created to translate scientific understanding, combined with community and traditional knowledge, to empower local action for improved marine health. Clear improvements have been made in the Átl'k_a7tsem/Txwnéwu7ts/Howe Sound marine environment, which have been captured in an updated report following from the original 2017 publication. Information within the reports illustrates the connection of communities and the marine environment through articles describing seven themes, which are: (1) Species and Habitat; (2) Clean Water; (3) Sense of Place; (4) Coastal Development and Livelihoods; (5) Stewardship and Governance; (6) Oceanography and Climate Change; and (7) Seafood. Articles such as the 2017 article: "Sea Stars: wasting disease taking its toll" gave background, rationale for importance, current status, current actions, and recommended actions to improve the health status (healthy, caution, critical, limited/no data). The health status for 10 of 28 reassessed articles improved largely due to actions taken by local communities, as recommended in the 2017 report. However, more work is needed, especially for areas of marine health that were not improving and to address threats from climate change. Establishing a sustainable socio-ecological relationship with the ocean is necessary if we are to protect and restore the health of all components of the ecosystem. Empowering communities to take action improves ocean health, which is inherently linked to the health of individuals, communities, and economies. © 2020 by the authors.},

Although restoration strategies such as assisted evolution have recently been proposed to enhance the performance of coral reef populations in response to current and future stressors, scalability of these concepts and implementation in habitat or ecosystem-wide management remains a major limitation for logistical and financial reasons. We propose to implement these restoration efforts into an ecotourism approach that embeds land-based coral gardening efforts as architectural landscape elements to enhance and beautify coastal development sites, providing additional value and rationale for ecotourism stakeholders to invest. Our approach extends and complements existing concepts integrating coral reef restoration in ecotourism projects by creating a participatory platform that can be experienced by the public, while effectively integrating numerous restoration techniques, and providing opportunities for long-term restoration and monitoring studies. In this context, we discuss options for pre-selection of corals and systematic, large-scale monitoring of coral genotype performance targeting higher resilience to future stressors. To reduce operating costs during out-planting, we suggest to create coral seeding hubs, clusters of closely transplanted conspecifics, to quickly and efficiently restore/enhance active reproduction. We discuss our land-based coral gardening approach in the context of positive impacts beyond reef restoration. By restoring and strengthening resilience of local populations, we believe this strategy will contribute to a net positive conservation impact, create a culture on restoration and enhance and secure blue economical investments that rely on healthy marine systems. © Copyright © 2020 Schmidt-Roach, Duarte, Hauser and Aranda.},

The management of coastal ecosystem services seeks to analyse the various service characteristics and potentials in relation to human activities in coastal zones which are major contributors to Blue Economies. Shellfish reefs provide many of these ecosystem services, but their efficient use and conservation depend on MSP strategies. Therefore, a conceptual framework was adapted and applied to allow an evidence-based decision making that protects and ensures a sustainable use of shellfish reefs. The Dutch Wadden Sea was selected as a case study that could benefit from the implementation of this theoretical framework. This application included an ecological modelling approach that enabled the exploration of future climate scenarios. Four shellfish-based management strategies were developed: Do nothing, Hold the line, Advance the line and Recolonization. These strategies were applied to the modelled climate scenarios and evaluated by their potential effects to the net flow of Ecosystem Services from shellfish reefs. A multi-criteria analysis identified the benefits that could be derived from actively preserving and maintaining shellfish reefs. Results indicate that the performance of different management choices varies under different scenarios, thus the selection of one or another must be well informed. Knowing the effects of different management strategies on the provision of ecosystem services creates awareness among stakeholders and can help policy makers in their decisions to efficiently manage the Dutch Wadden Sea from a conservation perspective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 1490-1494. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. In 2015, the UN impulsed an ambitious initiative called the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including 17 Goals and 169 Targets, to be accomplished in the 2015-2030 period. At the same time, offshore wind industry has taken the great leap towards the ocean. Such wind farms hold more and more wind turbines (>100), depths increase leaving shallow waters (almost 100 m deep), and the power installed is increasing at a dramatic rate not thought to be possible only one decade ago (currently reaching 400 MW). These facts are ones of the great advances of the XXI century, but so far, it has not been done a deep reflection on the impact of the offshore wind on the aforementioned SDG, and on how the offshore wind is going to accomplish all the challenges happening when trying to reach such SDG. The achievement of some of the SDG and the offshore wind technology progress go, with no doubt, hand in hand. This is the case of Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (Climate action), or Goal 14 (Life below water). But there are also other SDG that deserve a special attention, in order to ensure that offshore wind power technology effectively will contribute to reach them, and will not, on the contrary, act to the detriment of them. This is the case of Goal 7 (Affordable and clean energy), Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth), or Goal 10 (Reducing inequalities). In this paper, the great contribution of the offshore wind technology to achieve the SDG is commented, making special emphasis on the possible weaknesses that could appear, and on how to solve them.

	abstract = {Taiwan government proposes a national level Coastal Blue Economy Growth (CBEG) program to promote ocean-linked industries based on the concept of sustainable development. Sea farming development is considered an important aspect that needs to be promoted for the CBEG program. Generally, sea farming relies on artificial technologies, environmental improvement and resource management to increase fishery resources and to enhance fisheries productivity. Developing sea farming could contribute to the transformation of capture fisheries; it integrates the concept of Blue Economy into sustainable economic development so as to improve economic activities in fishing communities. In line with this, the Taiwan government launched the Community-Based Sea Farming (CBSF) project in 2015. The CBSF project aims to establish sea farming zones to help fishing communities achieve sustainable development. In this paper, the development process of sea farming and site selection of the CBSF project were described and the needs of local people in fishing communities around sea-farming demonstration zones were also assessed. According to findings, a framework for sea farming development is proposed. In this framework, several new sea farming-based industries can serve as the driving force to accelerate the development of fishing communities. The driving forces include developing a community-based tourism recreational industry, strengthening localized marketing of featured seafood products, combining local ecological landscapes and cultures of the fishing village to develop recreational fishery activities, and integrating seafood products with recreational tourism activities. Overall, CBSF are important tasks that warrant continuous attention for enhancing the fishing community development. The experiences and framework of promoting the Taiwan CBSF project would provide beneficial information and foundation for decision makers and natural resources managers in other areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We assess policy coherence by examining whether governance objectives are shared within and across existing sector-based policies, and the extent to which they are consistent with Blue Economy objectives. We explore policy coordination through network analysis of the connections between instruments as well as people. A number of gaps in the Timor Leste policy landscape are apparent, with weak governance around social objectives, particularly in the ports sector. In general, however, the existing governing system appears to be largely consistent with Blue Economy aspirations. In addition, there are existing, highly influential policy documents and organizations that are already playing a critical bridging role between sectors. Strengthening connections between sectoral management arrangements, through boundary organizations and amendments to existing instruments, may therefore be an efficient and pragmatic approach to Blue Economy implementation. This approach would allow more focused attention on plugging policy gaps and addressing deficiencies in the existing system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper lies in answering the question of why cooperatives need to focus the attention on the training of their members and workers in environmental aspects. As the main hypothesis, we consider that there are three reasons that lead to the concern of cooperatives about the environment and, therefore, to the need of training in this issue, in coherence with the fifth cooperative principle. In this sense, firstly, we will address the impact that the exposure to certain means or environments can cause on the cooperative members and workers. It entails the need to study the ways in which the prevention is organized and managed in front of environmental risks in cooperatives, as well as to see the peculiarities of cooperatives in this regard. Secondly, we will study the impact of the cooperative work in the environment. Therefore, we will address the way in which that impact can be managed in cooperatives before the mandate derived from the seventh cooperative principle. Finally, we will delve into the importance of considering environment for the purpose of looking for new markets in the green and blue economy. From a methodological perspective, we will follow, on the one hand, the descriptive and comparative methods in order to analyse the applicable rules applicable in the subject, and, on the other hand, the proactive method in order to give an answer to the issues that are not contemplated in regulations. © 2020 University of Deusto.

	abstract = {The concept of Blue Economy (BE) is recognized as central for sustainable development that incorporates socio-economic benefits and ecological conservation. However, in Africa, much of the emphasis on BE is placed on economic gains; as a result, traditional livelihoods and small-scale local operations are outcompeted by international corporations and government initiatives, with little or no regard for social inclusion and environmental sustainability. We argue that successful BE initiatives in Africa accentuate the involvement of local communities and promote sustenance of the natural ecosystem. We define success in terms of the sustainability balance among ecological, social and economic aspects. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, observational data and literature review of case studies across the African continent, we highlight two critical findings. First, large scale BE initiatives prioritize economic gains at the expense of environmental degradation and the exclusion of local communities. Second, using the full spectrum sustainability (FSS) evaluation, we show that successful BE interventions considered ecological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional objectives. Drawing on these case studies, we propose the adoption of a collaborative framework which amalgamates the top-down and bottom-up approaches to BE management. Achieving the goal of successful blue growth in Africa is now even more challenged by the implications of COVID-19 on the BE sectors. Reimagining and rebuilding a resilient BE in Africa post-coronavirus will require a strong political commitment to promoting a balance between economic, social and environmental benefits in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. © 2020 Okafor-Yarwood, Kadagi, Miranda, Uku, Elegbede and Adewumi.},

Marine macroalgae are potentially sustainable feedstock for future food, materials, chemicals, and fuels. For seaweed biorefinery, the fractionation of the biomass to co-produce multiple products is crucial in the efficient valorization of the marine biomass. In this work, we developed a protocol for co-production of six different products from the green macroalga Ulva ohnoi using green extraction methods. A total of 90.31 ± 1.94% of the initial biomass was recovered in separated products. The fraction of the recovered products from initial dry weight biomass was 45.42 ± 1.91% salts, 3.67 ± 1.38% starch, 3.81 ± 1.26% lipids, 13.88 ± 0.40% ulvan, 14.83 ± 1.06% proteins, and 8.70 ± 1.87% cellulose. A potential revenue analyses, based on these experimental data and current market prices, suggests that total the revenue fluctuates between US$1.56 and US$3.93 kg−1 of dry biomass and depends on recovered products fraction in the seaweed biomass and products market value. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals express a narrative about the relationships between people and nature. This paper builds a narrative from an ocean perspective – through the lens of a coral reef seascape, and the blue economy. The ocean, intimately connected with the land, freshwater flows and climate provides a vast array of benefits to humanity. These benefits are valued at trillions of dollars per year globally, supporting hundreds of millions of jobs, and contributing to all countries both coastal and inland, through living and non-living resources, transport infrastructure and natural products, and sustainable energy solutions; the coastal zone is home to half the world's population. Through these direct benefits, the ocean contributes to reduced hunger and poverty, improved health, and all these benefits may be shared across gender, social and national boundaries. However accessing ocean benefits results in pressures that may drive decline in ocean health. Managing this complex system for a sustainable blue economy requires developing and using the right knowledge, new governance mechanisms and investment by stakeholders from global to local levels. This ‘blue economy’ narrative builds on the links between ocean health (SDG14) and economy (SDG8), but the general model can be expressed from the perspective of any goal(s) towards the others. The model also applies across scales from local to global, the relationships defined in the model enabling monitoring and assessment. The model can thus help align global instruments such as the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework with Agenda 2030, and linking from national to grassroots levels. © 2020},

The distorted advancement of technology was by far too steep in comparison to the pace of renewable resources recovery. Today, it is known that sustainability is fundamental in order to preserve sea resources and ensure their high resilience. Certain sectors are highly demanding in terms of human capital, and the tourism industry seems to be on the rise. Worldwide tourism keeps growing, and several phenomena have determined some trends, particularly related to recreational and cultural activities. Tourism inflicts a high pressure on coastal resources at different levels. Natural and social scientists strive to find solutions for the problem, whereas some other sectors of society try to reach solutions in terms of business opportunities. The tourism industry has a large stake in these issues because it is an important opportunity to take advantage of human capital and simultaneously educate people for more sustainable uses of sea resources. © 2021, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {Carbon storage is one of the most important ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. Laminarialean kelps are widely harvested along the Warm Temperate South-eastern Pacific coast, a marine province shared by Chile and Peru. Carbon storage assessments of kelps in Peru are lacking. From a blue economy and sustainable management perspectives, information on the carbon storage of kelps is important. We conduct the first carbon storage assessment of Lessonia trabeculata in Peru and contribute to the development of biomass estimation models in order to monitor kelps using the least destructive methodologies. We chose three commonly harvested sites in San Juan de Marcona to haphazardly extract Lessonia trabeculata sporophytes using transects. Sporophyte height (m), wet biomass (kg), maximum (D) and minimum (d) holdfast disk widths (cm) were measured in the field. In the laboratory, C content was measured to calculate the best-fitting coefficients for future estimations by using allometric equations. Individual biomass was best estimated from sporophyte height through a rational model, while holdfast area (ellipse in cm2) was a good proxy of biomass with a sinusoidal model. The southernmost, least accessible, and most exposed site (Elefante) had significantly higher values of stored carbon. We estimated a carbon standing stock (from sporophytes only) of 2044 t C in these kelp beds. Nevertheless, additional and more detailed measurements will likely produce more accurate estimates both in time and space. We provide allometric equations for future carbon assessments. Our results highlight the importance carbon assessment for kelp management and blue carbon estimates and the need to develop science-based marine planning strategies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Blue economy initiatives have emerged along marine and coastal areas, seeking to bring the green economy into a ‘blue world’. Often defined as a global policy agenda, blue economy discourses and practices aim to generate ‘blue growth’ by linking poverty reduction, social equality, and marine conservation. While global and national policies have spent decades addressing coastal resource management, broader blue economy discourses and practices seem, on the surface, to promote economic growth strategies for marine conservation. Increasingly, new market-oriented programs and projects aim to tap the financial value of the ocean’s ‘blue capital’, ostensibly fostering income generation and sustainable solutions for conservation finance. Drawing on critical discourse analysis and key-informant interviews across scales, we examine the meanings and practices of the blue economy in Southeast Asia and in the Philippines. As an archipelagic nation, millions of coastal dwellers in the Philippines depend on oceans as a major source of livelihood, food security, and well-being. We examine how multilateral institutions, bilateral organisations, state agencies, civil society organisations, and other key actors represent and enact the blue economy discursively and in practice. We find that oceans are being imagined as an open frontier that must be managed and utilised for both conservation and economic purposes. New territorialisation processes are creating new borders and management structures that often bypass social and environmental safeguards, posing a major threat to coastal dwellers. We conclude that by foregrounding economic development and coastal management, more socially just and environmentally sustainable governance approaches are neglected. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {As countries transition to a blue economy to increase the long-term benefits of the sustainable use of marine resources, the different pathways toward the blue growth engine depend on identifying profitable ocean-related sectors and activities that offer advantages when competing with other countries. The ability to identify and establish the processes of blue product exports can be viewed as an essential part of a long-term strategy aimed at supporting blue growth and sustainable development. This paper proposes a method for defining a blue product space based on the product space model introduced by Hidalgo et al. in 2007, which is used to draw and analyze export strengths and the evolution of different countries with respect to a list of blue products. Although this descriptive analysis addresses only a small part of the overall concept of blue economy/growth, the method can identify blue products that may be competitive or potentially competitive in the world market by analyzing product export performance. An example from China is used to clarify the method of drawing the blue product space and analyzing its evolution, which is followed by a discussion of the method's limitations and possible contributions to policymakers and stakeholders when formulating blue industry policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The enhanced vulnerability of insular regions to climate change has been recently recognized by the European Union, which highlights the importance of undertaking adaptation and mitigation strategies according to the specific singularities of the islands. In general, islands are highly dependent on energy imports which, in turn, feature a marked seasonal demand. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in these regions can therefore fulfill a twofold objective: (i) to increase the renewable energy share for global decarbonization and (ii) to reduce the external energy dependence for isolated (or interconnected) systems in which this can only be achieved with an increase of the renewable energy share. However, the increase in renewable technologies makes energy generation more dependent on future climate and its variability. The main aim of this study is to analyze future projections of wind and photovoltaic potential, as well as energy productivity droughts, on the main Euro-Mediterranean islands. Due to the limitations in land surface available in the islands for the installation of renewable energy capacity, the analysis is extended to offshore wind and photovoltaic energy, which may have an important role in the future increases of renewable energy share. To that end, we use climate variables from a series of simulations derived from Euro-CORDEX (Coordinated Downscaling Experiment) simulations for the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. A special effort is performed to normalize projected changes and the associated uncertainties. The obtained normalized changes make it easier the intercomparison between the results obtained in the different islands and constitute condensed and valuable information that aims to facilitate climate-related policy decision making for decarbonization and Blue Growth in the islands. © 2020 by the authors.

The blue economy has become synonymous with generating wealth from ocean-related activities while protecting and supporting marine ecosystems. For remote coastal communities and Small Island Developing States, local economic development is a challenging balance between protecting marine biodiversity and maintaining sustainable and direct access to ecosystem services. In this paper, we present results of a study in the coastal region of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia in the Coral Triangle. The paper illustrates that community-based ecotourism supports sustainable use of marine resources and offers an entry point for low-resource coastal communities to take part in the blue economy. Complementary livelihood pathways that enhance primary income and support ecosystem services play a key role. Study findings show that three key areas where multilateral support is most needed for communities with ecotourism aspirations are: waste management, hospitality skills, and market access. From these findings, we present a model for community-based ecotourism in the blue economy. The model demonstrates important interactions between community, the local economy, and coastal ecosystems, and the important role community-based ecotourism plays in creating effective mechanisms for preserving natural and cultural heritage. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Unprecedented demand for both land and ocean space within the coastal zone to support tourism has continued to negatively impact the coastal marine environment leading to degradation. Poorly planned and regulated tourism activities on land and sea have led to degradation of environmentally sensitive marine areas, encroachment on public beaches, erosion of the shoreline and blockage of public access points to the beaches. These impacts transcend the land and ocean continuum necessitating the need for regulation. Spatial planning is one of the key tools that provides a pre-emptive strategic framework for regulating tourism uses so as to prevent harmful development and mitigate the impact of potentially polluting activities. However, spatial planning as applied in Kenya has focused on the regulation of physical developments on land such as the construction of hotels but not on the related tourism activities that emanate from such developments. In this case, activities that tourists engage in outside of the physical hotel structure such as swimming, leisure walks, sport fishing, souvenir collection, and snorkeling are not the subject of spatial planning leading to unsustainable use within the coastal zone. This study makes a case for adopting an integrated spatial planning approach as a lever for regulating tourism activities within this expanded lens, beyond just the buildings and activities that take place within the hotel establishments. The spatial planning approach would include a holistic regulation of coastal tourism activities within both terrestrial and marine spaces in order to attain sustainable management of the marine ecosystem. © 2020–Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association.},

Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data from 1995 to 2018 have been used for the analysis of eight countries. The contributing factors that measure the fishing production are total aquaculture production, total fisheries production and agriculture, forestry and fishing. Trade and the rate of inflation are used as control variables. Using the feasible generalized least square technique. Findings: It was found that the blue economy factors play a statistically significant role in the economic growth of SAARC countries and contribute to the achievement of Goal 14 of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals: to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Originality/value: This study highlights the fact that proper management and utilization of water resources may assist the stimulation of economic growth and meet the challenges of food insecurity by improving the supply of seafood in developing South Asian countries. The study proposes that the sustainable management of water resources requires an alliance across nation states. The alliance will be useful in understanding the concept of the blue economy and the role it plays in ensuring economic growth in developing nations throughout the world. © 2020, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.},

	abstract = {Claims for ocean space are growing while marine ecosystems suffer from centuries of insufficient care. Human pressures from runoff, atmospheric emissions, marine pollution, fishing, shipping, military operations and other activities wear on habitats and populations. Ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP) has emerged worldwide as a strategic instrument for handling conflicting spatial claims among competing sectors and the environment. The twofold objective of both boosting the blue economy and protecting the environment is challenging in practice and marine planners need decision support. Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) was originally developed to provide an overview of the human imprint on the world's ocean ecosystems. We have now added a scenario component to the CIA model and used it within Swedish ecosystem-based MSP. This has allowed us to project environmental impacts for different planning alternatives throughout the planning process, strengthening the integration of environmental considerations into strategic decision-making. Every MSP decision may entail a local shift of environmental impact, causing positive or negative consequences for ecosystem components. The results from Swedish MSP in the North Sea and Baltic Sea illustrate that MSP certainly has the potential to lower net cumulative environmental impact, both locally and across sea basins, as long as environmental values are rated high and prevailing pressures derive from activities that are part of MSP. By synthesizing innumerous data into comprehensible decision support that informs marine planners of the likely environmental consequences of different options, CIA enables ecosystem-based MSP in practice. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Planning and management require expectations of future system behavior. These expectations can come in the form of predictions, projections, scenarios, narratives, visions and intuitions, at different spatial and temporal scales. While each can provide different insights into a system future, it is not clear how they can be effectively combined into a unified analysis. Here, we propose a general framework to combine conceptual models, numerical projections and scenario narratives, leading to a system view of the functioning of the future Blue Economy sectors as applied to Australian oceans. We start by developing a conceptual model of the sectors directly or indirectly interacting with the Australian oceans and their national and global drivers. We then identify scenarios and projections for each global driver as well as projections of future development for the national drivers and for the Blue Economy sectors. Comparisons of the global scenarios, national projections and sectoral projections suggest that the Australian marine sectors expect to follow a path of growth mostly driven by market forces enabled by government regulations. The analysis of each sector provides information on the extent to which the initial conceptual model can be improved as part of more detailed analysis at a sectoral level. This approach supports sector-based marine planning with a consistent and repeatable framing and can help researchers, managers and stakeholders reach a shared understanding of system interactions and the potential impact of future shocks to national and international drivers. © Copyright © 2020 Boschetti, Bulman, Hobday, Fulton, Contardo, Lozano-Montes, Robinson, Smith, Strzelecki and Ingrid van Putten.},

	abstract = {The rapidly evolving ocean economy, driven by human needs for food, energy, transportation and recreation, has led to unprecedented pressures on the ocean that are further amplified by climate change, loss of biodiversity and pollution. The need for better governance of human activities in the ocean space has been widely recognized for years, and is now also incorporated in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Even so, many challenges relating to the implementation of existing governance frameworks exist. Here, we argue that integrated ocean management (IOM) should be the key overarching approach—building upon and connecting existing sectoral governance efforts—for achieving a sustainable ocean economy. IOM is a holistic, ecosystem-based and knowledge-based approach that aims to ensure the sustainability and resilience of marine ecosystems while integrating and balancing different ocean uses to optimize the overall ocean economy. We discuss examples of IOM in practice from areas where preconditions differ substantially, and identify six universal opportunities for action that can help achieve a sustainable ocean economy. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.},

Many countries have adjusted their own strategic development steps by raising emerging industries that are based on significant technical breakthroughs and development demand.

Energy Saving and Environmental Protection (ESEP) industries have been chosen for the nature of their intensive knowledge and technology, their low consumption of material resources, their large growth potential, and the good overall benefit. China's listed ESEP enterprises, as an example, set performance evaluation indicators based on the path of their corporate value formation and use multiattribute evaluation methods to obtain stable evaluation results. They also comprehensively evaluate marine ESEP safeguard measures to protect the marine environment, to contribute toward transforming traditional development methods, and to accelerate the high-quality development of the marine economy. © 2020 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.},

The Port Authority of Motril from the Minister of Public Works of Spain (where 85% of imports and 60% of exports pass through the ports) has the mission to manage the public harbour land to which its pertains efficiently, cost effectively and sustainably, and to give services to society related to port traffic and the vision to transform the Port into a logistic reference point in Spain, promoting the economic growth of its area of influence and the competitiveness of its Port Community on a road of sustainable development. In this Blue Economy strategy four areas have been consider: Connections, Innovation, Sustainability and Motril itself and its Surroundings. As a well-connected port by motorway, also connected with industrial and logistic processes, the information and the communications to provide an efficient system is the key to integrate all the users, the main players and improving their Ro-Pax lines connected with Africa (Nador, Al hoceima, Tanger Med and Melilla). This innovative harbour promotes the development of more efficient technologies offering improved services to its users and encourages an open innovation, by integrating private sector with research institutions, technological centres and universities. The protection and the conservation of the maritime and coastal environment through actions and projects are recovering old industrial areas, using clean energy and implementing environmentally-friendly processes where the infrastructures looking after the environment. This reality involves designing training programs in the Port Community, to satisfy the needs of the current market, integrate traditional sectors into the new concept of Blue Economy, improving the interaction between all agents related to the sea and investing in social innovation.

Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 835 - 839. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Improving marine resource management and governance requires marrying science and socio-economics, which is key to the development of the Blue Economy. For sustainable growth of the Blue Economy (Blue Growth) to occur, there needs to be robust scientific information on the marine environment, detailed knowledge of activities occurring within ocean space, and comprehensive understanding of environmental impacts. To ensure Blue Growth is sustainable into the future, information is also needed on how the marine environment, activities and impacts may change with time, and at relevant spatial scales. ATLAS, a transAtlantic assessment and deep-water ecosystem-based EU H2020 Project, has undertaken pioneering research to understand the environmental status of the North Atlantic deep sea, and the interaction between Blue Growth scenarios and the marine environment. ATLAS research into North Atlantic Ocean circulation, species and habitat connectivity shows that the North Atlantic is changing, which will impact Blue Growth. As marine industries move progressively offshore, ATLAS work on defining elements of Good Environmental Status for deep-water ecosystems will improve the understanding of Blue Growth interactions with the deep-sea. Potential trade-offs to maintain ecosystem services at a sea-basin scale have also been explored through a selection of 12 ATLAS case studies. ATLAS interactions with industry have highlighted opportunities and challenges for Blue Economy sectors, particularly in the context of marine spatial planning. Through interviews, questionnaires and workshops, ATLAS has discussed key scientific findings and Blue Growth scenarios with 10 major Blue Economy sectors and many supporting sectors. This work illustrates the complexities of Blue Growth in the North Atlantic, including spatial needs, synergies and conflicts, and data sharing opportunities. ATLAS-industry dialogue also highlights differences in Blue Economy sectoral expectations, and levels of understanding relating to new policy instruments. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.},

	abstract = {Kuwait is a country with an emerging economy that could benefit hugely from investment in its marine fisheries production. However, the country is constrained by several problems which affect the health of its coastal fish stocks. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is the most serious of these problems because it reduces fish stock levels. In this study, we analyze IUU fishing in Kuwaiti waters, and assess its impact on fish stock levels and consequent damage to the marine economy and environment, as well as its implications for the security system and the integrity of governance in the country. The research methods used in this study include key informant interviews, information obtained from some illegal fishers themselves, documentary data collected from Kuwaiti public authorities, and peer-reviewed literature. The main finding of the study is that IUU fishing in Kuwaiti waters not only threatens the health of the country's marine fish biomass but raises questions about Kuwait's immigration policy, the effectiveness of its border controls, and the way its decision-making processes are manipulated by groups who influence decision-making and large private companies which break fishing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The small-scale fisheries sector plays a crucial role in the livelihoods, food security and nutritional needs of a large population in Sri Lanka. In the overall fisheries sector, the contribution of coastal fisheries, which is primarily generated by small-scale fishers (SSFs), has been continuously high. However, in recent years, it has started to decline. Changes occurring at local, national and global scales in the economic, political and policy spheres have impacted Sri Lankan SSFs differently, increasing their vulnerabilities. Drawing on a comprehensive review of the literature, this study examines the multiple vulnerabilities faced by SSFs in Sri Lanka, relating to four major themes: (1) Palk Bay geopolitics; (2) the war; (3) the tsunami and post-tsunami recovery; (4) post-war development and policy priorities. This paper builds a case for understanding these vulnerabilities and the way in which they continue, reemerge and threaten SSFs and their future livelihoods. It argues that, in the wake of new threats and opportunities created by post-war development, policy changes and geopolitical constraints, greater attention must be paid to SSFs. The paper concludes by summarising the discussion and recommending that SSFs should be meaningfully incorporated into the postwar development agenda and “blue economy” policy reforms. © 2020 National Science Foundation.

	abstract = {The threat of criminal activity in the fisheries sector has concerned the international community for a number of years. In more recent times, the presence of organized crime in fisheries has come to the fore. In 2008, the United Nations General Assembly asked all states to contribute to increasing our understanding the connection between illegal fishing and transnational organized crime at sea. Policy-makers, researchers and members of civil society are increasing their knowledge of the dynamics and destructiveness of the blue shadow economy and the role of organized crime within this economy. Anecdotal, scientific and example-based evidence of the various manifestations of organized crime in fisheries, its widespread adverse impacts on economies, societies and the environment globally and its potential security consequences is now publicly available. Here we present the current state of knowledge on organized crime in the fisheries sector. We show how the many facets of organized crime in this sector, including fraud, drug trafficking and forced labour, hinder progress towards the development of a sustainable ocean economy. With reference to worldwide promising practices, we highlight practical opportunities for action to address the problem. We emphasize the need for a shared understanding of the challenge and for the implementation of intelligence-led, skills-based cooperative law enforcement action at a global level and a community-based approach for targeting organized crime in the supply chain of organized criminal networks at a local level, facilitated by legislative frameworks and increased transparency. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.},

These conceptions were grounded in observations from the surface or shoreline, and in periods when human activities in the ocean were more technologically and spatially limited than they are today. Advancements in science and technology have significantly altered how humans interact with and access the ocean, allowing exploration and exploitation of ocean areas and processes that were previously incomprehensible. This new capacity to understand and extract from the ocean might be expected to profoundly alter human relationships to it and conceptions of it. As public support and engagement with marine conservation and ‘blue economies’ stem from value and belief systems, future marine management will benefit from recognizing our historical marine relationships as context for changes in understanding, use, and the increasing environmental degradation faced by the ocean. This review focuses on perspectives of the ocean that have been held historically and queries their future persistence at this potential turning point in our relationship with the ocean. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

As demand for resources continues to grow and land-based sources decline, expectations for the ocean as an engine of human development are increasing.

The White Sea coastal municipal areas enter different subjects of the North-West Federal District of Russia and belong to the Russian Arctic zone. The subject of the study is socio-economic processes taking place in the White Sea coastal municipalities. The aim of this work is to identify trends in socio-ecological and economic development of the White Sea coastal municipal areas in the context of blue growth and to elaborate recommendations for the formation an inclusive management system for their development. The statistical data published by the Federal State Statistic Service (Rosstat) and reflecting the development of municipalities in the three interrelated areas of sustainable development are analyzed. The destructive tendencies occurring in the social, economic and environmental sphere of coastal territories are reveled and described: Depopulation, decrease in economic activity, and environmental load. Models are developed that reflect migration processes taking place in coastal municipal formations within the period 1989—2017. The economic development of coastal municipal formations is associated with the availability and accessibility of natural resources. In some municipal districts, the main types of economic activity are those related to the livelihoods of the population. There is a decrease in quality of economic space due to a reduction in the number of working-age people. The digital space of coastal settlements is forming slowly. Against the background of destructive processes in economic sphere, the eco-intensity of emissions decreases. The authors propose recommendations on shaping of a regular institutional environment and overcoming depopulation processes, and suggest directions for the economy diversification of coastal territories. The authors consider it necessary to strengthen inter-municipal cooperation and coordination of management decisions for achieving sustainable development goals in the White Sea region. The realization of the long-term potential of the blue economy in the sphere of employment, economic activity and environmental responsibility is possible if socio-ecological and economic aspects of managing the White Sea region are coordinated and the authorities at all government levels work systematically along the direction. © Kurilo A.

	abstract = {“Blue Growth” and “Blue Economy” is defined by the World Bank as: “the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem”. Multi-purpose platforms (MPPs) can be defined as offshore platforms serving the needs of multiple offshore industries (energy and aquaculture), aim at exploiting the synergies and managing the tensions arising when closely co-locating systems from these industries. Despite a number of previous projects aimed at assessing, from a multidisciplinary point of view, the feasibility of multipurpose platforms, it is here shown that the state-of-the-art has focused mainly on single-purpose devices, and adopting a single discipline (either economic, or social, or technological, or environmental) approach. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to provide a multidisciplinary state of the art review on, whenever possible, multi-purpose platforms, complementing it with single-purpose and/or single discipline literature reviews when not possible. Synoptic tables are provided, giving an overview of the multi-purpose platform concepts investigated, the numerical approaches adopted, and a comprehensive snapshot classifying the references discussed by industry (offshore renewables, aquaculture, both) and by aspect (technological, environmental, socio-economic). The majority of the multi-purpose platform concepts proposed are integrating only multiple offshore renewable energy devices (e.g. hybrid wind-wave), with only few integrating also aquaculture systems. MPPs have significant potential in economizing CAPEX and operational costs for the offshore energy and aquaculture industry by means of concerted spatial planning and sharing of infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Maritime spatial planning (MSP) is a governance approach that has been applauded for its promise to reconcile human uses and conservation, and is now widely implemented in member states of the European Union (EU), as well as in other countries in the Global North, like Canada, the United States and Australia. Five years ago, very few countries in the Global South seemed to be engaged in MSP. The Atlantic Ocean assumes the status of a major ecosystem and has geopolitical importance in the context of EU and is even more strengthened by the long-term political cooperation with the Tropical Atlantic countries regarding maritime affairs. The PADDLE project (EU RISE) aims to assess, in a north-south context, precisely how countries on the “Atlantic Boarder”, namely Senegal, Cape Verde and Brazil, encompass this trend towards MSP within their legal, institutional and political frameworks, following blue economy options and blue growth strategies. This contribution is an updated output of an international PADDLE project expert assessment, held in Brazil in February 2019, following two years of research. It intends to summarize the main conclusions on the state of the art and MSP prospects in the Tropical Atlantic, also referring to the ongoing MSP process in several EU countries. Political, legal and institutional frameworks enhancing MSP were presented and future trends for tropical MSP governance discussed. © 2020},

	abstract = {In the European Union, Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) has been regarded as a means of promoting the sustainable growth of the blue economy. Consequently, where the planning outcomes affect the business operations in marine areas, commercial and industry stakeholders should have an important role in the planning process. However, the business perspective in MSP has gained little attention in stakeholder involvement literature. The aim of this study is to elaborate on the business sector's interest and involvement in MSP in the Baltic Sea region. The findings are based on the first-hand experiences of MSP authorities and experts. Furthermore, perspectives from two sea-use sectors, maritime transport and marine tourism, have been investigated using online questionnaires to discover their views. The study focuses on the questions of who to involve and what are the driving forces promoting business sector involvement. Even though MSP is a form of broad-scale planning, the results indicate that all spatial and organisational scales from local to international and from small enterprises to umbrella organisations should be considered when designing approach to business stakeholder participation. The planning authorities need to consider what are the benefits and challenges of involving different types of business stakeholders. Planners often rely on organisations that represent business stakeholders and individual companies. It is resource effective to interact with representatives as they are considered to have a wide and general knowledge of the respective sector's interests. However, in some cases it is beneficial to also integrate individual companies, especially in local or regional contexts. © 2020 The Authors},

Currently, there is a lack of accurate and continuous SST prediction for this region due to the high cost of collecting the samples (e.g., cost of buoys, maintenance, severe weather). In this work, we use SST data from satellite images and in situ measurements collected by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to develop multifidelity forecasting models. This multifidelity framework is based on autoregressive Gaussian process schemes that systematically exploit all correlations between data from multiple heterogeneous spatiotemporal sources with various degrees of fidelity. This enables us to obtain implicitly their functional relationships and, at the same time, quantify the uncertainty of the data-driven predictions. Specifically, in the current work, we develop and validate progressively more complex models, including temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal multifidelity hindcast predictions of SST in the Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays. Together with these predictions, we present for the first time uncertainty maps for the region. ©2020. The Authors.},

This is clearly illustrated by the emergence of multiple agendas focused on blue growth and wealth from the oceans. These initiatives seek to balance economic activities with broader concerns across the range of ocean activities including fishing, other resource extraction, tourism, energy and shipping. Achieving long-term blue economy goals requires healthy oceans and depends upon sustainable activities. In particular, attention must be paid to environmental concerns and particularly the emerging and future impacts of climate change. This chapter seeks to highlight opportunities and challenges by focusing upon the intersection of climate change and fisheries management in the Indian Ocean region and specifically the small island states. The activities of key regional organizations are analysed, as well as international treaty regimes and inter-governmental organizations operating in the regional setting. The chapter analyses how these organizations and regimes are engaging with critical climate change and fisheries issues for the small island states and what further action is needed to support blue growth agenda. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2020.

The functional requirements were determined from descriptions of the use cases, specifications of hardware that are used or closely associated with existing ocean observation platforms, and direct feedback from ocean observation sensor/platform developers and users. Twenty types of functional requirements were identified, including those associated with power and energy use; physical system requirements; temperature and depth; electrical, acoustic, and motion interference; and reliability. Each set of functional requirements is illustrated as features of the use cases.

By surveying both coastal tourists and residents regarding their stakeholders, coastal resources, and tourism service characteristics, this chapter concludes that such a threat is not impeding progress because coastal tourists and residents have not only overlapping desires but also have interchangeable identities. By conducting tourism service quality management, China's coastal regions have the potential to satisfy both tourists and residents' needs simultaneously by taking advantage of the blue economy transition. © 2021, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {The “Blue Economy (BE)” is an increasingly popular concept as a strategy for safeguarding the world's oceans and water resources. It may emerge when economic activity is in balance with the long term capacity of ocean ecosystems to support the activity in a sustainable manner. Importantly, the concept of BE posits the inherent conflicts between two discourses—growth and development, and protection of ocean resources. The inherent conflicts require solutions to embrace the opportunities associated with the ocean economy while recognizing and addressing its threats. The potential solutions on a global scale are advocated by the United Nations in their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, we notice that the identification of the scope and boundaries of the BE in line with the UN's SDGs is vague even challenging, and the key stakeholders and their interests and roles in the BE are also vague. This review examines the scientific evidence of the association between the BE and the UN's SDGs, and relevance and alignment of stakeholders on the link between the BE and SDGs. Based on a literature survey between 1998 and 2018, we find that BE is highly associated with SDGs 14–17. Notably, we find that stakeholders prefer SDG 3 Good Health & Well-Being and SDG 8 Decent Work & Economic Growth in the BE context. As stakeholder involvement shows some differences and variations in the relationship between the BE and SDGs, we consider that stakeholders can play some roles directly or indirectly in the BE-SDGs context. In order to set achievable goals and targets in BE-SDGs, we support that key stakeholders should be identified to play several important roles in prosperous economic, societal development and setting tolerable ranges for the ocean biosphere. © 2020 The Authors},

The member States of CARICOM lie in close proximity to each other, exhibit high dependency on a shared space and resources and seek to establish a mutually beneficial interaction through an already institutionalized regional integration movement. Within CARICOM however, there is the problematic existence of different understandings of what the blue economy represents. This is illustrated through the use of case studies of three CARICOM countries, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize and Grenada. Competing interpretations of the blue economy complicate global engagement and lead to a re-emergence of issues which the Caribbean Community have never fully confronted and resolved. It is found that CARICOM needs to facilitate discussion, understanding and compromise among its members to arrive at an agreed policy and strategy that would effectively co-ordinate and operationalize blue economy development in the region. Such an understanding would enable CARICOM to optimise the collective economic, social and environmental benefits of the blue economy and allow the regional grouping to be an influential actor in all aspects of blue economy discourse on the global stage. © 2020},

While many disciplines touch upon the concept of blue economy, little literature exists on how a sustainable blue economy approach can help bridge poverty-environment challenges, particularly at the community level. To illustrate this, we present three case studies of blue economy practices initiated and implemented by coastal communities in China, Samoa, and Vietnam. The outcomes from each case study are examined based on both their environmental and socio-economic impact. Lessons learned include the significant role of science and technology in innovating solutions, the crucial impact of community leaders in encouraging and amplifying both local needs and solutions, continuous advocacy, fulfilling the very important need for communities to witness tangible benefits of project implementation, and last but not least the availability of resources and know-how resulting from multi-stakeholder partnerships including local governing councils, NGOs, and community members. Local communities have an unrecognized potential for adaptation and innovation and that more proactive public policies are required to achieve environmental and poverty reduction objectives simultaneously. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The African coastline is bordered by highly valuable marine ecosystems, but the environmental degradation due to anthropogenic pressure alter the benefits that they render to people. Our paper aims at assessing the value of ecosystem services provided by mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and kelp forests present in the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of Africa. After the mapping of coastal marine habitats, our valuation relies on the transfer of value of all ecosystem services from reference monetary unit values, extracted from the literature. A habitat functionality index based on the assumption that a higher population density and a higher demographic growth rate lead to a decrease in the functionality and services of marine habitats was then defined and incorporated into the valuation. The surveyed coastal habitats cover about 117,000 km2, with seagrass beds being by far the most extensive habitat. Present all along the coasts of Africa, their surface area represents about 62% of surveyed coastal habitats, followed by the mangroves (23%), coral reefs (15%). Kelp forests are only present in the southern Benguela Current LME. We estimated the annual value of the LME's coastal ecosystem services at 814 billion USD. Coral reefs have the highest value (588 billion USD/year), followed by seagrass beds (135 billion USD/year), mangroves (91 billion USD/year), and kelp forests (0.4 billion USD/year). The results show that ecosystem services from the four coastal habitat types had the highest value in the Agulhas Current LME, representing 38% of the total value, followed by the Red Sea LME (28%) and the Somali Coastal Current LME (10%). The three LMEs of the Atlantic side represent 15% of the total estimated value. Our paper highlighted many gaps that remain to be filled in terms of mapping and ecosystem services assessment in Africa. Nonetheless, our estimated values can facilitate dialogue between decision-makers and managers, and between countries sharing the same habitats and marine resources, toward better management of these ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In Mexico's Gulf of California and Baja California Peninsula (GCBP), marine ecosystems support tourism activities in many communities, but to date there have been no region-wide studies to estimate their benefits or identify key species. Based on data collected in this study, each year nature-based marine tourism in the GCBP results in 896,000 visits, US$518 million in expenditures and at least 3,575 direct jobs from formal operations. In interviews with operators, over 40 species groups were named as important; sea lions, whale sharks, whales, and marlin were the highest ranked, highlighting the importance of ecosystem-wide health for nature-based tourism sustainability. Local employment and the ability to make economic and conservation goals compatible were noted by operators as significant opportunities provided by nature-based marine tourism; challenges included pollution and declines in ecosystem health, a lack of infrastructure, poor resource management policies, and high operating costs. As nature-based marine tourism expands, a wider transition to true ecotourism, a focus on equitable benefits and collaboration between stakeholders and a cross-scale and ecosystem approach to management will be vital for achieving potential sustainable social, ecological and economic benefits. © 2020 United Nations},

	abstract = {Aquaculture development is part of the Blue Economy narrative and it may offer opportunities for improving the well-being of coastal people and the wider population. However, unlocking its full potential is unlikely to occur through sole focus on increasing production. Using a framework for identifying the “people-policy gap” in aquaculture as a starting point, we introduce benefit sharing as a necessary and complementary concept to filling this gap, as well as the notion of policy coherence to achieve equitable aquaculture development. We examine these concepts in the context of mariculture development through an analysis of national mariculture policies and plans from a selection of Western Indian Ocean (WIO) countries. Our analysis shows that whilst important building blocks and a common thrust for equitable mariculture development exist at regional level, mechanisms through which the benefits from mariculture development are to reach stakeholders affected directly and indirectly by mariculture operations at national levels are not adequately considered. Lack of policy coherence at national level not only prevents progress towards closing the “people-policy gap” in mariculture development, but it may also jeopardise how the sector can live up to its expectations in the region. On the basis of these considerations, we extend our reflection to the aquaculture sector as a whole and argue that policy coherence and benefit sharing should become key considerations in the planning and future development of sustainable and equitable aquaculture. © 2020},

We adapted and applied a model for evaluating sustainability transition experiments to visualize what ought to be the ingredients of an experimental agenda focused in advancing the country's marine spatial planning (MSP) as a fundamental instrument for achieving a shared Vision of blue economy for Brazil. Our results point that such a vision does not currently exist to guide the ocean governance system, raising attention for potential gaps in the consideration of environmental sustainability and social equity that needs to be addressed when shaping one. We discuss what ought to be the core ingredients of a national-level transition experiment for advancing MSP in Brazil (inputs, processes, outcomes and results). The adoption of a network-based MSP transition experiment in Brazil, from an initial technically-oriented to a subsequent process-oriented approach, may improve the sociopolitical arena's functional ocean governability, by (1) promoting a process-framework for improving the overall presence and quality of area-based governance-related knowledge-exchange; (2) supporting the policy-innovators quest for integrated governance through imagination and rationalization of appropriate institutional changes; (3) providing space for streamlining disparate governance responses into co-evolutionary pathways; (4) measuring improvements in the performance of innovative governance attempts; and (5) allowing for involved parties to confront asymmetric power relations in the shaping of a more environmentally sustainable and socially equitable ocean economy. © 2020},

	abstract = {Algae and seaweed products have great potential to contribute significantly to a number of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as food security, good health, clean energy, industry innovation, and responsible production. This chapter is structured in four main sections and takes a macroeconomics perspective to explore the contribution of algae and seaweeds to sustainable economic growth. In the first section, the concepts and definitions of bioeconomy, blue economy, and circular economy are introduced. These concepts particularly fit the context in which algae and seaweed products are developed, as they are sustainably sourced and they enter varied industrial processes as intermediate inputs or by-products. The second section presents the complex portfolio of current and future applications of algae and seaweeds across and between main industrial sectors. The majority of the current products obtained from algae and seaweeds consist of high-value compounds for food, feed, pharmaceuticals, and cosmeceuticals, but innovative applications for biofuels, biofertilizers, and green chemicals are rapidly evolving. The third section discusses the supply chain characteristics, the vertical integration, and the market context in which producers of algae biomass and products operate. The fourth section presents macroeconomic data and indicators of production, trade, and comparative advantage of algae products and biomass. The availability of public data is quite limited. The EU is currently the main provider of data due to its bioeconomy strategy, R&D investments, and comparative advantage in producing algae and seaweed products. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the current technological and policy challenges to foster the role of algae in the bioeconomy, and highlights the need for more accurate data for thorough economic analyses and policy evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Human interventions on coastal areas are always causing environmental impact; however, most of the times inventories of those interventions are possibly not well structured, and surely without a specific standard. The raw data presented shows an exhaustive and systematic revision of satellite images on 1700 km of the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where 2743 human interventions were identified. These interventions are classified in 38 categories in order to assess their environmental impact at a regional scale. The filtered data shows the environmental impact obtained for each category and the values allotted to each of the four parameters used for this evaluation. Moreover, the data is filtered for each of the five environmental coastal units in which the Caribbean coast of Colombia is divided by national regulations. Finally, the filtered and processed data shows the analysis done to obtain the graphical results of a previously paper (An evaluation of human interventions in the anthropogenically disturbed Caribbean Coast of Colombia [1]). Therefore, this dataset comprises three spreadsheets (xlsx) and two geographical files (kmz), which are ready to be used for any researcher, decision maker, land planner or practitioner interested in making further analysis on environmental impact assessment in coastal areas. Additionally, the dataset is carefully organised for educational exercises in such a manner that professors or lecturers can repeat the same steps in this study area or in their own, from the inventory to the final results. © 2020 The Author(s)},

The present study discusses the problems and opportunities associated with an integrated aquaculture development along the coast of Andalusia through an in-depth analysis of legislative documents and face-to-face interviews. The findings suggest that the management of the aquaculture sector has been characterized by a sectoral approach with little integration into the existing economic activities and socio-cultural context leading to conflicts among fisheries and lack of acceptance from local communities. During the last decade, the regional competent authority and the aquaculture sector implemented several strategies to improve the integration with the other coastal users and enhance the social acceptability of this activity in the area. © 2020 by the authors.

To move towards a higher sustainability of echinoculture, this study proposes a sustainable feed for Paracentrotus lividus. Two experimental formulations were obtained using discarded endive (Cichorium endivia) leaves and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) industry discards in different proportions, and agar as a binder. The evaluation of the feed stability showed that the feed was stable for 72 hr, allowing a suitable feeding for sea urchins. Both formulations showed a proper nutritional value and fatty acid profile, corresponding to the features of the main ingredients and resulting suitable for echinoculture. A bioenergetic trial was carried out to measure daily ingestion rate, absorption efficiency and gonado-somatic index in sea urchins. They resulted also palatable and well absorbed by sea urchins, especially that one with higher fish content. At the end of the experiment, an increase in gonado-somatic index was also recorded. Despite further analysis is needed to assess the performance of the feed in terms of gonad yield and quality, these encouraging results indicate that food industry discards may be suitable alternative ingredients for the production of sustainable feeds for sea urchin aquaculture. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {The language and practice of Marine spatial planning (MSP) is typically associated with state-led multi-sectoral planning efforts. Yet in countries like India, where the government is not yet promoting MSP, ocean space has already been divided using principles and practices that are characteristic of MSP elsewhere in the world. Instead of being initiated by the state, these MSP-like processes are initiated by international agencies when industries seek large-scale development of India’s marine ecosystems. Although intended as an inclusive, holistic process to plan industrial development, this assemblage of MSP technologies, processes, and practices mandated by international corporations produces a particular power relation through its rejection of local knowledge and insistence on data, for instance, in the form of discrete, geo-coded polygons. This paper argues that this form of MSP produces an ontological politics, despite emerging from seemingly rational, post-political, and technocratic processes. Engaging with such politics is increasingly possible with access to geographical information systems, and this, therefore, provides a novel space in which to engage in political struggle. The case of externally mandated MSP in India demonstrates that non-state actors can initiate MSP, and therefore, opens the possibility for fishing communities, as non-state actors, to directly engage with the assemblage of practices that produce MSP. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

In this context, multilateral, corporate and financial attention dedicated to so-called ‘blue growth’ and ‘blue economy’ schemes has been extraordinary; consequentially spawning critical inquiries into the origins and motives behind these initiatives. Offering different analytical interpretations of contemporary blue economy politics, as well as their origins and effects, geographers have entered this debate with a strong focus on institutional discourses and policy agendas. Building on critical political economy of ocean space literatures, this paper emphasises instead the role of capital in appropriating and re-organising the seas according to its own needs. Our primary aim is to elucidate the territorial-economic tensions and geopolitical antagonisms that drive current trends by historicising the emergence of the Blue Economy Paradigm (BEP).

	abstract = {Coastal marine environments provide livelihoods as billions of people around the world depend greatly on sustainability efforts in the Blue Economy. In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities. © Copyright © 2020 Hoerterer, Schupp, Benkens, Nickiewicz, Krause and Buck.},

Advances in the research are progressively uncovering the presence of unknown microorganisms, which have evolved unique metabolic and genetic pathways for the production of uncommon secondary metabolites. Fungi have a leading role in marine bioprospecting since they represent a prolific source of structurally diverse bioactive metabolites. Several bioactive compounds from marine fungi have already been characterized including antibiotics, anticancer, antioxidants and antivirals. Nowadays, the search for natural antioxidant molecules capable of replacing those synthetic currently used, is an aspect that is receiving significant attention. Antioxidants can inactivate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, preventing the insurgence of several degenerative diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, they also find applications in different fields, including food preservation, healthcare and cosmetics. This review focuses on the production of antioxidants from marine fungi. We begin by proposing a survey of the available tools suitable for the evaluation of antioxidants, followed by the description of various classes of marine fungi antioxidants together with their extraction strategies. In addition, a view of the future perspectives and trends of these natural products within the “blue economy” is also presented. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The ocean plays a crucial role in the functioning of the Earth System and in the provision of vital goods and services. The United Nations (UN) declared 2021–2030 as the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The Roadmap for the Ocean Decade aims to achieve six critical societal outcomes (SOs) by 2030, through the pursuit of four objectives (Os). It specifically recognizes the scarcity of biological data for deep-sea biomes, and challenges the global scientific community to conduct research to advance understanding of deep-sea ecosystems to inform sustainable management. In this paper, we map four key scientific questions identified by the academic community to the Ocean Decade SOs: (i) What is the diversity of life in the deep ocean? (ii) How are populations and habitats connected? (iii) What is the role of living organisms in ecosystem function and service provision? and (iv) How do species, communities, and ecosystems respond to disturbance? We then consider the design of a global-scale program to address these questions by reviewing key drivers of ecological pattern and process. We recommend using the following criteria to stratify a global survey design: biogeographic region, depth, horizontal distance, substrate type, high and low climate hazard, fished/unfished, near/far from sources of pollution, licensed/protected from industry activities. We consider both spatial and temporal surveys, and emphasize new biological data collection that prioritizes southern and polar latitudes, deeper (> 2000 m) depths, and midwater environments. We provide guidance on observational, experimental, and monitoring needs for different benthic and pelagic ecosystems. We then review recent efforts to standardize biological data and specimen collection and archiving, making “sampling design to knowledge application” recommendations in the context of a new global program. We also review and comment on needs, and recommend actions, to develop capacity in deep-sea research; and the role of inclusivity - from accessing indigenous and local knowledge to the sharing of technologies - as part of such a global program. We discuss the concept of a new global deep-sea biological research program ‘Challenger 150,’ highlighting what it could deliver for the Ocean Decade and UN Sustainable Development Goal 14. © Copyright © 2020 Howell, Hilário, Allcock, Bailey, Baker, Clark, Colaço, Copley, Cordes, Danovaro, Dissanayake, Escobar, Esquete, Gallagher, Gates, Gaudron, German, Gjerde, Higgs, Le Bris, Levin, Manea, McClain, Menot, Mestre, Metaxas, Milligan, Muthumbi, Narayanaswamy, Ramalho, Ramirez-Llodra, Robson, Rogers, Sellanes, Sigwart, Sink, Snelgrove, Stefanoudis, Sumida, Taylor, Thurber, Vieira, Watanabe, Woodall and Xavier.},

	abstract = {Blue Economy has emerged as a new development paradigm to spur growth dynamism in littoral countries with strong adherence to the set norms associated with environmental and ecological sustainability. Consisting of the ocean and ocean-related activities such as fisheries, port and shipping, deep sea mining, ocean energy, coastal tourism, ecosystem services and marine services, it offers huge potential for economic expansion. As countries compete over finite land resources, the next competition among countries is expected to be in the domain of ocean sector. Moreover, maritime transport continues to remain a crucial means of navigation and trade. Many Asian and African coastal nations have long coastlines and large coastal communities which could provide much-needed trigger to the process of economic development. For the purpose of planning for investment, employment, growth and non-traditional security issues, knowledge about potentials of Blue Economy sectors is paramount. For this purpose, understanding about ‘Stylised facts’ of the Blue Economy is necessary which is not available in the literature. Some of the key sectors linked with food security, nutritional security and livelihood security like the fishery sector is associated with Blue Economy. Eastern African countries such as Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Comoros and others are located in the Indian Ocean Rim. Their strategic location in the Indian Ocean provides huge opportunities for unleashing the potential of marine resources for the expansion of businesses, promoting entrepreneurship, increasing exports, creating jobs, and empowering the native coastal communities. With growing awareness about Blue Economy and the advancement of technologies, it can offer tremendous investment opportunities and provide a necessary trigger to the growth momentum. Despite long coastlines and endowment of various ocean resources, the Eastern African countries have not yet optimally harnessed this sector for the attainment of economic growth and other developmental objectives. This chapter discusses the concept, definitions and potential of Blue Economy in Africa including detailed coverage of fisheries, marine minerals, marine biological resources and  coastal tourism. The role of India and Japan cooperation under the initiative of AAGC to promote Blue Economy in the Afro-Asian region is also highlighted. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

	abstract = {The term ‘Blue Economy’ emphasizes essentially an ocean-dependent economic development to improve quality of life of people. India committed to advance the “Blue Economy” and several programs have been initiated to promote blue economy in the country. One of the important components of promoting blue economy is to have adequate information about sea bed and mineral resources, in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), Legal Continental Shelf as well as High Seas. Apart from placer minerals on the coast, we need to explore for minerals, such as manganese nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt crusts in High Seas. The availability of gas hydrates on our continental shelf has huge potential to satisfy our ever-increasing energy requirements. We need to invest in developing technology and human resources to utilize these resources. At the same time, the development of offshore mineral and energy resources will need setting up of infrastructure facilities on the coast. As coastal zone is vulnerable to many hazards such as cyclones, storm surges, tsunamis, coastal erosion, sea level rise, etc., an assessment of coastal vulnerability to understand risks involved, has to be undertaken. Various environmental data will be required to utilize ocean resources. An institutional framework for implementing activities related to blue economy to be set up so that investments in building infrastructure, developing human resources, and setting up governance system shall pay rich dividends for future generations and ensure sustainability. © 2020 Geological Survey of India.

This type of so-called “patriotic tourism” has the potential to increase tensions in the South China Sea. It also gives rise to problems for successful implementation of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative.

	abstract = {The Blue Economy constitutes a large and fast growing part of the European Economy. In 2017, it accounted for nearly € 74.3 billion in gross operating profit, and an annual turnover of approximately € 658 billion. Among all blue economic sectors, cruise tourism is one of the most important ones, with the Mediterranean region still accounting for the second most popular cruise destination in the world, after the Caribbean. The contribution of the cruise sector to the local economies of most ports of call however, proves to be quite limited, with negative externalities often surpassing derived benefits. Promoting and integrating ‘traditional’ products into cruise supply chains can be a promising solution addressing this situation. It may also provide passengers with an enhanced local-tasting experience that may make their journey even more memorable. Focusing on Greece and its numerous ports integrated into various cruise itineraries, this paper explores cruise network characteristics and identifies local products that can be promoted at different ports of call for boosting customer experience. Through a novel e-marketplace that is being outlined, cruise companies will be able to directly connect with local producers and suppliers and place their orders. Seamless information may also provide benefits with regard to improving transport and logistics processes. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines potential opportunities for Africa's Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) development driven by blue economy from key strategic sectors including: Coastal and Marine Tourism; Climate Resilience; Environment; Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services and Infrastructure. The sectoral approach is key to economic development in Africa with potential for income generation, employment creation and poverty reduction, as well as creating blue and green carbon sinks to address climate change problem and environmental management in African LMEs. The sectors establish linkages to countries' established Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change making it possible to promote Integrated Approach at national, regional and continental sustainable development in Africa. The approach is complemented by the utilizing desk-top literature review and secondary data source on LMEs in Africa for blue economy. This approach is supplemented with professional experts' views and opinions, and additional data gathered from field visits to 13 African countries in August 2019 and Nairobi, Kenya Africa Blue Economy Strategy Consultative Workshop in October 2019. The Blue Economy approach development in Africa will benefit both inland and coastal countries. It is recommended that a strong development of the continental tourism will boost the demand for tourism services and infrastructures. The development of eco-tourism will contribute to the conservation of ecosystems and reduce the ecological footprint. Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services offer an opportunity to develop coastal wetland projects to mitigating climate change. Coastal protection, biomass production and water purification are among the most important ecosystem services delivered by African LMEs. Their current value is estimated to the average monetary value of carbon sequestration of about USD 130,000 per km2 of mangrove, salt marshes and sea grasses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The new blue economy will require new ways of producing, storing, and using energy as technologies and industries move further from shore-based power grids to collect new data sets and use the ocean in new ways. And coastal communities are seeking to integrate renewables to improve energy resilience, reduce carbon emissions, and power clean ports and industries. At the same time, the energy sector is undergoing a revolution toward renewable, distributed technologies that rely on energy storage and smart grid technology. Blue economy and energy technology trends are intersecting creating new challenges and opportunities for cross-sector collaboration. Marine energy (power from waves, tidal currents, ocean currents, and ocean thermal gradients) holds promise as a source of power for the new blue economy. The successful development of marine energy faces many technical, social, and market challenges-as well as access to data and information emerging from the new blue economy. Meeting the full potential of marine energy will require innovation and codevelopment across energy and ocean technology sectors; an improved understanding of ocean physical, biological, and social systems; and new public sector partnerships to coordinate and leverage research and development investments. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.
