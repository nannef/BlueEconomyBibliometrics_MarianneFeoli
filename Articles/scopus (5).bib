	abstract = {The economic philosophy of the Blue Economy was first introduced in 1994 by Professor Gunter Pauli at the United Nations University (UNU) to reflect the needs of future growth and prosperity, along with the threats posed by global warming. Thereafter, the Blue Economy assumed greater importance after the Third Earth Summit Conference - Rio+20 in 2012. The conference focused on expanding the concept of Green Economy to the Blue Economy. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 sought to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development"as a guiding principle for global governance and use of ocean resources. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has recently rolled out the Draft Blue Economy policy for India. The policy document aims to enhance the contribution of the blue economy to India's GDP, improve the lives of coastal communities, preserve marine biodiversity, and maintain the national security of marine areas and resources.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blue Growth, a term first coined by the European Commission as "an initiative to harness the untapped potential of Europe's oceans, seas and coasts", identified rich marine resources as an unique asset for economic development in coastal regions and on islands. The European Commission has through the Blue Growth objectives for the first time highlighted marine sectors as unique market opportunities with high growth potential which carry socio-economic importance to the development of coastal regions. Particularly marine sectors such as aquaculture, marine robotics, and marine renewable energy which fulfil global needs in food safety and security, enable monitoring and exploration in harsh and remote conditions, and globally growing energy needs were recognized as catalysts to achieve sustainable development. Marine start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) were identified as potential drivers in emerging marine sectors. However, they require support mechanisms tailored to their needs as they are competing for the same business and financial support as land-based SMEs, yet the research and development infrastructure is more difficult to access.ProtoAtlantic, an Interreg Atlantic Area funded project, provided marine-specific support mechanisms to marine start-ups and SMEs in emerging sectors, including business support through the accelerator and mentorship programs, enabling companies to fast track their product development through access to prototyping and testing facilities in all partner regions. The Interreg Atlantic Area encompasses partner regions in France, Ireland, Portugal, Scotland, and Spain. The consortium partners consist of Technopôle Brest Iroise (Brest, France), University College Cork - UCC (Cork, Ireland), County Council Cork (Cork, Ireland), INESC TEC (Porto, Portugal), the European Marine Energy Centre - EMEC (Orkney, Scotland), EMERGE (Canary Islands, Spain), and the lead partner, Innovalia Association (Canary Islands, Spain). The strategic collaboration between the partners provided marine start-ups access to testing facilities in the Atlantic Ocean. The extreme living laboratories provided by EMEC, the LiR National Ocean Testing Facilities at UCC's Centre of Marine and Renewable Energy (MaREI centre), and INESC TEC promise harsh real-life conditions which test the suitability of marine technologies to the limit thereby providing start-ups and SMEs with an extra layer of confidence in developing their technologies. This cross-regional collaboration puts the ProtoAltantic program in a unique position, as it is the first of its kind to dedicate marine-specific support to marine start-ups and SMEs which have benefited from the opportunities that ProtoAtlantic has provided.ProtoAtlantic developed a holistic model for the prototyping and exploitation of innovative ideas in emerging maritime sectors. After the identification of ideas from the research community, start-ups, and SMEs with product innovation capacity in the maritime sector, an acceleration program with a normed and structured process was implemented, thus creating a unique ecosystem in the Atlantic that is addressing a co-creation paradigm with the local European start-ups communities and all the stakeholders. © 2022 IEEE.},

The policy aspects are explored through the lens of the blue economy as an overarching governance mechanism and the main instrument to implement it, marine spatial planning. The societal elements of ORE are explored via the lens of the just transition, a concept that is gaining policy traction as a defining principle of the energy and climate transition. The unique oceanic and coastal nature of offshore wind, wave and tidal is unpacked in the context of a just transition, with a synopsis of the performance these sectors in providing employment and the role of revitalizing coastal communities.

This trend leads to various types of ocean and coastal pollution. Accordingly, rules and regulations relating to oceans and coasts are changing continuously. This chapter discusses the changes which have taken place over time in the rules and regulations regarding the management of coastal and marine resources. The manner in which maritime standards have evolved within the international, regional and national legal frameworks governing the sustainable use of marine resources and management have also been discussed. As per the analysis, it is clear that a robust framework exists within which the Blue Economy in the region as well as in India can thrive rapidly. It is also clear that there is a huge thrust on the development of the Blue Economy, especially since 2014, both internationally and regionally. India has had a reasonably strong economic development framework since the early 1970s. Legislations such as the Merchant Shipping Act, the Maritime Zones Act, the MPEDA, the Regulation of Foreign Fishing Vessels Act and the Major Ports Act have laid a strong foundation for blue economic development. It is perhaps time to streamline the same and focus on the enabling framework to promote blue economy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Many western countries show an increased interest in using algae in several sectors such as human food and animal feed, nutraceuticals, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, agriculture, or bioenergy. Biomass of marine origin, and especially seaweed, is a key element for blue growth and is expected to contribute to the development of the growing European blue economy. Several Research and Development and Research and Innovation Projects result in the establishment of an emerging seaweed aquaculture in the Northern European countries. However, macroalgal cultivation and bioprocessing is still scarce in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Tunisia, where seaweeds are abundant on its coast, they remain little exploited. Ongoing projects from different research institutes focus on biological activities of macroalgae, the extraction of active compounds, and the potential uses as phycocolloids, pigments, lipids, and bioactive metabolites characterization as well as bioproduct enhancement. The results of these investigations demonstrate that macroalgae from the Tunisian coasts are a source of valuable compounds and that they can be used as a natural renewable resource suitable for a large array of industrial applications. Further to this, specific research activities on seaweed cultivation have been conducted particularly for Gracilaria and Ulva. In this paper, we highlight the potential of the seaweed sector in Tunisia in terms of biodiversity, cultivation, and bioprocessing and discuss the challenges in various sectors, i.e., biology, building capacity, technology, or policy, that currently hinder the expansion of a sustainable Tunisian seaweed industry. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Ocean Acidification (OA) is often referred to as 'an evil twin of climate change'. Increased global atmospheric emission of CO2 has increased its concentration in the ocean due to dissolution and absorption of atmospheric CO2, leading to ocean acidification. This further affects the coral reefs and other calcifiers such as Pteropods (marine snails), shellfish (clams, etc.), crustaceans (shrimp and lobsters), starfish, sea urchins, and their kin (echinoderms) and interferes with the marine food web and leads to food shortages thereby affecting the socio-economic lives of the people living in the coastal area. To quantify the above impacts and to study other biochemical variations in the ocean, it is necessary to monitor ocean acidification for a longer time period. Current methods for monitoring ocean acidification employ gliders, drifters, buoys, mooring, and periodic testing of samples collected during research voyages. These methods are often not cost-effective, time-efficient, requires a lot of manpower, and provides inferior spatio-temporal resolution. This research work analyzes the existing ocean acidification data collected from the ALOHA station at the North Pacific Ocean and propose a predictive model at the edge level by using Regression to reduce the effective cost of the IoT system. The proposed regression model is also used to design a novel IoT architecture for designing an energy-efficient, near real-time ocean acidification monitoring model. The proposed IoT hardware can be deployed by using buoys and fishing boats to further reduce the monitoring cost and increase the spatio-temporal resolution of the data compared to the existing monitoring systems.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this article, we present Bio-GO-SHIP, a new ocean observing program that will incorporate sustained and consistent global biological ocean observations into the Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP). The goal of Bio-GO-SHIP is to produce systematic and consistent biological observations during global ocean repeat hydrographic surveys, with a particular focus on the planktonic ecosystem. Ocean plankton are an essential component of the earth climate system, form the base of the oceanic food web and thereby play an important role in influencing food security and contributing to the Blue Economy. Despite its importance, ocean biology is largely under-sampled in time and space compared to physical and chemical properties. This lack of information hampers our ability to understand the role of plankton in regulating biogeochemical processes and fueling higher trophic levels, now and in future ocean conditions. Traditionally, many of the methods used to quantify biological and ecosystem essential ocean variables (EOVs), measures that provide valuable information on the ecosystem, have been expensive and labor- and time-intensive, limiting their large-scale deployment. In the last two decades, new technologies have been developed and matured, making it possible to greatly expand our biological ocean observing capacity. These technologies, including cell imaging, bio-optical sensors and 'omic tools, can be combined to provide overlapping measurements of key biological and ecosystem EOVs. New developments in data management and open sharing can facilitate meaningful synthesis and integration with concurrent physical and chemical data. Here we outline how Bio-GO-SHIP leverages these technological advances to greatly expand our knowledge and understanding of the constituents and function of the global ocean plankton ecosystem.

	abstract = {This chapter provides an assessment of the value of marine ecosystems. Figures show a high value but there are major differences between studies. Notwithstanding this, their importance is clear. It is also clear that the trend is for a decline in most ecosystem services derived from such ecosystems in spite of higher levels of exploitation, because of the degradation to the ecosystems in many locations. The causes of the degradation are over exploitation, misuse of the marine biomes as a waste sink, conversion of coastal systems, and loss of habitat and climate change. This degradation is not inevitable and can be reversed. A key role in doing so is to estimate the costs and benefits of marine-related activities and the incorporation of those costs in setting regulations and designing policies to manage the marine environment. The chapter has reviewed a range of instruments, to see how they can help to move the use of these ecosystems towards a more sustainable use. At present, while there are some developments that indicate a shift in a more encouraging direction, we also have government interventions, particularly some subsidies that are harmful to the marine environment. There is also a greater need to increase cooperation in setting regulations that apply across extra-territorial jurisdictions. Finally, management in this area has to take account not only of the overall costs and benefits of different interventions, but also pay special attention to the way in which they impact on the many vulnerable groups that depend on marine resources for their livelihoods. Sadly, their conditions are worsening in many countries. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Here we propose a framework and agenda for nutrition-sensitive governance (NSG) of fisheries that rethink dominant paradigms of fisheries governance and propose measures to incorporate nutrition-related objectives into fisheries governance. Fish, rich in micronutrients, have potential for improving the nutritional status of coastal and riparian communities, particularly in the Global South where inadequate nutrition is prevalent. Yet, the potential for fish to alleviate malnutrition remains limited to policy documents and high-level government commitments. We propose an agenda for NSG in the Global South grounded in three main pillars: 1-extending the boundaries of fisheries governance, 2-integrating multiple forms of knowledge, and 3-prioritizing domestic and local needs; each of these pillars links different levels of governance starting at the level of conceptualization and images connected to what fisheries are and should do, to a more policy-oriented level with hands-on recommendations, through an intermediate level that links the two. Overall, we propose a concept and agenda for NSG grounded in a human-centred approach to fisheries governance with social sciences playing a crucial role in unearthing the nodes of power that limit access and agency of poor and vulnerable (fishing) communities to the nutritional benefits of fish. In doing so, we critically analyze dominant fisheries governance agendas (‘Blue Economy’, ‘Blue Growth’) through the lens of food and nutrition security and anchor these debates to the objective of getting the right nutrients to those who need them most. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Yet, human activities in the ocean have long been managed using a sectoral approach (e.g., fisheries, biodiversity protection, energy production, shipping) rather than a holistic integration of sector interactions, trade-offs, costs, and benefits. Coordination across sectors is now more critical than ever, not only because of the expanding human footprint but also because of climate change impacts on the ocean. Sustainable global ocean use can support the Blue Economy while also reversing negative climate impacts on the ocean. Advancements in science and technology, along with increasing momentum on global commitments to sound ocean governance, and science diplomacy internationally can support sustainable ocean use with accurate and timely information about the status and trends in the ocean's ecosystem services (benefits) to society. Near-real time information about ecosystem services’ dynamics is critical to policymaking for a sustainable Blue Economy that works for nature and people in an ever-changing ocean.

	abstract = {Indonesia is strategically located and has more sea and water than land, so it has a huge potential for marine fishery resources. The potential for implementing the Blue Economy in Indonesia is very wide open. The Blue Economy is a way of thinking about development that is based on the economic value of Indonesia's marine resources. This adds value to the supply chain, directly or indirectly, and could improve people's lives. However, we know that fishermen have a weak bargaining position in selling their fish catch, sometimes sold through mediators/bonded money systems or directly at fish auctions/TPI without going through an auction. Because of this, fishermen and fishermen's cooperatives need an open-source software application to help them track and report their finances, such as the number of fish caught, sales, loans (debt), expenses, and profits. This study aims to show an application called Electronic Fish Solution that can keep track of and report on entities and business processes in fishermen's cooperatives and fishing businesses. This research develops a prototype of a fishing trading application to make it easier for fishers to market their catch. In software development, the research method is based on prototyping and testing usability with the UAT (User Acceptance Testing). This study used a web-based app that can be easily accessed from computers and phones. The UAT score was analyzed and calculated, and the result was 77.25. This means that the fisherman's app works perfectly and can be accepted by users.  © 2022 IEEE.},

South African coasts are a clear example of such economic fragmentations, largely as a result of the ubiquitous vestiges of apartheid era spatial planning. Previously, small formerly 'white' towns benefited through the doctrine of separate development, whereas rudimentary 'black' peripheral coastal towns remained underdeveloped, thus contributing to low levels of industrialization and high degrees of poverty and unemployment. This paper analyses the socio-economic impact of ocean industrialization on five rural coastal municipalities in two South African provinces. In tone with the rapidly growing concept of Blue Economy, the study proposes the concept of Seaside Community Industrial Hubs. The goal is to catapult an entrepreneurial state capable of leading a blue-collar economy through bespoke market-creating innovations adept to trigger sustainable development across all coastal regions. © 2022, IGI Global.

Simultaneously, a burgeoning body of literature on the blue economy is emerging from academia. This scoping analysis uses data from journal articles and policy documents to provide a preliminary understanding of how small-scale fisheries in the blue economy are framed by academics and policymakers. We found that high-level policies include ideal proposals for fisheries and other ocean sectors, but in ways that suit industrial-scale fisheries and aquaculture more than small-scale fisheries. Academics highlight emerging uncertainties for small-scale fisheries. The review points out differences between small-scale and industrial-scale fisheries, particularly the social aspects that could make small-scale fisheries more suitable for achieving some of the stated goals of a blue economy. We conclude that, while the blue economy in its broadest sense is still a work in progress, it should be guided by clearly articulated goals in terms of governance that supports small-scale fisheries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

However, relying solely on a few forms of renewable energy such as solar and onshore wind energy may not be sufficient to meet the future energy demand. In addition, issues related to intermittency of these resources are a challenge which needs to be overcome by exploring other forms of clean energy sources.

The COVID19 pandemic adds further challenges. This chapter investigates the dilemmas in three dominant areas: (i) the negotiation of new trade rules, particularly within subsidy disciplines; (ii) the implementation of trade measures on fisheries, such as import bans for fish implicated in ‘illegal, unreported and unregulated’ (IUU) fishing; and (iii) the settlement of trade disputes. Drawing on treaties, case-law and institutional developments, this chapter assesses global and regional regulation of fish production and consumption, including new developments in the blue economy, and provides insight into the role of trade law in modern international governance. © Oxford University Press 2022.

Established sectors contribute to the economy over the long term, such as the shipping sector, while emerging sectors have yet to mature, but are showing potential for future growth. The maritime industry has become an important sector of the economy today. And as everyone is striving for economic growth, a new magic word has been created: blue growth. Seas and oceans have the potential to generate new jobs and economic growth. Blue economy jobs in the EU are estimated at 5.4 million with a gross value added of about € 500 billion, according to the European Commission. The blue economy also plays an important role in the US economy. Globally in 2017, an estimated 3.32 million people was employed contributing to about $307 billion to the national gross domestic product (GDP). There has been strong growth in the blue economy over the past 15years. From 2005 to 2017, the blue economy grew at a rate of 3% per year-which is more than twice as fast as the US economy as a whole. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Blue economy goals emerged to harness the ocean’s benefits. Goals differ between regions and countries, though establishing and maintaining the health of the oceans is consistently at the core. Blue economy agenda incorporate several prongs, for example, fisheries and aquaculture; renewable ocean energy; seaports and shipping; offshore hydrocarbons and seabed minerals; and tourism. Healthy oceans and indeed abundantly stocked oceans ensures food security, particularly when reliance on fisheries as the main source of protein is expected to rise in the future. Fisheries security is directly affected by illegal fishing. To ensure current stocks are managed and declining stocks once again thrive, global, regional, and domestic regulatory efforts must seek to eliminate illegal fishing. Though, the problem does not end when fish are landed at the port. Globally inconsistent labeling regulations may provide opportunity for unsustainable and illegally caught fish to be distributed, processed and potentially exported, failing Sustainable Development Goals 2 (zero hunger) and 14 (life below the water). Due to inadequate labeling, consumers purchasing fish and fish products may lack critical information that could reduce demand of declining fish stocks, or catches that employ damaging methods. As such, greater transparency and consistency is needed in fish labeling to ensure consumers can make sustainable and environmentally responsible choices. While consumers are increasingly making sustainable choices, inadequate labeling laws and policies fail to inform these choices. Loopholes created enable opportunities for organized criminals to infiltrate, taking advantage of the consumer, the industry, and the fishery. Without clear and consistent labeling, efforts to comply with SDG 14 and promote SDG 2 are stunted due to food fraud. Useful insights intend to inform Australian and international policy- and decision-makers alike. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

This started in 2007 though the European Union Integrated Maritime Policy approach, and in 2009 the Africa Union initiated a similar process, leading both to the Africa integrated maritime strategy as well as a blue economy strategy. Several countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, began to look to blue economy as a booster to socioeconomic welfare and initiated the development of national strategies, together with the nec-essary adaptation of institutional and legal networks. Case studies address those processes at the transition from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans, focusing on Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Kenya in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, as well as several African Small Islands Developing States (SIDS), particularly Cape Verde, S. Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, Madagascar and Mauritius. Findings show that all countries covered in the case studies are developing national ocean and/or blue economy strategies and adapting their governmental, institutional, and legal frameworks, although there is a deeper political impact in SIDS. Overall, these new policy drivers are leading to a new model of ocean governance by addressing integrated maritime policies and blue growth strategies, as well as introducing MSP as a new EEZ governance tool. © 2022, Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association.

Often such a WEC is deployed in an ocean location with tidal currents or ocean streams, or serves as a mobile platform to power the blue economy. The shape of the floating body, or buoy, of the point absorber type WEC is important for the wave energy capture ratio and for the current drag force. In this paper, a new approach to optimize the shape of the point absorber buoy is developed to reduce the ocean current drag force on the buoy while capturing more energy from ocean waves. A specific parametric modelling is constructed to define the shape of the buoy with 12 parameters. The implantation of neural networks significantly reduces the computational time compared with solving hydrodynamics equations for each iteration. And the optimal shape of the buoy is solved using a genetic algorithm with multiple self-defined functions. The final optimal shape of the buoy in a case study reduces 68.7% of current drag force compared to a cylinder-shaped buoy, while maintaining the same level of energy capture ratio from ocean waves. The method presented in this paper has the capability to define and optimize a complex buoy shape, and solve for a multi-objective optimization problem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are essential to reach the UN Ocean’s Decade challenges and the Sustainable Development Goal 14 (life bellow water – conserve coastal and marine areas), and their crucial role for the health of the planet was highlighted in the United Nations Ocean Conference. However, often these MPA’s are no more than Paper Parks, with poor financial and human resources, thus lacking effectiveness. Moreover, they frequently trigger conflicts with local communities, by imposing restrictions to their activities with no alternative or compensations, causing serious governance inefficiencies. Thus, within the UN Oceans Decade, MPA’s must face simultaneously three of the challenges: Protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity (Challenge 2); Develop a sustainable and equitable ocean economy (Challenge 4) and Change humanity’s relationship with the ocean (Challenge 10). To address those challenges, it becomes clear that management models of MPA’s had to find ways to value natural capital and, at the same time, involve local communities and stakeholders in the governance processes. The conservation of biodiversity has both direct and indirect economic benefits for many sectors of the economy, namely tourism, being ecotourism considered one of the segments particularly adequate to value natural capital. Ecotourism, defined as “environmentally responsible travel and visitation to relatively undisturbed natural areas”, to enjoy and appreciate nature, is often used to enhance the natural capital, while protecting and promoting protected areas. Several studies have been carried out about ecotourism in MPA’s all over the world, particularly in the 21st century. In this article, we analyzed several case studies focusing ecotourism in MPAs, to better understand the connection between the development of this industry, the development of sustainable blue economy, and the efforts for ocean conservation. From the analysis conducted, we conclude that ecotourism development and community participation are of paramount importance in achieving sustainable development in MPAs, although there is still room to new advances improving good marine governance.

Existing ocean industries will have to adapt to rising sea levels, warming, and ocean acidification. Attempts to repair damages to ecosystems from past activity will be made more difficult by shifting baselines. Beyond adaptation, ocean economic activity must participate in the global effort to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But climate change will also bring some new opportunities for economic growth, including technological innovation and the opening of the Arctic. The policy responses to climate change’s effects on the blue economy will be dictated by a complex mix of global and local actions. Climate change’s effects are likely to cause disruptions that occur faster than existing institutions are designed to handle, necessitating organizational changes as a prerequisite to effective action. Information needs will escalate dramatically in the fields of physical, biological, and social systems and the interactions among these systems. There will also be a tendency to concentrate on local scale actions for adaptation, but if mitigation of climate change is not successful, most of the adaptation actions will prove temporary. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Marine natural resources support the blue economy and are major contributors to economic wealth as a result of their supply of goods and services. However, their ability to supply natural goods and services depends on how well marine resources and their biodiversity are conserved. In South Asia, the conservation of these resources and their biodiversity is far from ideal. This is because socioeconomic factors are unfavourable to the adoption of measures required to conserve these resources adequately. As is explained, this is common in low-income countries such as those in South Asia. Marine protected areas are mainly established to prevent the over-harvesting of resources, but sometimes they are completely protected from harvesting activities. They are one of the means available to help conserve marine biodiversity. The comparative extent to which Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have established marine protected areas is outlined, and their management of these areas is discussed. However, over-harvesting of marine resources is not the only threat to marine resources. Marine pollution is also a threat to their biodiversity and to their sustainable and efficient use. The extent and nature of marine pollution in South Asian maritime areas are investigated with particular attention being given to plastic wastes. Several species of sea turtles occur in South Asian marine areas. Aspects of economic development and social change (and the consequences of economic activity associated with the operation of the blue economy) pose a threat to these endangered species in South Asian maritime areas. The nature of these threats is outlined with particular attention being given to plastic wastes. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {The subject of global maritime security governance is usually framed by the concept of the global commons. Yet there are significant empirical and conceptual barriers to establishing a well-functioning and robust system of maritime security governance. First, the question remains open whether the high seas are intractably anarchical or potentially susceptible to a strong system of institutionalised governance. Second, maritime space itself resists a binary assessment of the existence or absence of security governance given the range of maritime spaces and their treatment in international law. Third, the securitisation process is not uniform spatially, a condition circumscribing the number of global maritime public security goods requiring collective action. The blue economy constitutes a fourth complication: some littoral states treat the “blue economy” as a problem of managing common-pool resources in order to maximise the extraction of ocean resources without depleting those (renewable) resources, whereas for others, the over-exploitation or fouling of the “blue economy” represents an existential threat to national food security. These potential barriers to maritime security governance raise five questions: What maritime domains are threatened and what are the nature of those threats? What are the necessary conditions requiring an effective system of MSG to emerge? What are the components of a system of MSG? Does the current governance system meet the criteria defining a system of security governance? The answers to these questions lead to a disappointing conclusion: the global system maritime security governance is underdeveloped at best. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Ruxandra-Laura Bosilca, Susana Ferreira and Barry J.

	abstract = {This chapter examines the advancement of science and technology and its prospect for blue growth in South Asia. The blue growth in South Asia has multiple prospects and opportunities including fisheries and aquaculture, shipping and shipbreaking coastal tourism, port development, and marine-based energy. To achieve a growth pattern that makes consumption more efficient, production more subtle, and interventions more mechanized, the intervention of technology in blue growth is essential. The existing sectors are utilizing technological innovation such as marine aquaculture, technologies for exploration and decommission of offshore oil and gas platforms, ballast wastewater management technologies, oil spill management technologies, digital navigation and sea traffic management, and biotechnology. The studies indicated that the presence of these technologies has a positive impact on growth of blue economy sectors. However, the South Asian region still lacks major breakthroughs in investment when it comes to technologies such as satellite sensors and imagery techniques for exploration and management, big data, information technologies, and digitalization for improving port services and advancement in biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies. For the successful utilization of oceanic resources while preserving the environment, the South Asian regions need technological advancement, innovation, collaboration, and integrated policy options. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

It is an innovative and intriguing idea for the blue economy sector. It brings the capacity to communicate with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sense, actuate, and transfer data to control centers at regular internet speeds with affordable technologies. The concept of IoUt has gained much importance since the Earth is covered with water, over 71% in the form of oceans, seas, canals, and rivers. Also, there is a huge number of unexploited resources that lie underwater. To support a wide range of applications that include real-time aquatic information, military applications, oil and gas exploration, water contamination, diver networks monitoring, early warning system, and smart ocean, the IoUT has evolved as a powerful technology.

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper provides a contribution of systematisation to the literature on the blue economy and aquaculture as challenging issues for achieving sustainable growth and a circular economy. The growing scientific interest in recent years and the increased attention in political agendas make the blue economy and aquaculture as promising fields for scientific investigation. The latter has been confirmed during a particular period too as the pandemic times. To identify those areas of specialisation emerging from the intersection of such topics, the paper embraces a systematic literature review for inspiring future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study covers a period of 20 years by including 85 papers extracted from the Scopus database. Through the adoption of VOSviewer, the investigation explores the main descriptive statistics, while content analysis has been embraced to identify thematic areas. Findings: The main results of this study are about statistics (i.e. publication trends, geographic distribution, most frequent keywords and most influential authors, etc.). Three main thematic areas have been identified in this study: SDGs and policies for sustainable development, food and energy, business models and managerial issues. Practical implications: Practical implications arise both for firms and policymakers. About the firsts, interesting insights can be derived in terms of business model innovation, collaborative approaches and technological exploration. About policymakers, inspiration in terms of renewal of strategic guidelines, creation of enabling contextual conditions and evidences for new regulations can be noted. Originality/value: Elements of original contributions can be identified in the adoption of an SLR to verify the advancement of the debate till the recent pandemic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Since then, various international bodies started promoting the concept to build up strategies for protecting and preserving priceless ocean resources. However, initially, this new term was often confusingly used to mean “ocean economy” or “marine economy.” To remove the ambiguity of these words, the UN in 2014 came up with an exclusive definition of blue economy. This chapter seeks to explore the challenges and opportunities of the blue economy. To identify the scope of the blue economy in line with the restoration and protection of ecosystem services and UN’s SDGs, this chapter provides some substantial evidence to increase the concept of ocean ecosystem services and reduce the anthropogenic impact on the ocean ecosystem. Finally, this chapter has given some suggestions and recommendations on the development and future directions of the blue economy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {The concept of the “blue economy” reflects the recognition of the exceptional role of the oceans and seas for the world community. The rapid degradation of aquatic ecosystems and the depletion of their resource base due to an increase in environmental and economic burden inevitably have an impact on the well-being and health of people living in coastal countries. With the increase in the scale of oceanic fishing, there was a growing understanding of the need to study and preserve the living resources of the oceans. This was facilitated by a number of objective factors and, above all, the desire of all States involved in the exploitation of aquatic biological resources to create conditions for the sustainable, maximum possible, rational use of these resources. In order to preserve living marine resources for most areas of the world Ocean, including in the Atlantic, international legal acts have been prepared and signed. As a result, international fishing organizations were created for almost every district: fishing commissions, scientific councils, scientific committees, etc. The main task for our country in the research and extraction of aquatic biological resources of the Atlantic Ocean in modern conditions is to protect the interests of optimal Russian fishing at the international level. This is possible by evaluating aquatic biological resources on a strict scientific basis and developing recommendations for their rational use, taking into account the Concept of the “blue economy”, the requirements of international conventions and bilateral treaties. In total, in the oceanic regions of the Atlantic, the domestic fleet can annually extract about 1.0 million tons of aquatic biological resources without damage to the oceanic ecosystem. In addition, it should be borne in mind that there is a promising reserve—possible fishing of Antarctic krill up to 5.5 million tons annually. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Once understood their major sources of income, especially in rural Asia, highly dependent on agriculture and fisheries, we examine (in this volume on Blue Economy) first the role of fisheries. We discuss the present state and future estimates that some modelling have shown, reflecting on the effects that this may have on those coastal, mostly rural areas mainly depending on them as source of protein and income. Secondly, we look in detail to particularly relevant areas of coastal economies, the deltas, as one of the most likely affected areas of global change. Based on several sources, mainly gridded or downscaled Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI) measures, we analyze different paths that some of the large deltas in Asia may encounter under different scenarios, often described globally, making use of existing downscaled data. We conclude that those areas tend to be relatively lower endowed than other areas (especially urban) to address futures, especially unsustainable, fragmented and unequal ones. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Through its work, the programme builds on earlier Irish seabed mapping efforts, including the Irish National Seabed Survey project in producing seabed mapping products that support Ireland’s blue economy, European marine policy and international efforts to understand our global oceans. INFOMAR uses a variety of marine technologies to deliver accurate bathymetric maps and useful data products to end users through a free and open source licensing agreement. To reflect the diversity of applications these data products serve, a series of four case studies are presented here focusing on marine geophysical and geological data from locations within Ireland’s marine territories. The case studies illustrate how data generated through seabed mapping may be interpreted to directly impact the generation of blue knowledge across a variety of marine environments ranging from shallow coastal and shelf waters to the deep oceanic depths of the continental slope of Ireland’s marine area. The impact of Ireland’s seabed mapping efforts is further considered in the context of national, European and international initiatives where Ireland’s marine knowledge resource is leveraged to deliver positive benefit to the programme’s stakeholders. © 2020 The Author(s).},

This work is timely, as Blue Economy activities account for a significant share of GDPs in the island and coastal economies in the Asia region, sustaining the livelihoods of one of the largest sections of the world’s population. This book, therefore, assesses how the Blue Economy contributes to these livelihoods from economic and ecological perspectives and analyzes the various types of ecosystem services provided, and how these services are regulated and maintained. While most studies of the Blue Economy focus only on the economic aspects, this book provides ample statistical data to demonstrate why ecosystem services should additionally be considered for the estimation and valuation of the Blue economy. The book is primarily meant for researchers, students, and teachers in the fields of environmental and ocean economics, sustainable development, and ecosystem services, and will be of further interest to policymakers and government officials working in matters related to the Blue Economy and sustainability policy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

It also draws attention to some key challenges affecting the long-term sustainability of the sector at both local and regional levels. In addressing the transition of the regional fisheries and aquaculture sector to the ‘blue economy’ and stressing the strategic significance of regional cooperation as a mechanism, the following strategic steps are proposed as the way forward: (a) organisational reform, (b) rule consistency (institutional synergy), (c) creating incentives for member-states, (d) strengthening organisational power and (e) creating public awareness and policy makers’ interest, among others. The principal message of this chapter is that under the ‘blue economy’ agenda ‘business as usual’ is not a rational option.

One aspect that is seldom discussed is the trade facilitation and liberalization that is achieved through its efficient implementation. In this chapter, we attempt to capture just that-the impact of global trade and its subsequent economic consequences in the blue economy. This would help in understanding whether the objectives of enhanced economic growth and employment opportunities can be obtained through trade liberalization. The paper studies this aspect using simulations of computational general equilibrium analysis. The results suggest that imports and overall welfare may increase due to the trade liberalization between IORA and non-IORA countries in the blue economy sectors. The economies act positively by increased access to global markets in order to utilize the abundantly available blue economy resources. Import expansion can be as high as half a percent of initial imports in some countries. Trade impact is much more visible in certain industrial sectors, than others. Therefore, it can be unequivocally stated that for the growth of the blue economy, trade liberalization measures may be undertaken for the promotion of economic growth and welfare of the region. With improved trade facilitation, countries will have an improved logistic performance score. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Efforts to encourage the sustainable use and protection of the ocean and its resources should therefore be an area of interest and competence for the regional group which seeks to engender cooperation in matters of economic and social development. This paper examines the regionally relevant institutional arrangements that frame and execute ocean development and governance within CARICOM. It finds that while some important sectors, such as fisheries and tourism, have specific organizations established geared toward regional coordination in management of those activities, others, including offshore oil and gas, marine scientific research, and port and shipping development, lack similar arrangements. Additionally, the CARICOM group lags in adopting a holistic, ecosystem approach to ocean management with siloed approaches dominating and few formal mechanisms for intersectoral coordination existing. This paper advocates for and proposes means toward increased integration at a regional level for the management and continued governance of the marine space, its associated resources and activities. It also seeks to encourage the participatory development of a regional blue economy policy framework and strategy which would outline, among other things, CARICOM’s ocean vision and development priorities. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {A major challenge for fisheries management lies in how to strike a balance between the livelihoods of fishermen and sustainable operation of the fishing industry under the impact of climate change. In the long term, important marine habitats need to be designated as marine protected areas and prevent destructive man-made activities through appropriate legislation and law enforcement to promote marine resource conservation and ecological protection. Furthermore, marine protected areas have been recognized as the simplest, cheapest and most effective way in which to restore fishery resources and protect marine biodiversity in the future. However, the competent authorities have been unable to achieve co-management of the environment and partnerships for many years, and continue to rely on extensive integration and collaboration between governments and non-governmental organizations or individuals due to implementation-related factors such as the island society, the multiple social relationships of fishermen or residents in fishing villages, the closely related place attachment, and general xenophobia. The National Penghu University of Science and Technology established marine protected area community patrols in 2018. The patrols not only protect marine resources but also allow community residents and fishermen to build consensus among communities and reduce class discrimination against fishermen, which is in line with the sustainable planning and management strategy in fisheries of the blue economy and with the spirit of sato-umi. Sato-umi is a coastal area where biological productivity and biodiversity has increased through human interaction. In this study, social network analysis was used to systematically analyze the process of stakeholder engagement in the co-management of conservation areas, link cross-domain recreational resources amongst fishing villages, and cultivate regional revitalization in fishing communities through the visualization of participants’ locations, interactions, and relative infiuence. © 2022 Institution for Marine and Island Cultures, Mokpo National University.},

	abstract = {A country's product portfolio can predict its subsequent development of diversification and economic growth patterns. However, how does the sustainable portfolio of blue products predict the development degree of the blue economy? Herein, we combine the methods of network science (i.e., the product space) and economic complexity (i.e., the product complexity and country complexity) to draw the world blue product space for 2017 and the evolution maps of blue product space between China and the U.S. from 1995 to 2015 and rank the 66 blue products and 235 countries and territories, respectively. We find that (i) high-income countries are the main exporters of more complex blue products, while low-income countries are the main exporters of less sophisticated blue products. We also find that (ii) the export shares of the more sophisticated blue products increase with the complexity of the blue economy, while the export shares of the less sophisticated blue products decrease with the complexity of the blue economy. Finally, we find that (iii) the diversity development level of the blue economy is directly proportional to income; that is, countries with higher income have a greater level of blue economic diversity, and vice versa. These findings show that network science and economic complexity obtain information about the development level of the blue economy, and they can be used as an additional policy analysis combination for measuring the extent of sustainable economic development in different countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

It was a limited study designed to summarize practical options for repurposing. The conclusions list those areas where further modeling or studies are warranted and required with the objective being to build an integrated modeling tool to assist companies, government agencies, and NGO's in assessing the benefits and risks for repurposing specific facilities. 30CFR 585J can be used to expedite permitting the deployment of renewable energy in the Gulf of Mexico. This regulation specifically is written to allow addition of renewable energy and other marine activities on to existing oil and gas leases and is written broadly enough it can be applied to other Blue Economy activities. For the transition to occur the current policy of removing non-producing assets must be stopped. These facilities, providing they are still in good repair, can be a tremendous asset that can accelerate the decarbonization of the Gulf Coast Region, and become the basis for an industrial transition that will create more employment and value than even the peak of offshore oil and gas. The Gulf of Mexico has an excellent offshore renewable energy potential. NREL places the total Gross Resource available at 2000GW and the Technical (recoverable) resource at 500GW. Neither value includes geothermal, and because of the conservative way the NREL calculates the resources the actual potential is at least twice as large. The DOE study, summarized in this paper, provides detailed answer to the following questions: • What is the potential value of legacy platforms, wells, and pipelines to renewable energy and Blue Economy activities? • What renewable energy systems are economically viable in the Gulf of Mexico and can be deployed safely on existing leases? • What Blue Economy industries can be facilitated by using legacy assets in the Gulf of Mexico? • Who can apply for and what is the process for repurposing existing assets or adding new assets to existing leases? • What are the benefits to the current owners, the Gulf Coast Region, and environment? Finally, the paper provides the outline of a process that stakeholders can use to evaluate individual existing facilities for potential use in building a Blue Industrial base in the Gulf of Mexico. © 2022, Offshore Technology Conference.

Marine biotechnology is more of a field that makes use of marine bioresources as the source of biological applications. The market-linked application of marine resource biotechnology has grown steadily over recent decades. For numerous commercialized products, the market exceeded several billion USD per annum by the year 2020, with a composite annual growth rate of 4-5%. Potential applications of biotechnology in marine environments include polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), microbiomes, and coatings. The growing focus on marine technology for the research and development of innovative drug has amplified the growth of the blue biotechnology market in the European region, whereas the market share in the Asia-Pacific region displays a substantial growth in this market, but blue biotechnology is not much used in various fields yet.

It recognizes the important role that oil and gas has played and continues to play in the economy of states in CARICOM, especially Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Guyana and Barbados. Renewable energy has a much greater potential for decentralized distribution and will fundamentally alter the relationship between energy producers and consumers and as such its geopolitical ramifications will become a key concern of global energy constituencies. Among the foreign policy tools that can be leveraged to support a country in managing the geopolitical consequences of an energy transition, diplomacy is key. The strategic importance of fostering bilateral or multilateral energy diplomacy with countries that can provide security of domestic energy supply, markets for the long-term monetisation of hydrocarbon resources, renewable energy and support for economic diversification is clear. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Catamaran tourism could be one of the most profitable civil industries in Bangladesh. As one of the world’s largest resource-based industry, it accounts for the world’s Gross Domestic Product and generate huge jobs in Bangladesh. The coastal and marine tourism and its associated resources such as forestry, fishing, in Cox’s Bazar, Kutubdia, Patuakhali and Moheshkhali could be emerged as a thriving and expanding industry. These places blessed with spectacular seascapes and beaches have significant and diverse natural, cultural, indigenous and heritage impacts that are easily and regularly accessed by residents and visitors. The growing recreational fishing could be developed as part of catamaran tourism in near shore and offshore of those areas. Again, Bangladesh can develop standard and advanced cruise shipping destinations in those areas enriched with coastal and marine tourism which is the main focus of this chapter. The emerging catamaran tourism in these areas may include a range of activities such as sea kayaking, whale watching, SCUBA diving, coastal sightseeing, beach walking, surfing, and touring as well as attractions, parks, accommodation, festivals and special events that have a marine theme or tourism experience. Significant problems lie in fundamental statistical gaps detailing the magnitude of coastal and marine tourism. Since the catamaran tourism may face the environmental challenges that are widely recognized, sustainable tourism should be reinforced to promote and protect “sustaining local economies, local cultures and local environments”. As a host community, Bangladesh can utilize her physical environment and social fabric for the regeneration and future productivity of natural resources, recognize the contribution that people and communities, customs and lifestyles make to the tourism experience. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

Significant portion of the world’s population relies on the marine resources for their livelihood. Prediction of sea surface temperature (SST) has many applications in the field of forecasting ocean weather and climate, fishing zones identification, over exploitation of ocean environment and also strategic sectors like defence. Over the years, many approaches based on dynamic models and statistical models have been attempted to predict sea surface temperature. Generally, dynamic models are compute and time-intensive. On the other hand, as statistical approaches are lightweight, sometimes they may fail to model complex problems. Recently, considerable success of artificial intelligence in many applications, especially deep learning (DL) technique, motivates us to apply the same for prediction of sea surface temperature. We have built an attention-based ensemble model over a set of basic models based on different DL techniques that consume uniquely prepared variant datasets to produce better predictions.

	abstract = {Colombia has a diverse range of marine ecosystems in the coastal and insular areas of the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Seaweed research has focused mainly on the identification and taxonomic distribution of 628 species identified so far, mainly in the Caribbean Sea. Among the most widely cultivated genera of seaweeds in open-sea pilot systems in Colombia are Hydropuntia, Gracilaria, Hypnea, Kappaphycus, and Eucheuma. These genera have shown low yields as a consequence of high tissue fragility, epiphytism, sedimentation, and nitrogen deficiency. In addition, the evaluation of the biological activity of selected seaweed compounds has advanced considerably, focusing on their composition and their use for direct consumption by humans and animals. Despite the diversity of seaweeds, as well as certain technical and scientific advances, Colombia is still lagging behind other countries in seaweed exploitation, both in Latin America and worldwide. This current status raises the need to increase research, technological (agro-tech) appropriation, and the adoption of effective public policies that will boost algal businesses. In addition, seaweed cultivation could support the current blue economy transition in Colombia, which could eventually allow the country to enter the global seaweed market. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Ocean decision-makers are tasked with balancing social, economic, and environmental considerations when addressing complex policy challenges and achieving strategic objectives, such as conservation targets, or sustainable and ocean-based economic development agendas. Like many common environmental assets, oceans have been impacted by a history of imperfect governance resulting in substantial negative consequences for these important socio-ecological systems. Aligning and managing multiple trade-offs between policy targets for the management of human activities in the marine domain has been increasingly attempted using Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). More recently, Ocean Accounting (OA) has appeared as a framework that extends national, environmental, and ecosystem accounting, and provides a structure to integrate the information describing ocean ecosystems and their changing relationships with society and the economy. Globally, MSP is therefore employed to prioritise actions towards strategic objectives, while OA is being developed to centralise, standardise, and integrate ocean information. As awareness of human dependence on healthy ocean ecosystems has increased, the use of both MSP and OA has grown rapidly across the world, and intersections between the two frameworks, both geographically and theoretically are emerging. To inform both MSP and OA communities of practice, this paper explores their role in strategic ocean governance, and how synergies may be enhanced to further an understanding of complex ocean systems. Thoughtfully aligned, the two frameworks might work together with OA providing dynamic inputs to an adaptive MSP process. The early recognition of synergies between the two frameworks, and their potential for co-development, is considered imperative to advance effective ocean governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biorefineries can operate from microalgae biomass, producing biofuels and value-added products such as carbohydrates, pigments (chlorophyll, carotenoids, and astaxanthin), oils, and proteins, with low environmental impact techniques and the possibility of applying the blue economy. Thus, microalgae have great potential due to their energy content, high growth rate, short harvest cycle, and remarkable carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation capacity. However, using this microorganism on a large scale is expensive, especially in the cultivation stage. Thus, nanoparticles have been evaluated as a promising alternative to assist in the cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, offering solutions for different stages of the processes. Furthermore, nanomaterials contribute to the economic viability and processing efficiency of microalgae-based products that can be essential in mitigating or preventing adverse environmental impacts. In this context, this review addresses the contribution of microalgae biotechnology using nanostructures for biorefinery systems. Moreover, this article demonstrates nanoparticles and nanofibers’ benefits for biorefineries and their potential application to the blue economy concept.

Ocean current energy is the kinetic energy of seawater flow, mainly from the more stable flow in submarine waterways and straits and from the regular flow of seawater due to tides, and is another form of ocean energy that takes the form of kinetic energy. This paper develops a kind of distributed sea current energy turbine power generation equipment based on hydraulic energy transfer, through the design and optimization of the turbine structure, the simulation analysis of the hydraulic system, the design of low-flow sea current energy hydraulic transfer control power generation equipment, and the towing experiment in the towing pool. At a water flow rate of 0.3 m/s, the turbine generates 332.8 W at design operating conditions, with a power factor of 0.44 and an optimum blade tip speed ratio of approximately 6.5. The research in this paper provides the basis for the efficient exploitation of low-flow ocean current energy, which has important military applications and great potential for commercial exploitation. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blue carbon means the organic form of carbon locked in the marine ecosystems, and the major repositories of such carbon are the mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes throughout the world. Pieces of evidence show that these ecosystems can store substantial quantities of carbon and have the potential to offset the anthropogenic carbon emissions. All three conventional blue carbon ecosystems are present in India’s coastal periphery. This chapter collated the observations related to carbon stock in the various compartments of these ecosystems. We discussed the measurement protocols and the present knowledge acquired so far about the carbon sequestration potential of these ecosystems in India. The blue economy is an emerging discipline, and inclusion of the blue carbon ecosystem services within the arena of the blue economy is an essential endeavor that needs special attention from the perspective of India. This chapter also discussed the findings of the very few studies, which dealt with estimating the monetary worth of the carbon locked in some of the blue carbon ecosystems. Scrutinizing all the observations, we have delineated the major lacuna of this domain that needs special attention shortly. The authors intend to make this chapter a thought-provoking piece for other researchers to nurture innovative ideas to link blue carbon science and economics. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Many coastal nations have embraced marine spatial planning (MSP) as a solution to maintaining ecological integrity of marine environments, while ensuring continued provisioning of economic, social, and cultural benefits. However, evidence supporting the idea that plans achieve-or are likely to achieve-these goals is limited. One gap in our understanding stems from questions surrounding the metrics against which MSP success is measured. Evaluation can be based on explicitly stated objectives, or might include metrics corresponding to broad social-ecological goals. This paper compares aspirational MSP goals gleaned from a literature review to the objectives extracted from 50+ finalized and implemented plans to better understand: (1) how well these two groupings align, and (2) in what ways any misalignment may shape MSP evaluation. Findings show that plans prioritize the environment, economy, and governance, while often excluding objectives related to cultural heritage, human well-being, Indigenous rights, human safety, and climate change. Social and cultural objectives have become more prevalent over time, yet overall stated objectives remain distinct from theorized MSP goals. As international efforts aim to expand MSP, narrowing the gap between how it is perceived and how its outcomes are evaluated is critical to better understanding what it is likely to achieve.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.
