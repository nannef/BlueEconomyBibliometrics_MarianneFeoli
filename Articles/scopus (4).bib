We use the time series data which covers the period from 1990 to 2019. For empirical estimations, we use nonlinear ARDL approach which confirms that energy indicators and blue economic indicators are not mature enough to achieve carbon neutrality objectives. However, after Vision 2030 empirics, positive shocks in green indicators are turning down the carbon level. The findings of energy and blue indicators are useful for policy recommendations which help to achieve the sustainable environmental goals of Vision 2030. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {To support sustainable growth of ocean-based economies, many countries are engaging in marine spatial planning (MSP) processes, which require robust decision-support tools. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is commonly used in decision-making to guide spatially efficient protected area expansion. Here we contend that SCP can also be used to streamline MSP negotiations by developing a coherent, integrated portfolio of sites for multiple sectors that depend on biodiversity being maintained in a good state, as a counterpoint to spatial priorities for those commercial and industrial activities that have negative environmental impacts. We demonstrate this in Algoa Bay, South Africa, given the social-ecological complexity of the bay, and its central location in the first national MSP process. In anticipation of this national process, a civil-society-led Community of Practice was established with a core team to lead stakeholder engagement, data acquisition and management, and SCP analyses. More than 500 stakeholders participated in the project and many contributed spatial data or engaged in expert-based participatory mapping. Spatial products were supplemented with existing, published datasets. Altogether, conservation targets were set for 115 biodiversity features and 22 nature-based activities, with the cost layer built from data on 10 commercial and industrial activities, cumulative pressures (n = 31) on ecosystems, and planning-unit area. All targets were met in 15% of the study area, of which only a third (4%) was outside of marine protected areas, demonstrating that it is possible to align multi-sector priorities for intact biodiversity. This approach can be widely applied in MSP to support sustainable ocean economies. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The “blue carbon” concept and the role of blue carbon stored in shallow coastal ecosystems in mitigating climate change have attracted attention worldwide. In addition to typical blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds and macroalgae farming are also gaining recognition as potential blue carbon sinks. Effective policies and methodologies are important for the conservation and expansion of blue carbon sinks, as well as the consequent reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). One of the most effective methods is carbon offset credit schemes. However, to date, almost all credit schemes have been implemented for mangroves and saltmarshes. None has been implemented for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming, although their CO2 uptake potentials are large. Here, we review three blue carbon offset credit projects for seagrass meadows, macroalgal beds, and macroalgae farming implemented in Japan. We show the blue carbon offset crediting projects of (1) Yokohama City, the first in the world; (2) Fukuoka City, the second such project in Japan; and (3) the first Japanese national governmental demonstration project. Furthermore, we highlight their characteristics by comparing them with the other blue carbon offset projects. Finally, we discuss the need to accelerate blue carbon offset credit projects and related initiatives in the future. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations ranks India at 13th position with 5300 wet tones of seaweed harvest (0.2% of global production). The domestic micro or medium enterprises still overwhelmingly rely on wild harvest for feedstock. The production of hydrocolloids and bio stimulants for agriculture has been the main product portfolio for the last several decades. Nevertheless, with 7516.6 km of coastline, this sector holds enormous promise for sustainable economic development. The strong “Innovation Quotient” proved to be the crucial driving force to develop several novel products backed up with intellectual property rights. Appreciable steps have been taken by the Union Government of India to give further fillip to the marine sector through different forums to achieve a sustainable and circular Blue Economy. The purpose of this thematic article is to collate the state-of-the-art information on the cultivation and processing sector in the country, and to provide recommendations for evidence-based sector management and policy decision making. The proposal of establishing a “Multipurpose Seaweed Park”—the first of its kind in the world—in Tamil Nadu is a very pertinent first step towards the cause of modernizing and improving the domestic industries, adopting improved processing and sustainable and green technologies. The analysis revealed that in order to fulfill these objectives, more coordinated efforts of several stakeholders are necessary, along with the cooperation of different government departments and industry participation. The lessons learned would help in furthering our collaboration with countries of the Indian Ocean region and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, for mutual benefit. © 2022 by the authors.},

We assessed the alternatives against technological aspects, environmental aspects, and site-selection factors through the development of a Bayesian network and an influence diagram such that the uncertainties of each possible vector of consequences were effectively assessed for each alternative. We structured the consequence space as a three-level hierarchical tree and constructed the multi-attribute utility function under various independence conditions. We described in detail the assessment of the scaling constants in the multi-attribute utility function. The analysed alternatives were ranked based on the maximum expected utility rule to outline the best one. We performed one-dimensional and multi-dimensional sensitivity analyses, to test how the solution is impacted by the subjectively assessed five-dimensional utility function and showed that the constructed function is rather robust within a very wide range of values. Finally, we outlined some future aspects of development and implementation for the Bayesian-network-influence diagram based multi-attribute analysis as a decision-support system tool for offshore Blue Growth projects with different types of production systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Seaweed is often touted as a blue economy resource with climate benefits. Several calls are made to scale the industry up and to use blue carbon financing to create additional incentives for the sector to expand. But how much of a climate crisis panacea is seaweed, and under which conditions can climate benefits be realized? The article reviews the literature on climate impacts from seaweed value chains and proposes a cradle-to-grave structure for carbon accounting in seaweed value chains. While the literature points towards several ways in which climate benefits can be generated, the evidence base for net negative emissions across the value chain is not robust enough to suggest seaweed value chains, by default, are a climate solution. Instead, climate effects depend on the specific production setup, product choice and the fate of the product on the market. Climate benefits can only be claimed by tracking blue carbon flows across whole life cycles and over time. Knowledge gaps relate to effects at sea, the role of temporarily locking carbon into products and the effects of introducing this resource to the market. Blue carbon financing should be directed only to setups proven to lead to additional and permanent carbon storage. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria have been, in the last decades, greatly attractive to the market as a source of natural compounds, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and secondary metabolites. Such compounds have been used in several industries from low-to high-value-such as food, feed, nutraceutical, and cosmetics-mainly due to their unique chemical properties and bioactive potential. Despite their great potential for biotechnological propose, the use of these organisms is still limited to process viability. Only Arthrospira spp. (Spirulina) has been successfully applied in the market worldwide. The current implementation of cyanobacteria-based bioprocesses is constrained by poor volumetric efficiency, leading to excessively high costs. Technological improvements of such processes are thus critical and will require multiple approaches at production, extraction, and purification levels. In recent years, several strategies and optimization processes have been suggested by several studies, which have provided promising prospects for the use of cyanobacteria and for the establishment of a sustainable bioprocess. Thus, this chapter will cover the main aspects of a cyanobacteria-based bioprocess, from the strain selection, production, harvesting, drying, extraction and purification of targeted compounds and further potential applications of cyanobacteria-based products, highlighting the most promising strategies of optimization. © 2022 By Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {During the last decade, growing demand has prevailed for environmental protection and the application of sustainability principles toward the coastal environment. As the coastal zone constitutes one of the first recipients of the impacts of climate change due to the rise in sea level, integrated coastal zone management arises as a significant tool for the study of vulnerable coastal ecosystems. In combination with ICZM, the use of indicators and ecosystem services analysis couples all of the information, leading to an integrated approach and opportunities for a sustainable blue economy in coastal ecosystems. The aim of the present study is to form a protocol for a sustainable blue economy in the coastal zone, which will investigate and define the current capacity and the boundaries of a coastal ecosystem with specific characteristics of industrial activity, cultural heritage, and a protected natural environment. The case study for this research is the Gulf of Elefsis, a special sea basin in the eastern Mediterranean, located a short distance from the Athens metropolitan area. The Gulf of Elefsis is characterized by a developed coastal zone, which includes intense industrial activity, the ancient historical sights of Elefsis, the environmentally protected wetland of lake Koumoundourou, the town of Elefsis, a trade port, and growing shipbuilding activity. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The ‘Blue Economy’ is often framed as a revolutionary and transformative approach to marine and fishery development. However, scholars increasingly critique the Blue Economy in hopes that equity-related concerns can become more prevalent. While these efforts are important, historical materialist perspectives can more deeply challenge the assumptions and limits of economistic thinking. In that vein, Racial Capitalism posits that capitalist markets promote, solidify and rely on racial hierarchy to secure differential value accumulation. This study applies a Racial Capitalist analysis to illustrate how the expansion of capitalist social relations corresponded the re-solidification of white supremacy to (re)produce systemic inequality in Black maritime labour, and specifically fisheries labour, on the U.S. eastern seaboard. In this case, which occurred across several states and in a critically important marine-fishery system, the expansion of market relations corresponded with labour exploitation, naturalization of hierarchy and inequitable distribution of socioeconomic harm for Black workers. I identify three lessons from this case that Blue Economy and fisheries scholars should heed; specifically, be wary of market utopianism, technological innovation is not inherently progressive, and systemic exploitation still matters. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The recent return of Atlantic bluefin tuna to northern Europe following the recovery of the east Atlantic stock has sparked substantial public and scientific interest. This is particularly true for recreational anglers in Denmark, who often consider Atlantic bluefin tuna to be the catch of a lifetime. This attitude has previously sustained a substantial recreational fishery for bluefin tuna with annual tournaments in Denmark, which peaked in the 1950s before the subsequent collapse of the stock during the 1960s. Several scientific tagging programs have recruited recreational anglers in recent years to help catch and release tagged bluefin tuna. The anglers’ investment of time and money in the scientific tagging projects indicate that the recreational fishery could recover in the future. However, the economic aspects of a potential future recreational bluefin tuna fishery remain unknown. We surveyed anglers participating in a scientific catch and release bluefin tuna fishery in Denmark across three years (2018–2020) and calculated the total annual expenditures associated with the activities. Additionally, we estimated the magnitude of the negative impact (i.e., incidental mortalities) on the bluefin tuna stock. Our results show that total annual expenditures by the recreational anglers approached 1,439,540€, totaling 4,318,620€ between 2018 and 2020. We found that recreational bluefin tuna anglers had mean annual expenditures directly related to the bluefin tuna fishing between 7,047€ and 2,176€ with an associated mortality impact on the stock of less than 1 tonne annually. By comparing the mortality impact to the expenditures, we estimate that each dead Atlantic bluefin tuna during the three study years generated 398,163€ in mean annual expenditures, equivalent to approximately 1636€ kg-1. Our study demonstrates significant economic expenditures among recreational anglers who target Atlantic bluefin tuna. This provides a clear example of how a recovery of marine natural capital and related ecosystem services can support development in the blue economy. © 2022 Maar et al.

	abstract = {The vulnerability of coastal and marine ecosystems provides strong arguments for the adoption of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) which incorporates both human and ecosystem well-being with good governance practice. The objective of this study is to investigate the present status, future potentials for the development of a framework of the EAFM for the sustainable coastal and marine resource development of Bangladesh. Using both primary and secondary sources of information, this study has found that some levels of EAFM are already in practice to some extent in some specific coastal river ecosystems along the hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) sanctuaries for the protection of juvenile and brood hilsa, but often not implemented and managed in an appropriate planned and objective way. There are some signs of ecosystem well-being for a few fisheries but some levels of deterioration of the ecosystem have been noticed as well. It is unclear how this ecosystem well-being in one hand and its continued interruption and deterioration in another hand interact and affect human well-being for making a resilient society in the fishing communities. The EAFM has great potential to improve both the ecosystem and human well-being in the coming years as well as to contribute to the blue economy and achieve some SDG targets. However, how the ecosystem's well-being will be translated into social well-being will depend on the efficiency of governance, particularly maintaining inclusiveness and equitable benefit sharing among resource users. © 2022},

	abstract = {The wide application of microalgae in health foods, nutritional feeds, aquaculture, pharmaceutical extracts, and biofuel production, has brought about the advancement of the microalgae cultivation industry. However, commercial-scale cultivation of microalgae still faces one major challenge, which is its economic feasibility, with lower cost and energy consumption. Developing floating photobioreactors to be utilized in offshore open water areas has gained more interest recently as it can diminish the cost effects of onshore land utilization, while seeking for additional benefits, such as regulated temperature, proximity to sunlight and nutrient supplies, and integrated ocean renewable energy. Thereby, this is timely to explore the potential of floating photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation in the offshore region. This review deliberately presents the characteristics of offshore environments and their potential effects on microalgae cultivation, as factors such as location selection, heat capacity, and utilization of cultivation resources are significantly different from conventional land-based cultivation. Compared to land-based photobioreactors, the design of floating photobioreactors has the opportunity to adopt hydrodynamical design; by utilizing the external force from ocean waves to generate internal liquid sloshing for improving the mixing of cultivation medium. While offshore-based microalgae cultivation is considerably new as part of blue economy and mariculture, this review provides insights into the opportunities for further advancement of offshore microalgae cultivation technologies. The encouraging factors for hybridization of offshore microalgae cultivation include mariculture, carbon dioxide capture and utilization, hydrogen production, and ocean thermal energy. Such understandings are vital to improving microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactors towards a valuable alternative to the current concerns in developing commercial scale of the microalgae industry. Various challenges in biological issues, economic and environmental challenges, installation and maintenance, as well as destructive hydrodynamic loads are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Islands are vulnerable to climate change because of their isolated geography, large coastal areas, and low economic diversification. This paper presents a model-based evaluation of the macroeconomic impacts of climate change on the Blue Economy of southern European islands. We consider climate change impact chains on tourism, maritime transport, and electricity demand in a downscaled modeling framework for different climatic scenarios to the end of the century. Our findings show important economic losses in all climatic scenarios, yet economic damages under an RCP8.5 scenario more than doubled compared to a RCP2.6 pathway. Magnitudes of impacts vary across islands, depending on the level of economic diversification and geographic remoteness. The effects of climate change on the tourism sector are detrimental to the islandic economies, given the sector’s complex value chain and dominant position in value added. Similarly, increasing electricity demand for cooling and water desalination puts additional stress on the economy of the islands. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {California consumes the most seafood of all the states in the United States, and is thus an important influence on the national seafood landscape. Like the nation as a whole, California relies on trade for seafood, which can have effects on livelihoods, food security, human rights and environmental justice. Expanding aquaculture could contribute to food supply and security and provide a more sustainable way to produce food in the future. The United States has recently expressed an interest in increasing domestic production of seafood, in the Executive Order Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth, with the direct desired results of increased local and sustainable food, decreased foreign dependence, and increased jobs. California is re-examining its seafood sector and needs to reconcile disparities in production and consumption as the state navigates a changing seafood landscape. Understanding the current seafood landscape is necessary for making informed decisions to secure a resilient, sustainable, and equitable seafood sector. To reflect the goals recently stated in the Executive Order, we ask 1) what is the state of seafood production and consumption in California, 2) what is the trade landscape for seafood within California, both domestic and international, and 3) how have people in California experienced this interaction between production, trade, and consumption, through the lens of employment. We find California consumes upward of three times more seafood than it produces by volume, and relies heavily on international imports to make up the production gap, with roughly half of imported production likely coming from aquaculture. This reliance has radiating effects, such as displacement of environmental burden to other, often poorer and less regulated countries, and to places where seafood production is likely associated with human rights violations. Wild capture is unlikely to increase, so any increase in domestic production will come from aquaculture. To meet this call, California has a choice along a spectrum of increased state production via aquaculture or increased dependence on aquacultured imports, both foreign and domestic. Currently, the state has the capacity to be proactive rather than reactive as it charts a path forward. © 2022},

	abstract = {Blue Economy is seen as an essential contributor to a sustainable development, and it is an important part of the EU Green Deal. Seaweed plays a key role in the Blue Economy as a source of food, feed, and feedstock for biorefineries. Today, the largest part of global seaweed production is based in Asia, but there is also a growing interest in seaweed production in Europe. However, more knowledge on the environmental impacts is needed to ensure sustainable growth of the sector. Seaweed can be used in biorefineries to produce a variety of products for food and non-food applications. The aim of this paper was to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a seaweed value-chain, including seaweed cultivation and production into sodium alginate, biodegradable materials, biogas, and fertilizer in a biorefinery setting. The LCA included 19 environmental impact categories but focused on climate change. The seaweed Saccharina latissima was cultivated and processed in Ireland. Sodium alginate was then extracted by means of ultrasound-assisted extraction, a novel extraction technology. Cellulosic residues produced after the extraction were used for the production of films used as a packaging material. Residues that remain after the production of the films were sent to anaerobic digestion to achieve a no-waste concept. For seaweed cultivation, fuel use and drying of seaweed biomass were the main environmental hot spots; and for the alginate extraction process, the yield and purification after extraction were the main hot spots. Overall, the results of this paper showed that the seaweed-based biorefinery has the potential to be sustainable, but several improvements are necessary before it is competitive with land-based systems. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The marine and coastal resources of the West Africa region contribute immensely to the global economy as well as to the economies of countries in the region. The region boasts of two vibrant Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs), namely the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) and the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem (GCLME), which provide vast fisheries and other marine resources. The region and its marine and coastal resources are however faced with diverse threats such as climate change, destruction of mangroves, overfishing, habitat destruction and coastal erosion, among many others. Several initiatives have been developed to address these challenges. This paper reviews some of the past as well as ongoing initiatives that address the challenges in the marine and coastal environment of West Africa. Among these initiatives is the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and Africa programme which uses Earth Observation (EO) data and derived information to manage marine and coastal resources, with focus on the “Marine and Coastal Areas Management in western Africa” theme implemented by the University of Ghana (UG). The Regional Marine Centre (RMC) at the University of Ghana, which serves as the Regional Implementation Centre for the GMES and Africa marine programme for West Africa, uses sentinel-1 satellite data to monitor shoreline change. This information is combined with other datasets to generate coastal vulnerability indices (CVI) map for erosion hotspots in the region, which directly feeds into policy initiatives towards addressing the problem of coastal erosion in the region. This, as a result, contributes to building coastal resilience and alleviating the severe impacts of climate change on the West Africa coast, and contributing to the Blue Economy agenda. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Blue economy projects are typically financed through conventional means of public and development finance. However, the nature and characteristics of blue economy projects transcend the need to extend beyond the conventional financing options of multilateral/bilateral aid. The objective of this article is to assess if the existing blue economy initiatives are adequate to the sectoral investment needs and to develop contours of a framework that could accelerate the blue economy investments. The research finds that the current initiatives such as blue bonds are relatively small and accelerating investments requires access to additional financing instruments and a transformative change in participating stakeholders. Using a Theory of Change approach, contours of a framework that pools in low-cost funds from a diverse set of investors to be deployed for either public sector promoted large impact projects or individual blue economy projects through market-based instruments are suggested. The findings contribute to the ongoing debate on how to improve the financial capability of various blue economy stakeholders and enable them to configure more sustainable financing mechanisms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recently, the rights of small-scale fishers have increasingly been acknowledged in ocean governance because coastal development and various maritime activities have reduced traditional fishing grounds. More specifically, small-scale fisheries (SSF) are increasingly being threatened by ocean grabbing, pollution, and a lack of inclusiveness in decision-making processes. Although there are guidelines to resolve and reduce conflict, formal avenues to include fisher concerns, particularly in the context of ocean development and governance, remain a difficult task. Moreover, there is insufficient information on how fishers are impacted by coastal and marine development and how their concerns are included in the decision-making process. Hence, this study contributes to the SSF discourse by understanding and describing the characteristics and concerns of small-scale fishers from two coastal towns in East Africa with different levels of port development. Using data from perception surveys, focus group discussions, and participatory mapping, we discuss how fishers were involved in the decision-making processes to develop ports in Lamu, Kenya, and Bagamoyo, Tanzania. We found that fishers rely on nearshore ecosystems such as mangroves and coral reefs because of their accessibility since most fishers only use low-powered boats for fishing. Moreover, we found that the fishers’ livelihoods were severely affected by port development and that they were excluded from the decision-making process concerning the port’s construction and fishers’ compensations. While some fishers believe that new ports in the region can increase their livelihoods by creating new markets and jobs, this is unlikely to happen since most fishers are not qualified to work in formal port-related jobs. We propose three steps that will allow fishermen to participate in port development decision-making processes and contribute to the development of a sustainable SSF. These include improving engagement with fishers to allow meaningful participation in decision-making, developing a blue economy policy focused on SSF, and implementing maritime spatial planning.

Not only will it represent a new income and employment generating activity, but it will also contribute to national food security. Mauritius has a seaweeds diversity of 435 species and probably more given the low research on seaweeds. The island hosts a significant density of certain important species for potential commercialization for both local and international markets. Yet, no seaweeds industries have been able to establish in Mauritius so far. The valorization and prioritization of seaweeds industries is crucial for Mauritius economy to flourish as this typical natural resource can be sustainably exploited in Mauritius. There is an imperative need to perform an in-depth investigation of the various seaweeds culture, abundance, and potential for commercialization into various products. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Evidence-based identification of the nature and cause of threats to marine ecosystems is the essential first step in effective ocean management. Action that targets each threat across as much as possible of the area in which it arises, which may be entirely different from where it manifests, is the second. These concepts are not new, however, The High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (HLOP) has given them increased impetus by mandating that its signatories, in addressing priority marine issues, which may vary from country to country and collectively be of global importance, must begin with addressing threats in 100% of national waters. The successful management of the world's biggest tuna resources across 50 million km2 of the Central and Western Pacific is put forward as an example of how an initial commitment to a single shared fisheries resource assessment program can provide the foundation for consensus amongst more than 40 countries on the sharing of the benefits of managed access to widespread oceanic resources.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Global obligations to achieve sustainable oceans by 2030 require countries to commit to solutions that balance ocean use and protection. To do so necessitates baseline understanding of the ocean’s contribution to socio-economic well-being, which we do by measuring the economic activity of ocean-related sectors. Economic assessments tend to be data intensive and are typically reliant on professional economists, yet they are increasingly relevant to non-economists who engage in ocean management and communication, where they are integral in facilitating trade-off analysis of future ocean change. Thus, there is a need to make ocean economic assessment more accessible to nonspecialists. We fill this need by providing a pragmatic framework for conducting an economic assessment using British Columbia’s ocean sector as a case study. Our results show the impact of the province’s ocean sectors on four economic indicators and indicate that the ocean contributed almost $5 billion (or about 2%) to provincial gross domestic product (GDP) and generated about 106,120 jobs (over 4% of the province’s total) in 2015. Of these, the marine transport sector made the highest overall contribution followed by cruise lines, with GDP impacts of 66% and 13%, respectively. It should be noted that this estimated economic value is not representative of the full value of the ocean as it excludes oil and gas, research and education, and other activities that do not meet our criteria for inclusion, and it does not account for cultural and ecological values. Nonetheless the study highlights the substantial number of economic benefits generated by the blue economy. More significantly, the framework provides a simplified procedure for quantifying economic benefits, and can be applied by nonspecialists to perform rapid economic assessments in a variety of contexts. © 2022 by the authors.},

According to this aim, the study used two efficiency methods: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Free Disposal Hull (FDH). A total of 29 tourism centres were selected to conduct the DEA and FDH methods. These efficiency methods (DEA-FDH) used inputs and outputs variables to estimate the efficiency of the tourism centres. The selected inputs were the length of the shoreline (km), area (ha), tourism investments (million EGP), quality of coral reefs, numbers of hotels, and tourism accommodation capacity. While the outputs were employees’ number and tourists’ number. The results indicate that, generally, the tourism centres in the Southern Red Sea region of Egypt showed high-efficiency scores, which reflects their good preparedness to implement the various coastal tourism development strategies from the blue economy perspective. The tourism centres in the Safaga-Quseir tourism sector were the most efficient ones, regardless of the efficiency models used. While the tourist centres representing the Ras Banas tourism sector were the least efficient centres in the whole sample (29 tourism centres). Copyright: © 2022 Kabil et al.

	abstract = {For the maritime sector to be sustainable and to have an intact blue economy, shipowners should be ready to implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans alongside energy efficiency projects. The problem for organizations and shipowners having fishing carriers older than 20 years is highlighted and the following challenges arise for decision-making authorities. To keep such ships in the fleet for the next decade, shipowners should deploy energy efficiency projects for marine system retrofitting to improve energy efficiency and meet environmental regulations. An energy audit is performed and an energy efficiency program is proposed with guidelines for regulations that are currently coming into force. To improve energy efficiency, reduce the environmental impact, and cut fuel consumption costs, marine system retrofitting is done, in a particular case, with two options proposed. The first is a cascade refrigeration system with hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, where the shipowner gains an energy efficiency improvement of about 20%. The second option is a two-stage refrigeration system with ammonium as the environmentally friendly refrigerant, which improves the energy efficiency by about 26%. Technical and economic issues have been discussed.  © 2022 Viktor Yalama et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {The source of lighting in ships can be sourced from electrical energy generated by using generators or now can utilize new renewable energy, such as solar energy using PV. Based on the existing potential, Indonesia has good solar energy potential. The measurement results show that the potential for solar energy reaches 6.37 kWh/m2/day. This potential can certainly be utilized in the marine and fisheries world. The utilization of PV as a source of electrical energy on fishing boats is expected to help support government policies in terms of the blue economy and overcome the limited number of fossil energy sources. In this study, the installation of PV with a size of 100 WP was installed on fishing boats. The need for electrical energy for PV energy output shows that it can meet 50.52% of electrical energy needs. This result is supported by the Wilcoxon test that electrical energy needs can be met by PV with a p < 0.005. The results of the economic analysis also show that the use of solar energy as a source of electrical energy provides an IRR of 9%, with a payback period of 8.87 years. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {The Joint Task Force, Science Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications (JTF SMART) Subsea Cables, is working to integrate environmental sensors for ocean bottom temperature, pressure, and seismic acceleration into submarine telecommunications cables. The purpose of SMART Cables is to support climate and ocean observation, sea level monitoring, observations of Earth structure, and tsunami and earthquake early warning and disaster risk reduction, including hazard quantification. Recent advances include regional SMART pilot systems that are the first steps to trans-ocean and global implementation. Examples of pilots include: InSEA wet demonstration project off Sicily at the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water column Observatory Western Ionian Facility; New Caledonia and Vanuatu; French Polynesia Natitua South system connecting Tahiti to Tubaui to the south; Indonesia starting with short pilot systems working toward systems for the Sumatra-Java megathrust zone; and the CAM-2 ring system connecting Lisbon, Azores, and Madeira. This paper describes observing system simulations for these and other regions. Funding reflects a blend of government, development bank, philanthropic foundation, and commercial contributions. In addition to notable scientific and societal benefits, the telecommunications enterprise’s mission of global connectivity will benefit directly, as environmental awareness improves both the integrity of individual cable systems as well as the resilience of the overall global communications network. SMART cables support the outcomes of a predicted, safe, and transparent ocean as envisioned by the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and the Blue Economy. As a continuation of the OceanObs’19 conference and community white paper (Howe et al., 2019, doi: 10.3389/fmars.2019.00424), an overview of the SMART programme and a description of the status of ongoing projects are given.

At the core of the blue economy framework stands the incorporation of ocean values and services into economic modeling and governance. Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture are thus significant in this endeavor, particularly for Arctic nations, the economies of which are predominantly based on seafood production. Yet, while focus is increasingly placed on sustainability and blue economy models among Arctic states, the need for structured transnational collaboration is not always acknowledged. In that respect, this article aims to articulate a comparative study of the status quo, challenges, and opportunities of fisheries and aquaculture in Alaska and northern Norway and seeks to explore potentials for cross-sectoral synergies between the two regions in the context of the blue economy. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper introduces two innovative elements that are co-designed to extract the maximum power from; i) individual WEC buoys with a multi-resonance controller design and ii) synchronized with power packet network phase control through the physical placement of the WEC arrays reducing ESS requirements. MATLAB/Simulink models were created for the WEC array dynamics and control systems with Bretschneider irregular wave spectrum as inputs. The numerical simulation results show that for ideal physical WEC buoy array phasing of 60 degrees the ESS peak power and energy capacity requirements are minimized while the multi-resonant controllers optimize EPG power output for each WEC buoy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

	abstract = {Atlantic salmon (Salmon salar) aquaculture has been fully developed on a large scale worldwide. Currently in the Atlantic salmon processing industry, 40–50% of the fish body ends up as by-products, which contain a variety of nutrients and are mainly processed into functional ingredients for premium pet food and animal feed. With the global increase of interest in nutritional diets and supplements, more research has been performed for the valorization of salmon by-products into value-added food products for human consumption. In the present study, an immobilized protease was used for hydrolysis of Atlantic salmon by-products to extract salmon oil. Alcalase was immobilized on chitosan-coated iron (II, III) oxide nanoparticles via glutaraldehyde crosslinking. The immobilized Alcalase was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope. The optimum pH and temperature range for the immobilized Alcalase were determined as 8 and 55–65 °C, respectively. The salmon oil extraction process using the immobilized Alcalase was optimized through a factorial design, and the highest oil yield of 20.55% (88.30% recovery) was obtained from 1 h of hydrolysis at 65 °C. The oil recovery using the immobilized Alcalase was comparable to the use of free Alcalase. The low levels of oxidation and hydrolysis indicated the high quality of the extracted oil, which is promising to be processed into high-value products such as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. The immobilized Alcalase was collected using a magnet and reused at least three batches without a significant decrease in oil yield, indicating its potential for effective and consecutive oil extraction from salmon by-products. The present study would promote the production of value chain products from unutilized Atlantic salmon resources and achieve sustainable development of the blue economy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Blue Economy is an emerging paradigm with the potential to foster balanced socio-economic development of the world’s oceans and coastal areas, but it requires an understanding of the stakeholder landscape at a national and at an international sea basin scale, so that we can model potential equitable and collaborative economic development. Applying a novel, mixed-method approach we collected, collated and analysed spatial and non-spatial stakeholder information from five countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal), that border the North East Atlantic sea basin. Through the development of Blue Economy stakeholder directory for the North East Atlantic area more than 600 local, regional, national and international (EU wide and global) stakeholders were analysed in terms of their Blue Economy alignment and to determine their respective enabling role (financier, service providers, research/innovators and regulators/policy makers). Results show 72% of the North East Atlantic sea basin stakeholders fail to recognise the socio-economic potential of the Blue Economy, regardless of the new policy instruments and a strategic focus from the European Commission. We also identify that public and research/academic institutions currently dominate the landscape of Blue Economy stakeholders; but note this is inconsistent, when compared with other economic sectors in maritime territories. Based on the results, we discuss the key challenges facing equitable growth of the Blue Economy in the North East Atlantic area.

	abstract = {The floating buoys are an emerging source for renewable energy harvesting using ocean waves. Various point absorbers have been developed based on multi-freedom oscillating structures to capture wave energy. However, the choice of geometrical parameters for buoy design is still a critical problem. This paper presents a novel method to develop new geometries of floating buoy for wave energy harvester (WEH) in heave motion and aims to maximize WEH absorbed power and performance. Fives shapes (Cyl-Cone, Cyl-HS, Cyl-TCC, Cyl-AS and Cyl-SP) were derived from a cylinder buoy based on identical parameters (radius, draft, mass, water-plane area, volume and natural frequency). The Cyl-HS buoy was selected as a reference buoy for comparative analysis. The effects of shape change on the performance and output power were investigated for regular and irregular wave conditions in ANSYS AQWA at an incident wave frequency of 0.22 Hz (low energy density seas). The optimal resonant buoy was identified employing optimal and sub-optimal modes of the PTO system at external stiffness and damping parameters. Moreover, the performance of resonant buoys in optimal and suboptimal working modes was validated statistically using the F-test for variances of two samples in Origin Pro (2019). The energy conversion efficiencies of Cyl-AS buoy were examined as highest among others, with a maximum of 8.4% and 7.4% rise in optimal and suboptimal PTO modes for regular waves, respectively. For irregular waves, the Cyl-AS buoy resulted in maximum output power of 33.9% higher than the Cyl-HS buoy (reference buoy) with a maximum conversion efficiency of 90%. Finally, the simulation and experimental results for the scaled model were compared for RAO and average power and found a good agreement. The findings of this research agree with the UN-2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (in particular, SDG-7 and SDG-14 goals) while providing a path towards clean energy and blue economy developments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The paucity of information on marine ecotourism and the disproportionate influence of traditional activities in decision-making arenas represent a practical impediment to promoting the broader agenda of blue growth and ecosystem-based management for Europe's regional seas. This study presents an assessment of the socioeconomic impact of non-extractive recreational activities closely associated with marine biodiversity (i.e. whale watching, diving and big game fishing) in one of Europe's outermost regions: the Azores archipelago (northeast Atlantic). Data were collected through a series of questionnaire surveys of the clients (n = 1740) and managers of marine-tourism businesses (n = 49). Our results suggest that in 2014 approximately 17% of total visitors to the Azores engaged in marine ecotourism activities generating approximately 80€ million in total expenditures to the regional economy (2.2% of regional Gross Domestic Product). Results also indicate that on average a typical marine ecotourist has longer stay and higher expenditure pattern compared to other visitors. These values add a new dimension to arguments in support of marine conservation and call attention to the comprehensive integration of marine ecotourism activities in management plans. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Here, link prediction can help nodes to select proper links for data forwarding to reduce transmission failure. The existing prediction schemes are mainly based on analytical models with no adaptability, and consider relatively simple and small terrestrial wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a new link prediction algorithm based on machine learning, which is composed of an extractor of convolutional layers and an estimator of long short-term memory to extract useful representations of time-series data and identify effective long-term dependencies. The experiments manifest that the proposed scheme is more effective and flexible compared with the other link prediction schemes.

	abstract = {This article examines the wide acceptance and endorsement of the notion of the blue economy. It places the blue economy at the intersection of three discourses: the placelessness of the sea, development and sustainability. These discourses, originating on land, have spread spatially, narratively and normatively to the marine realm — part of a larger process of the normalization of the sea via its inclusion in the dominant model of economic development. The author uses the concept of horizontal reciprocity to illuminate this process of normalization. The blue economy requires and justifies the governance of maritime space; it creates economic and political opportunities and generates knowledge and interventions, leading to the territorialization of the sea. The article therefore concludes with a call for further research to critically assess the connections between macro discourses and local realities, and to address the current challenges facing the oceans. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to map-out African Union Member Countries and Regional Economic Communities engaged in Blue Economy. This engagement would provide some directed actions on how Blue Economy is contributing to achieving Sustainable Development in Africa. The methodology to analyze the Blue Economy data is based on “Sociographic, Type of activities, Intellectual Property focus and Business Model development, Descriptive Statistics, Business Models, Ranking of existing projects by business and innovation readiness”. Additional data obtained from Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and National Blue Economy Strategies and online internet search. The Blue Economy cuts-across several industries, sectors, and thematic areas. This inherently creates complexity when attempting to understand the extent of its socioeconomic context in aspiration of development achievement. The effect of human dependence on Blue Economy resources is not always monetary. Some of the people use the resources for artisanal purposes, for exchange and trade, while others utilize it for the recreational and religious benefits associated with the blue natural resources. The well-being of people is a central pillar of the Blue Economy resulting in an immediate need to understand the socioeconomics of the Blue Economy as well as how to measure changes, or progress, associated with it for development achievement. The planning aspect of Blue Economy requires strategic interventions at local, national, and regional levels that spur integration aspects of the Blue Economy into development achievement. The Blue Economy development achievements require engagement of the stakeholders and elaborate consultations of the African Union Member States and Regional Economic Communities. This is because Blue Economy entails the sustainable use and conservation of marine, inland, aquatic, and coastal resources for food security, job creation, and economic growth. It is important therefore to ensure an overall consistency, coherency and synergy and develop bridges and leverage resources between the various implementation plans for strategies including Blue Economy strategies developed by some National and Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in Africa.

	abstract = {Decisions about whether to include oil in blue economy plans can be controversial but also fundamental to the ability of these plans to transform (or not) business-as-usual in the oceans. This paper examines (a) how oil is sometimes included and justified in blue economy planning when its development is at odds with climate commitments and the need for just transitions away from fossil fuels, and (b) how oil could be included in blue economy planning, or transitions to blue economies and just energy transitions away from oil. We examine how tensions between sustainability/climate commitments and oil development impacts are resolved in practice, specifically by analyzing a particular approach to the blue economy that focuses on technology and innovation. The overlap of oil with renewable energy, specifically through technology, has become an important part of the recent ocean and blue economy narratives in oil-producing nations and illustrates the contradictions inherent in ocean development discourse. We draw specifically on the case of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), the only province in Canada with a mature offshore oil industry and thus the region most potentially impacted by decisions about whether to include oil in Canada’s blue economy. We argue that the blue economy approach to ocean governance being enacted in NL is currently being used as a form of legitimation for continuing the development of oil with no real transition plan away from it. Furthermore, we argue that blue economy plans must not only envision transitions to renewables but also explicitly and actively transitions away from oil to minimize environmental and social justice and equity issues at multiple scales. We end by highlighting some necessary conditions for how ocean economies that include oil, can transition to sustainable and equitable blue economies. © 2022 by the authors.

We show that to maintain critical alignment with targets for sustainability, place-based contextual development of blue economies that meet the needs of all actors is necessary. These needs relate to ensuring resilience against future environmental and political shocks, the maintenance of the ecological basis for thriving blue economies, and capacity development at all levels to support effective and equitable governance.

To instrument Blue Justice, it is important to understand injustices experienced by small-scale fisheries people which can range from accusations of disregard for the environment to equating their fishing practices as illegal, or even the sudden usurpation of their customary fishing grounds and means of livelihoods. Drawing on Fricker's concept of epistemic injustice, we examine how discrimination and lack of interpretative concepts to communicate unjust experiences wrongs small-scale fisheries people in their capacity as knowledge holders and subjects them to testimonial and hermeneutical injustice. We examine 20 testimonies of injustices experienced by small-scale fisheries people collected by the Global Research Network “Too Big To Ignore” (TBTI) and suggest a glossary of new concepts that can be used to interpret these experiences. Our results exemplify the presence of epistemic injustice, emphasizing the need to associate injustices in small-scale fisheries with non-conventional terms or concepts. We discuss the contribution of transdisciplinary research for providing such concepts and the potential role of social scientists and action researchers to enhance collective hermeneutical resources and thereby advance the goal of Blue Justice for small-scale fisheries. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Humans have relied on coastal resources for centuries. However, current growth in population and increased accessibility of coastal resources through technology have resulted in overcrowded and often conflicted spaces. The recent global move towards development of national blue economy strategies further highlights the increased focus on coastal resources to address a broad range of blue growth industries. The need to manage sustainable development and future exploitation of both over-utilised and emergent coastal resources is both a political and environmental complexity. To address this complexity, we draw on the perspectives of a multi-disciplinary team, utilising two in depth exemplary case studies in New Zealand and within the Myanmar Delta Landscape, to showcase barriers, pathways and actions that facilitate a move from Business as Usual (BAU) to a future aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the UN International Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021–2030. We provide key recommendations to guide interest groups, and nations globally, towards sustainable utilisation, conservation and preservation of their marine environments in a fair and equitable way, and in collaboration with those who directly rely upon coastal ecosystems. We envision a sustainable future driven by conflict mitigation and resolution, where:(i)Change is motivated and facilitated(ii)Coastal ecosystems are co-managed by multiple reliant groups(iii)Networks that maintain and enhance biodiversity are implemented(iv)Decision-making is equitable and based on ecosystem services(v)Knowledge of the marine realm is strengthened—‘mapping the ocean of life’(vi)The interests of diverse user groups are balanced with a fair distribution of benefits © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {There is growing concern about the impact of rising nutrient loading on aquatic ecosystems and on human health, due to increased urbanisation and associated sewage effluents. This has led to a policy focus on land-use change or agricultural practice change as nutrient mitigation strategies, but these fail to consider the ultimate downstream receiving environments such as marine ecosystems. Within the UK there has been increasing recognition that housing density in certain sensitive locations is impacting the conservation status of marine features, through the increase in nutrient loading to the marine environment. In order to comply with the statutory obligations to protect these marine features, the competent authorities have required developers to mitigate the impact of these additional nutrients. Current approaches include converting agricultural land to woodland and wetland habitats that release less nitrogen than the agricultural land they replace. This difference is used to offset the nutrient loading from the new development, but such a terrestrial-focused catchment-based mass balance approach has a number of limitations. Current solutions for nutrient neutrality in the UK take a narrow land-focused approach that fails to acknowledge the potential contribution of the marine environments to mitigate nutrient enrichment. We propose that marine nature-based solutions offer an economically and ecologically viable alternative to terrestrial schemes, that can reduce the nitrogen loading to the marine environment, increase ecosystem service provision and increase biodiversity. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Republic of Seychelles is one of six African Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and has a marine-based economy reliant on fisheries and international tourism. Seychelles has been flagged by the United Nations as highly vulnerable to climate change. Climatic threats are compounded with population declines of key fishery species. A progressive national stance towards ocean sustainability and an emerging economy partially driven by tourists are two of several factors that make Seychelles a good candidate for a sustainable seafood labelling and consumption programme, which would provide market-based incentives for fishery harvesters, regulators, buyers and consumers to improve sustainable practices. To address the feasibility of such a programme, we conducted a pilot study, surveying 33 artisanal fishers and mapping supply chain structure to examine incentives and challenges. Questions addressed fishers’ years of experience, reliance on fishing for income, and flexibility in gear type and species targeted. Of the total number of respondents, 64% would like to see a programme implemented but only 34% thought it would be successful. Participants identified several barriers and benefits that primarily spanned socioeconomic and regulatory themes. Our pilot results indicate the sociocultural and economic impacts of sustainability programmes in Seychelles are as important as environmental considerations, a finding pertinent to anyone undertaking similar research efforts in other SIDS. We advocate for the necessity of thorough, location-based research and in-depth stakeholder consultation to elucidate economic, societal, behavioural and cultural factors that will affect the success of designing and implementing seafood labelling programmes in SIDS.

When addressing these ocean risks, ensuring sufficient finance to sustain the marine ecosystem and resources is an ever-present challenge. Blue finance is a crucial tool to ensure ocean sustainability, aligned with economic growth. This article provides a conceptual understanding of this emerging concept and explores the potential of using legal and institutional mechanisms to increase investment in ocean development programs. By reviewing existing blue financing practices and identifying opportunities and challenges, we find the significant challenge is to develop connections between all stakeholders to illustrate potential incentives for increasing private investment and public donations. As such, we propose a regulatory-driven financing mechanism incorporating the core concepts of blue finance in the context of marine governance, both at the international and domestic levels. Our proposed approach would boost blue financing by seeking a balance between economic growth and ocean sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {While numerous Marine Protected Areas (MPA) have been created in the last decades, their effectiveness must be assessed in the context of the country’s biodiversity conservation policies and must be verified by local observations. Currently, the observations of local stakeholders, such as those from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, government civil servants, journalists, and fishers, are not considered in any MPA database. The Sea Around Us has added observations from local stakeholders to address this gap, adding their perspectives to its reconstructed fisheries catch database, and to at least one MPA in each country’s Exclusive Economic Zone. It is important to pursue and incentivize stakeholder knowledge sharing to achieve a better understanding of the current level of marine protection, as this information is a valuable addition to the existing MPA databases. To address this gap, we demonstrated that personal emails containing a one-question questionnaire about the fishing levels in an MPA are an excellent way to gather data from local stakeholders, and that this works especially well for respondents in NGOs, academia, and governments. Of the stakeholders who replied to our personalized email, 66% provided us with the fishing level of the MPA that we asked for. The paper also presents how to access this information through the Sea Around Us website, which details in anonymized form the most common fishing levels for each selected MPA, as perceived or observed by different local stakeholder groups. This information is a unique and novel addition to a website that is concerned with marine conservation and contributes to a more accurate and inclusive discourse around MPAs. This information also helps to identify the gaps that need to be addressed to turn ‘paper parks’ (i.e., MPAs that are legally designated but not effective) into effective MPAs, which can contribute to climate-resilient ‘blue economies’. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this research we collect, prepare and analyze a geospatial database of maritime activities located in the northern Bay of Bengal with the final aim to simulate maritime spatial planning (MSP) - ready information source for future sectoral and multi-sector MSP in Bangladesh. The database is composed of 28 anthropogenic and environmental layers categorized into seven Blue Economy sectors. The database is analyzed with a set of geospatial models aimed at understanding the intensity distribution of human activities at sea and the potential marine use conflicts emerging from the aggregation of human activities. Ecological resources were characterized in terms of marine mammals, lobsters, commercially important and threatened fish species, and pelagic birds and mapped as biodiversity hotspots using geographic cluster analysis. Results show that the most intensely used sea areas are located along the northeastern coast of Bangladesh, as well as in the Swatch of No Ground (SoNG) area, with maximum Marine Use Intensity (MUI) scores ranging from 5 to 8. Offshore waters of Saint Martin's Island have higher MUI scores (≥ 5) as well. The pairwise spatial conflict analysis shows that nature protection sites particularly SoNG Marine Protected Area (MPA), Nijhum Dwip Marine Reserve (MR), and Saint Martin's Island MPA are exposed to the high Marine Use Conflicts (MUC) induced by fishing and shipping activities. Fishing operations generate the highest MUC value (MUC = 30) in SoNG MPA, whereas shipping activities produce the highest MUC value (MUC = 24) in Nijhum Dwip MR. Both of the MPAs exhibit 6 to 12 MUC scores induced by shipping. The proposed database together with the illustrated analytical techniques used in this study and key findings can provide the first understanding of the priorities for Ecosystem Based Management of Bangladesh's marine space and provide valuable insights on the urgency for MSP process in the country. The study concludes with an outlook on the utility of the database for future analysis. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Connectivity and representativity are essential factors that underlie successful implementation of MPA networks, which can safeguard biological diversity and ecosystem function, and ultimately support the blue economy strategy by balancing ocean use with conservation. New “big data” omics approaches, including genomics and transcriptomics, are becoming essential tools for the development and maintenance of MPA networks. Current molecular omics techniques, including population-scale genome sequencing, have direct applications for assessing population connectivity and for evaluating how genetic variation is represented within and among MPAs. Effective baseline characterization and long-term, scalable, and comprehensive monitoring are essential for successful MPA management, and omics approaches hold great promise to characterize the full range of marine life, spanning the microbiome to megafauna across a range of environmental conditions (shallow sea to the deep ocean). Omics tools, such as eDNA metabarcoding can provide a cost-effective basis for biodiversity monitoring in large and remote conservation areas. Here we provide an overview of current omics applications for conservation planning and monitoring, with a focus on metabarcoding, metagenomics, and population genomics. Emerging approaches, including whole-genome sequencing, characterization of genomic architecture, epigenomics, and genomic vulnerability to climate change are also reviewed. We demonstrate that the operationalization of omics tools can enhance the design, monitoring, and management of MPAs and thus will play an important role in a modern and comprehensive blue economy strategy.

	abstract = {Transitioning to a Blue Economy that prioritizes social equity will be challenging in ocean sectors but could be comparatively easier for newer industries where appropriate guidelines can be followed from the start. We focus here on two emerging ocean sectors—blue carbon and ocean energy—and an evaluation of benefit-sharing agreements at operational sites, and the recipients and types of these benefits. This is an initial yet useful gauge of progress towards integration of social equity concerns as envisioned under a Blue Economy. The number (n = 84) and scale of ocean energy sites is rapidly increasing but highly concentrated in a few regions. The ocean energy sector is currently focused on serving grids in urbanized areas and reducing national emissions, and economic benefit-sharing mechanisms with local residents are less common (35% of all sites). However, some cases show how local communities can be better included in the planning and implementation of ocean energy, including negotiation of subsequent economic benefits. Despite widespread interest in blue carbon, we found very few (n = 4) operational sites; nonetheless, these were deeply involved with and often led by local communities who are the main beneficiaries. Voluntary public and corporate social responsibility actions are useful, but government regulation must play an essential role in requiring equitable processes and supporting equitable outcomes, similar to now-standard environmental regulations to avoid negative impacts and increase the likelihood of ecological sustainability. Emerging ocean sectors have a unique opportunity to advance social equity and environmental sustainability within Blue Economies, but this will be much more easily achieved if equity guidelines are prioritized and mandated so that business-as-usual practices do not become entrenched. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recreational charter boat fisheries provide alternative economic development to traditional commercial fisheries, especially to coastal communities in warm seas. Charter boat fishing has been little studied in temperate regions, and the factors that trigger its development and social contribution to fishing communities are unknown. We performed an economic analysis of recreational charter boat fisheries in the Eastern North Atlantic to assess their contribution to social welfare. We selected two case studies located in Galicia (NW Spain) and Madeira archipelago (Portugal). The two cases differ in the socioecological attributes in which recreational charter boat fishing is developed (e.g., relevance of commercial fishing, tourism, or targeted species), that were included in the assessment. Up to 7 charter fishing companies were identified in Galicia (10 boats) and 14 in Madeira (18 boats), and information on the costs and benefits of the activity were collected by a questionnaire answered by company managers and skippers. Charter boats in Galicia are operating throughout the year, and anglers mostly engage in bottom fishing targeting demersal predators like ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) that they retain. Despite the strong seasonality of the fishery in Madeira, focused on summers, the fishing effort is higher than in Galicia. On average, charter boats go fishing for 39.3 ± 41.5 (SD) fishing journeys and take 2 500 anglers on board per year in Galicia, while in Madeira they fish 63.7 ± 32.7 journeys and take 3 200 anglers on board. Anglers target in Madeira pelagic top predators like blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), or some tuna species, e.g., bigeye (Thunnus obesus), by trolling in a catch and release fishery. The economic balance of companies was more favorable in Madeira, with an average gross annual profit of € 28 883 ± 30 755, while economic yield in Galicia was € 4 444 ± 7 916. We also applied a travel cost method to assess the recreation demand of recreational fishing trips based on a questionnaire answered by 150 clients in Galicia and 55 in Madeira. We estimated the visitor surplus mean value to be € 1 385 per year in Galicia (95% confidence interval, CI95%= € 1 219 – € 1 550), and € 1 738 in Madeira (CI95%= € 1 433 – 2 043). The social annual recreation value of Galician fishery was worth € 3.4 Million, ranging between € 3.0 M and € 3.8 M, a value well below the annual economic impact generated by commercial fishing (€ 700 M). The recreation value of the charter boat fishery in Madeira, € 6.3 M, ranging between € 5.2 M and € 7.5 M, is comparable to the annual economic impact of commercial fishing, that contributes to the local economy with € 12 M.

	abstract = {In a 2019 European Commission report, the Blue Economy (BE) within the United Kingdom (UK) represented 22% of the European Union's (EU) BE Gross Value Added (GVA) at approximately €39 billion. Coupled with the clear value of the BE to the UK, there is an urgent need to innovate and develop technologies to decarbonise and advance the sector. A deeper understanding of the current position for multiple stakeholders must be considered before any major governmental or long-term strategy decisions can be made. This paper presents the perspective of academic, industrial and governmental stakeholders analysis of how the UK can move forward with developing innovations within the BE. Utilising a questionnaire and round table discussions, specialists from all stakeholders gave their opinions on industry-academia-governmental working relationships and technology transfer readiness. Reasonably high satisfaction was found with key aspects that enable a successful collaborative project between academia and industry towards technology commercialisation; however, there is still room for improvement. This paper offers an analysis of how to further enhance and foster technology development within the UK BE. A collaborative approach is proposed to ensure best practices, and a ‘triple helix’ (TH) collaboration strategy to be used as a tool for those engaging in these types of working relationships. Future directions on enhancing technology transfer innovation within the UK BE are also suggested. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The Blue Economy is a global initiative aimed at using marine resources to create economic viability and environmental sustainability. While successes have been reported, for example, in Europe and China, examples of African successes are notably missing. Abject poverty, unemployment and food insecurity are everyday concerns on the African continent; however, its large latitudinal coverage gives rise to extremely biodiverse marine fauna, which could promote socio-economic development of coastal communities through initiatives such as sustainably-managed fisheries. In order to improve sustainability via improved management, information on a species and its habitat is needed, particularly how it moves and in which areas it occurs. Acoustic telemetry is a powerful tool used to determine the movements of aquatic animals, the success of which has led to the development of several large-scale networks throughout the globe, including South Africa’s Acoustic Tracking Array Platform. This network, formally in place for the last decade, has now matured, and data are revealing insights into residency, habitat connectivity and transboundary movements of a multitude of animals, with some species having been continually detected for the past 10 years. These data are also actively being incorporated into marine spatial planning efforts, with the aim of protecting threatened and endemic species. Due to knowledge generation, successful benefit-sharing arrangements, and dedication to engage with the public and other stakeholder groups, the ATAP represents a highly successful example of ocean stewardship in Africa.

The European Union Green Deal represents a strategy towards a sustainable economic model. In this framework, land-based geothermics has seen very limited development; however, offshore geothermics is almost completely absent in the discussion on energy source alternatives, even though it represents a real challenge for energy transition, including the production of green hydrogen. This article discusses an excursus on the activities carried out on offshore geothermal areas worldwide. We focused on the energy potential capacity of the Marsili volcanic seamount located over the bathial plain of the Tyrrhenian Basin, describing the detailed geological, geochemical, and geophysical investigations that have been carried out on that seamount since the 2000s. All the collected data have shown evidence supporting the existence of an exploitable geothermal system in the Marsili seamount consisting of a reservoir of supercritical geothermal fluids of about 100 km3. We discuss and evaluate the actual consistence of the impacts associated with the occurrence of potential risks. We also describe the necessary further steps towards the pilot well. An important breakthrough in the short-medium term that allows for an exit from the predominance of fossil sources may come from the development of energy production derived from offshore high-enthalpy geothermal fields, especially in areas such as the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea. There is a natural clear predisposition for its exploitation combined with a low ecological footprint, which is the target objective of international agreements in the context of a blue economy strategy. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The human response to the COVID-19 pandemic set in motion an unprecedented shift in human activity with unknown long-term effects. The impacts in marine systems are expected to be highly dynamic at local and global scales. However, in comparison to terrestrial ecosystems, we are not well-prepared to document these changes in marine and coastal environments. The problems are two-fold: 1) manual and siloed data collection and processing, and 2) reliance on marine professionals for observation and analysis. These problems are relevant beyond the pandemic and are a barrier to understanding rapidly evolving blue economies, the impacts of climate change, and the many other changes our modern-day oceans are undergoing. The “Our Ocean in COVID-19″ project, which aims to track human-ocean interactions throughout the pandemic, uses the new eOceans platform (eOceans.app) to overcome these barriers. Working at local scales, a global network of ocean scientists and citizen scientists are collaborating to monitor the ocean in near real-time. The purpose of this paper is to bring this project to the attention of the marine conservation community, researchers, and the public wanting to track changes in their area. As our team continues to grow, this project will provide important baselines and temporal patterns for ocean conservation, policy, and innovation as society transitions towards a new normal. It may also provide a proof-of-concept for real-time, collaborative ocean monitoring that breaks down silos between academia, government, and at-sea stakeholders to create a stronger and more democratic blue economy with communities more resilient to ocean and global change. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Abstract: The ocean economy is experiencing rapid growth that will provide benefits but will also pose environmental and social risks. With limited space and degraded resources in coastal areas, offshore waters will be a particular focus of Blue Economy expansion over the next decade. When emerging and established economic sectors expand in offshore waters (within national Exclusive Economic Zones), different potential Blue Economy opportunities and challenges will arise. Following a series of interdisciplinary workshops, we imagine two technically possible futures for the offshore Blue Economy and we identify the actions required to achieve the more sustainable outcome. Under a business as usual scenario the focus will remain on economic growth, the commodification of nature, the dominance of private over public and cultural interests, and prioritisation of the interests of current over future generations. A more sustainable scenario would meet multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals and ensure inclusive economic developments, environmental sustainability, and fair and equitable access to resources and technologies across users, nations, and generations. Challenges to this more sustainable future are a lack of infrastructure and technology to support emerging offshore sectors, limited understanding of environmental impacts, inequitable outcomes, and a lack of planning and governmental oversight. Addressing these challenges will require a shift in societal values, a more balanced allocation of funding to offshore activities, transparency in information sharing between industries and across nations, and adjustment of international legal and institutional mechanisms. The sustainable and equitable offshore Blue Economy we envisage is achievable and provides a unique opportunity to build global capacity and partnership.

	abstract = {The global seaweed market is currently valued at USD $11 billion annually and utilizes about 29 million tonnes of seaweed (dry weight) for a variety of applications (Ferdouse et al., Globefish Res Programme 124:I, 2018). By 2025 the global market is estimated to reach USD $30.2 billion dollars (Bloomberg, Seaweed Cultivation Market worth $30.2 billion by 2025. Retrieved 06/08/2021, 2021, from , 2020). The current Australian seaweed market is valued at US$3 million, which is relatively small, contributing only 0.03% to the global market. However, the Blue Economy CRC and Marine Bioproducts CRC together have resulted in a public/private funding of nearly AUD $600 million over the past 3 years with the aim of expanding towards a billion-dollar seaweed market in Australia within the next decade. Furthermore, a recent CSIRO Data 61 report identified 'Microalgal and Macroalgal Resources' as an emerging growth sector, specifically in the state of Queensland (Naughtin et al., A New Chapter: Opportunities to seed new industries for Queensland over the coming decade. CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, pp 1-85, 2021). Currently, most of the seaweeds on the Australian market are imported, and this sector has seen a rapid expansion from 2005 to 2017. This growth highlights the increasing demand for seaweed products in Australia and potential for the expansion of domestic producers. International seaweed markets are also expanding rapidly at a rate of 12% and so offer significant export opportunities (IMARC, Seaweed Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2021-2026. Retrieved 06/08/2021, 2021, from, 2021). Despite the huge domestic biodiversity of seaweeds and their use by First Nations peoples, the commercialisation of native seaweed products has been limited. To date, seaweed cultivation and research has been broadly managed by the Department of Aquaculture and Marine Sciences, and more recently this has expanded to specific organisations (e.g. CSIRO, AgriFutures, ASI) and an increasing number of universities (e.g. the combined marine cooperative research centers (CRCs) have been approved for a total of AUD $580 million development over the next 10 years for marine bioproduct development and the blue economy with a consortium of ~100 industry, government and research partners). These collaborative networks with seaweed production companies provide evidence of a growing interest and demand for seaweed-based products in Australia and internationally. The two major seaweeds cultivated in Australia today comprise Durvillaea potatorum and Undaria pinnatifida. D. potatorum (commonly known as Bull Kelp) is a native brown seaweed species, which is collected primarily on King Island (Tasmania). Sustainable harvesting both generates an income of about AUD $2.63 million annually and helps preserve kelp forest ecosystems, motivating further research and sustainable cultivation. Both species are widely used to produce thickening agents for the food and cosmetics industry. In Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria there are currently a number of promising seaweed-based research projects developing seaweed-based products ranging from 3D bio-printing technology, livestock feed (methane emissions mitigation) and optimisation of seaweed mariculture systems. This chapter reviews current trends and future perspectives of seaweed-based products in the Australian market, highlighting the limitation of import and export restrictions and the importance of expanding investments into research on native strains. A growing domestic Australian seaweed industry not only offers to create regional jobs and reduce the cost of imports but has significant opportunities to become an export industry, extending value chains in the near future. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

	abstract = {To effectively future-proof the management of the European Union fishing fleets we have explored a suite of case studies encompassing the northeast and tropical Atlantic, the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas. This study shows that European Union (EU) fisheries are likely resilient to climate-driven short-term stresses, but may be negatively impacted by long-term trends in climate change. However, fisheries’ long-term stock resilience can be improved (and therefore be more resilient to increasing changes in climate) by adopting robust and adaptive fisheries management, provided such measures are based on sound scientific advice which includes uncertainty. Such management requires regular updates of biological reference points. Such updates will delineate safe biological limits for exploitation, providing both high long-term yields with reduced risk of stock collapse when affected by short-term stresses, and enhanced compliance with advice to avoid higher than intended fishing mortality. However, high resilience of the exploited ecosystem does not necessarily lead to the resilience of the economy of EU fisheries from suffering shocks associated with reduced yields, neither to a reduced carbon footprint if fuel use increases from lower stock abundances. Fuel consumption is impacted by stock development, but also by changes in vessel and gear technologies, as well as fishing techniques. In this respect, energy-efficient fishing technologies already exist within the EU, though implementing them would require improving the uptake of innovations and demonstrating to stakeholders the potential for both reduced fuel costs and increased catch rates. A transition towards reducing fuel consumption and costs would need to be supported by the setup of EU regulatory instruments. Overall, to effectively manage EU fisheries within a changing climate, flexible, adaptive, well-informed and well-enforced management is needed, with incentives provided for innovations and ocean literacy to cope with the changing conditions, while also reducing the dependency of the capture fishing industry on fossil fuels. To support such management, we provide 10 lessons to characterize ‘win-win’ fishing strategies for the European Union, which develop leverages in which fishing effort deployed corresponds to Maximum Sustainable Yield targets and Common Fisheries Policy minimal effects objectives. In these strategies, higher catch is obtained in the long run, less fuel is spent to attain the catch, and the fisheries have a higher resistance and resilience to shock and long-term factors to face climate-induced stresses.

	abstract = {Global phosphorus reserves are under pressure of depletion in the near future due to increased consumption of primary phosphorus reservoirs and improper management of phosphorus. At the same time, a considerable portion of global marine water bodies has been suffering from eutrophication due to excessive nutrient loading. The marine environment can be considered as a valuable phosphorus source due to nutrient rich eutrophic seawater and sediment which could potentially serve as phosphorus mines in the near future. Hence, sustainable phosphorus recovery strategies should be adapted for marine systems to provide phosphorus for the growing market demand and simultaneously control eutrophication. In this review, possible sustainable strategies for phosphorus removal and recovery from marine environments are discussed in detail. Bio-based strategies relying on natural phosphorus uptake/release metabolism of living organisms are suggested as promising options that can provide both phosphorus removal and recovery from marine waters for achieving a sustainable marine ecosystem. Among them, the utilization of microorganisms seems promising to develop novel strategies. However, the research gap for the technical applicability of these strategies is still considerably big. Therefore, future research should focus on the technical development of the strategies through laboratory and/or field studies. Coupling phosphorus mining with other valorisation pathways (i.e., metal recovery, energy production) is also suggested to improve overall sustainability and economic viability. Environmental, economic and societal challenges should altogether be well addressed prior to real scale applications. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Multiple ocean sectors compete for space and resources, creating conflicts but also opportunities to plan for synergistic outcomes that benefit multiple sectors. Planning and management are increasingly informed by qualitative and quantitative methods for assessing multi-sector interactions to identify trade-offs and synergies among sectors and with the environment, but there is a need to critically review the alignment of these tools with the requirements of Blue Economy stakeholders. Through a systematic literature review, an operational maturity analysis, and a survey of Blue Economy stakeholders, we found that the most well-developed tools for assessing interactions between multiple Blue Economy industries, and with the environment, are spatial prioritization tools, such as Marxan and multi-criteria decision support tools; and spatial static tools, such as cumulative effect mapping. More complex process/dynamic tools such as ecosystem and oceanographic models are well developed for single sectors, particularly water quality assessments and commercial fisheries, but have been less commonly applied in multi-sector contexts. Our review and stakeholder survey highlighted that assessing the environmental and operational suitability of sites for Blue Economy infrastructure in conjunction with operational impacts, trade-offs and decommissioning considerations requires: 1) a toolbox of approaches that covers a range of spatial, temporal and ecological scales; 2) tools that capture interactions and feedbacks among sectors, and with the environment, without being unnecessarily complicated (i.e., tractable to use and allow for effective communication of findings); and 3) continued synthesis of approaches and tools used across sectors such as commercial fishing, aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, and offshore engineering. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Bangladesh is a maritime country with an area of 118000 km2 which supports a large number of commercially important species. Currently seaweeds are considered as important component of blue economy development in Bangladesh and farming is practiced at small scale level (Hypnea spp, Caulerpha reacemosa, Gelidium sp. are cultured). For the expansion of the seaweed farming in Bangladesh, a complete understanding of social and economic status of current farmers is important. However, information on socio-economic status of seaweed industry in Bangladesh is very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to understand existing culture methods and their cost, marketing channel and problems with seaweed farming in south east coast of Bangladesh. We used questionnaire survey and focus group discussions to collect data from seaweed farmers, researchers, local community and entrepreneurs. The study found that farmers are currently practicing long-line and horizontal net methods for the seaweed farming in the south east coastal region. The study also found that these culture methods are economically profitable. Seaweeds are currently sold locally and a proper value chain for seaweed marketing is still missing. Existing seaweed farmers are facing the problems related to insufficient credits for starting seaweed farming, lack of proper guidelines for farming and processing of harvested seaweed. This study suggests that for industrial level expansion of seaweed production in Bangladesh a proper value chain, development of seaweed derived products, farm monitoring systems, smooth seed supply and information hubs are required. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The innovative concept of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has a huge impact in different sectors including a small scientific laboratory, to a medium sized harbor, and to monitor vast undiscovered oceans. Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has become a powerful technology to support various applications such as collecting real-time aquatic information, naval military applications, maritime security, natural disaster prediction and control, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwrecks discovery, water contamination, marine life observation and smart Ocean. IoUT is referred as smart intricately linked underwater objects to monitor these underwater operations. The IoUT framework incorporates several underwater communication technologies based on magnetic induction, optical signals, radio signals and acoustic waves. It is an emerging communication ecosystem which can reveal a new era of research, business and naval applications. It is a novel and vibrant paradigm for the Blue Economy sector bringing the ability to communicate autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensing, actuating and transferring this data to control centers using regular internet speeds through low cost technologies. It is anticipated to support future networking systems which can bring tremendous improvement in previous generations in terms of stable networking, high coverage, massive connectivity, low latency, high data rate and low power consumption. This study introduces the possible network framework of IoUT which is naturally heterogeneous and must be flexible enough to work under unpredicted ocean conditions. In this study, we examine channel models, routing protocols, networking topologies and simulation tools. Furthermore, we discussed recent advancements in IoUT in terms of smart devices, consumer electronics, communication and role of AUVs. In addition, edge computing, optical wireless communication (OWC), data analytics, blockchain, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and machine learning were viewed as promising techniques to support IoUT. We have dedicated a complete section to applications of IoUT. Finally, numerous open research challenges and future directions were presented. We believe this survey will be helpful to aggregate the research efforts and eliminate the technical uncertainties towards breakthrough novelties of IoUT. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Spain, one of the European countries most affected by this pandemic, implemented restrictive strategies in the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis that also affected fishing activities. The aim of this article is to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the profitability, revenues and employment of Spanish shipowning companies whose vessels operate in the Celtic Sea. Through a population sample of 64 companies, the performance of variables such as turnover, total assets, number of employees, return on assets, return on equity or profit margin before interest and taxes has been assessed. The results show a variation of − 25% in turnover, − 10% in the number of employees and − 80% in economic and financial profitability. This is a case of failure of collective action, in which the lack of a contingency plan at the public and private level accentuated the negative consequences of the pandemic, especially in the first state of alarm. In addition, a strong interdependence was detected between the catches of the most valuable species and the activity of the HORECA channel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ocean observations are required to provide timely evidence of facts about the ocean in order to evaluate the sustainable management of biodiversity, climate change, fisheries, mineral resources, tourism, and any other anthropogenic activities that support blue economy policymaking. In Japan, this is particularly crucial given that it is an islandic country stretching from north to south, thereby having a diverse coastal environment. Although tremendous efforts towards ocean observations have been made, coordination among sectors is not always sufficient, which prevented availing the comprehensive capacity of ocean observation. In this study, the existing observation platforms and installed sensors, particularly fixed platforms that enable real-time data transmission, were reviewed, and the spatial distribution of them was investigated. It was confirmed that a large number of observation networks cover Japanese waters; however, many of those platforms were used for single purpose, and the spatial coverage was still considerably limited for some sensors, such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a. It must be noted that this study intentionally limited the data sources of platforms/sensors to the disclosed data on public reports and/or websites, in order to raise a discussion about information disclosure of observation efforts, conducted by numerous stakeholders. Based on this information, we recommend extending the capacity of ocean observation by utilizing existing platforms rather than constructing new platforms, in order to enhance cost-effectiveness. © 2022},

	abstract = {To limit compromising the integrity of the planet, a shift is needed towards food production with low environmental impacts and low carbon footprint. How to put such transformative change towards sustainable food production whilst ensuring food security into practice remains a challenge and will require transdisciplinary approaches. Combining expertise from natural- and social sciences as well as industry perspectives, an alternative vision for the future in the marine realm is proposed. This vision includes moving towards aquaculture mainly of low trophic marine (LTM) species. Such shift may enable a blue transformation that can support a sustainable blue economy. It includes a whole new perspective and proactive development of policy-making which considers, among others, the context-specific nature of allocation of marine space and societal acceptance of new developments, over and above the decarbonization of food production, vis á vis reducing regulatory barriers for the industry for LTM whilst acknowledging the complexities of upscaling and outscaling. This needs to be supported by transdisciplinary research co-produced with consumers and wider public, as a blue transformation towards accelerating LTM aquaculture opportunities in a net zero-carbon world can only occur by considering the demands of society.

Mangrove restoration efforts have received considerable attention in the States of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh for their role in the mitigation of storms and cyclones. The ‘community-based restoration' strategy, in particular, is credited with expansion of mangrove regions across India. This study highlights the mechanism of successful mangrove restoration and conservation through various efforts of the government, private sector, and the coastal community in the state of Gujarat, India. Despite rapid coastal development, mangrove cover has also steadily increased in the last few decades in the State, clearly indicating a balanced approach towards enhancing blue economy. This is credited to the vision of the Government of Gujarat, India for putting in place appropriate policies and their effective implementation. Restoration of degraded mangrove and afforestation of new mangroves were made successful by applying scientific transplantation of saplings, utilization of local resources, involvement of public and private sectors and efficient monitoring activities. The Government of Gujarat has developed a comprehensive approach to integrate diverse sectors to effectively conserve mangroves and adopting a community-based restoration model. Such efforts at the regional level are the first-ever large-scale restoration and afforestation measures in India. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

It is establishing a globally harmonized framework to deliver actionable, transdisciplinary knowledge of marine functional connectivity, promoting a sustainable blue economy and ocean conservation. Planning sustainable development in rapidly changing oceans requires a thorough comprehension of marine biodiversity and the processes underpinning the functioning of ecosystems. Connectivity among marine populations and habitats facilitates the persistence and resilience of vulnerable species and ecosystems and controls the spread of invasive species. Construct-ing effective networks of restoration or conservation areas and promoting sustainable harvesting requires knowledge of connectivity. SEA-UNICORN advances worldwide collaboration by coordinating the collection, sharing, and application of knowledge on species, community, and ecosystem connectivity at sea and at the land–sea interface.

	abstract = {The expected growth of the global economy and the projected rise in world population call for a greatly increased supply of materials critical for implementing clean technologies, such as rare earth elements (REEs) and other rare metals. Because the demand for critical metals is increasing and land-based mineral deposits are being depleted, seafloor resources are seen as the next frontier for mineral exploration and extraction. Marine mineral deposits with a great resource potential for transition, rare, and critical metals include mainly deep-sea mineral deposits, such as polymetallic sulfides, polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich crusts, phosphorites, and rare earth element-rich muds. Major areas with economic interest for seabed mineral exploration and mining are the following: nodules in the Penrhyn Basin-Cook Islands Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Clarion-Clipperton nodule Zone, Peru Basin nodules, and the Central Indian Ocean Basin; seafloor massive sulfide deposits in the exclusive economic zones of Papua New Guinea, Japan, and New Zealand as well as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the three Indian Ocean spreading ridges; cobalt-rich crusts in the Pacific Prime Crust Zone and the Canary Islands Seamounts and the Rio Grande Rise in the Atlantic Ocean; and the rare earth element-rich deep-sea muds around Minamitorishima Island in the equatorial North Pacific. In addition, zones for marine phosphorites exploration are located in Chatham Rise, offshore Baja California, and on the shelf off Namibia. Moreover, shallow-water resources, like placer deposits, represent another marine source for many critical minerals, metals, and gems. The main concerns of deep-sea mining are related to its environmental impacts. Ecological impacts of rare earth element mining on deep-sea ecosystems are still poorly evaluated. Furthermore, marine mining may cause conflicts with various stakeholders such as fisheries, communications cable owners, offshore wind farms, and tourism. The global ocean is an immense source of food, energy, raw materials, clean water, and ecosystem services and suffers seriously by multiple stressors from anthropogenic sources. The development of a blue economy strategy needs a better knowledge of the environmental impacts. By protecting vulnerable areas, applying new technologies for deep-sea mineral exploration and mining, marine spatial planning, and a regulatory framework for minerals extraction, we may achieve sustainable management and use of our oceans.  © 2022 IUPAC & De Gruyter.

	abstract = {Oceans are increasingly looked toward for their contribution to addressing climate change. These so-called ocean-based climate “solutions” often fall under the umbrella of the “blue economy,” a term used to refer to new ways of organizing ocean economies to provide equitable economic and environmental benefits. Yet, thus far the literature exploring blue economies and blue economy governance has largely overlooked or downplayed its equity and justice roots and implications, including how blue economies are embedded in multiple scales of environmental injustices. This is particularly important when blue economies include offshore oil production. The purpose of this paper is to both emphasize the need and provide an approach to incorporate justice and equity—specifically climate justice—into blue economy planning and scholarship. We build on conceptualizations of blue economies as assemblages to draw attention to the global reach of climate impacts associated with oil that are often overlooked or ignored at sites of production and through regional governance. We argue that greenhouse gas emissions from the life cycle of oil should be included in policies and planning (including blue economy planning) at sites of production, but that this must also incorporate underlying power structures that lead to uneven impacts and climate injustice. We look at environmental assessments as a regional governance tool that could be used to shape opportunities and openings to organize blue economies differently. To illustrate these points, we look at how environmental assessments are playing (and could play) a role in enacting and shaping Newfoundland and Labrador's blue economy. © 2022 The Authors},

Globally, restoration commitments have focused overwhelmingly on terrestrial forests. In contrast, despite a strong value proposition, efforts to restore seaweed forests lag far behind other major ecosystems and continue to be dominated by small-scale, short-term academic experiments. However, seaweed forest restoration can match the scale of damage and threat if moved from academia into the hands of community groups, industry, and restoration practitioners. Connecting two rapidly growing sectors in the Blue Economy—seaweed cultivation and the restoration industry—can transform marine forest restoration into a commercial-scale enterprise that can make a significant contribution to global restoration efforts. © 2022 Phycological Society of America.},
