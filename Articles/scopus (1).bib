	abstract = {This study aims to uncover maritime development policies in Indonesia. This study uses a qualitative methodological approach. The findings are that maritime development policy is a priority of the government, particularly inter-island connectivity, more optimal use of maritime potential, and empowerment of fishermen. However, no innovative programs as a factor that can make Indonesia a great maritime country have been seen. Investment is still minimal, and the quality of human resources and the supporting capacity of technology are still very limited. Communities working in the maritime sector are still in the traditional form, ignoring ecosystems and continuing to exploit the potential of the sea. The blue economy concept is not yet understood and implemented as a creative investment that can create a double profit from any economic activity in the maritime sector. But, the application of blue economy will encourage the economic growth, employment, overcome poverty, and preserve the environment. The institutional system, work programs, and socioeconomic orientation between the government and the community at the local level greatly differ. © Common Ground Research Networks, Rusman Ghazali, All Rights Reserved.},

This paper conducted an assessment of the directions followed by the research and innovation activities performed by Portuguese organisations in the fields encompassed by the “Blue Economy”, at the light of national and EU strategies. The paper draws on an analysis of the projects developed by Portuguese actors in the context of European framework programmes to investigate: the areas that are being privileged and the role and positioning of different types of actors in the developments taking place. The results point to the emergence of new activities such as marine biotechnology and marine renewable industries, as well as the development of innovations in established industries exploiting marine living resources (fisheries and aquaculture). They likewise reveal that the research and technological activities towards the revitalisation of other established sea-related industries is still very limited. The results also highlight the prominent position of research organisations in both new and established areas. But they equally uncover the relevant position occupied by new technology intensive firms, particularly in areas that require the development of more application oriented methods, products, services, where they are often involved in tripartite relationships, intermediating between research and industrial application. Finally the results suggest that the international cooperation favoured by these projects permit to open-up the national system, contributing to broaden the organisations’ knowledge bases and to extend their international networks. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The "Blue Economy" was strategically identified as a driver of European growth, through the development of new competences and activities that enable a sustainable exploitation of ocean resources. Research and innovation policies oriented to the Blue Economy, at both European and country levels, can be described as attempts at "mission-oriented" policies, which seek to influence the direction of growth towards sustainable transformative change in the ocean area. The objective of this paper is to analyse the directions followed by the research and technological development (RTD) activities conducted by Portuguese firms in order to understand whether the strategies and policies aiming at the development of the Blue Economy are being effective in their endeavour of steering such development in certain directions, thus creating conditions for a sustainable transformation in ocean related areas. The results provide some evidence of the role being performed by RTD promoted by these policies towards a transformative change in ocean related activities. Particularly, they show that they are contributing to: I) the generation of new areas and the revitalisation of existing sectors, through the creation and exploitation of new technological opportunities; and ii) a sustainable use of resources and the mitigation of negative environmental effects created by previous activities. Moreover, the results show intense interaction between different types of organisations. Particularly, they show that new technology intensive firms and industries are working together with existing firms from traditional sectors to exploit the new opportunities and technologies. The evidence suggests processes of cross fertilisation and technological upgrading of traditional activities, through the interaction in the RTD projects funded by clearly targeted public policies. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

	abstract = {The methodological approach of the blue economy allows us to determine the effect of certain animal groups on monetary returns on a global scale. In this sense, cetaceans have not been enough studied. However, there is important evidences on its positive impact on the human economy. Their feces have an important fertilizing effect, as they capture trace elements (Iron and Magnesium) from deep waters and return them to the sea surface. In addition, cetaceans are one of the longest-lived animal groups in marine ecosystems acting as carbon reservoirs. As if this were not enough, cetaceans are species of great tourist interest, as the whale watching sector is an emerging economic resource in many countries. Finally, some species, such as the sperm whale, produce products such as ambergris, greatly appreciated by the cosmetic industry. In this paper, we analyze all these positive economic effects of cetaceans. Although, we have focused especially on the sperm whale, we propose a global mathematical model of carbon fixation for all these mammal species. Our results point to a new line of research that not only considers these animals in terms of conservation, but as an important economic resource for humanity. © 2019 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

In many cases, however, the natural environment is transformed as an unjustified receiver of pollutants produced by tourism activities, which could be possible, degraded the environment and disturb the ecological balance. This fact activated an original research effort to study whether the potential ecological and environmental distortions in the island were to be identified so that a tourism policy could be adapted to the island's natural environment. During the data collection, tourist accommodation was recorded in all Lefkada's municipalities by additional data collection of natural, cultural, human and artificial environment. The resulting data were further processed with software programs and showed that the geological specificity of Lefkada's island affects the spatial arrangement and distribution of local and seasonal tourist populations. As an impact of this, the potential zones of pressure in Lefkada are separated into coastal outer zone and two inner, semi-mountainous zones. The coastal zone receives the highest pressure and has the highest potential for pollution, mainly on the north and east sides of the island, due to the existence of ports and natural anchors and the explosive development of small and multi-purpose tourist accommodation within 2 Km of the coastline. Semi-mountainous areas that may be prone to land use problems have also been surveyed due to the growing tourism spatial activity. Higher altitudes show a continuing trend of improving alternative forms of tourism, but the potential for pollution is limited but this does not mean that the ecological balance cannot be disturbed.  © 2020 SPIE.},

	abstract = {The blue economy is the recent initiative among Indian Ocean realm association (IORA) countries, ASEAN and Caribbean Islands focusing towards sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improvised livelihoods and jobs and preserving ocean ecosystem health. High-density population resides in coastal and islandic regions of these countries and with climate change, rising sea level is seen an imminent danger to the coastal community in the low-lying area. To counter the rising sea level, countries are looking for technologies to support the displaced coastal population by embarking on floating homes and floating cities in their Blue Growth strategy to support living space and amenities needs. Since these floating homes and cities are powered through fossil fuel there is a need to preserve the Coastal marine ecology from the emissions. This paper discusses about powering the floating homes through ocean based floating clean energy systems as a cost-effective energy system that can be manufactured, assembled and maintained in the onshore and easily towed and deployed at a specific ocean site and assure energy security and resilience even during natural disasters. In addition, the paper discusses the idea of hybrid renewable powered energy systems to exploit the multiple available energy sources at the specific site viz., tidal, ocean thermal, wave, solar and wind that may vary in different proportion of availability to increase overall energy generation density from the ocean site. To illustrate, a case study of floating tidal system is discussed that was designed and deployed in Singapore towards tropical shallow water conditions through systematic resource assessment, device design through simulation and field based assessment. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

After applying stationarity and cointegration tests, the long term cointegration coefficients shall be determined with the help of the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) estimator. Granger causality estimation based on the vector error correction model (VECM) was applied to identify the causality relationship between the variables and to detect the direction of causality. Based on the identified causality relations, the Blue Economy has a significant influence on greenhouse gas emissions in the long run. Unidirectional causality relations were identified from the economic growth of greenhouse gas emissions in the long term, as well as from the greenhouse gas emissions on economic growth in the short term. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Blue Economy concept was firstly introduced after 2008 Mortgage Crisis, and gained importance in the United Nations Sustainability Conference held in Rio in 2012. In this study, the concept and the scope of the blue economy are given, and the fishing activity, which is one of the crucial blue economy components, is emphasized. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports, fish stocks are decreasing due to overfishing in the world. It has been suggested that fisheries support is leading to overfishing and to the reduction of fish stocks. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether fisheries support causes overfishing and whether it is a problem for sustainable fish resources. In the Python program, a production model was estimated to analyze the relationship between fisheries production and fisheries support, the number of vessels and the number of fishermen in 37 countries between the years 2012 and 2017. According to the model, it was observed that the fisheries support, the number of vessels and the number of fishermen increase fish production, but there is not a high correlation between the variables. In order to remove the overfishing pressure on fish production, it is important to shift the fisheries support to the support types which are indirectly related with the fish output. © 2020, Centenary University.

The key players were identified based on current annual production output and critical success factors, thus used as a benchmark for South Africa. Qualitative factors reviewed are critical success factors of the aquaculture sector of the selected countries that are widely germane to aquaculture development. These factors include production outputs (tons) and value ($); cultured species; prevalent aquaculture production systems; types of aquaculture, i.e., freshwater and mariculture; aquaculture development challenges related to fish seed, fish feed, land and water availability; aquaculture market and trade and provision of enabling environment through policies and frameworks. These factors were qualitatively reviewed and analyzed in ranking the aquaculture operations of the key players and South Africa to elucidate the critical success factors and challenges. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The management of marine and coastal regions requires a strategic approach that ensures minimal tension between the desire of regional economic development and the sustainable development of the coastal region. Blue growth was introduced as a catch-all approach to exploring and exploiting marine resources, however, approaches to blue growth varied due to ambiguity in how blue growth has been defined and applied. While the concept of blue growth has been used as a mechanism for the management of marine sectors, no concise universally adopted definition of blue growth exists which has resulted in the mismanagement of marine resources. This research defines blue growth as the sustainable development of marine resources, generating livelihoods, and securing well-being, from innovation in emerging marine sectors. With this definition of blue growth in mind, this research asks what are the influencing factors that nurture blue growth? To answer this question, this research leverages the findings of consultative stakeholder workshops in five coastal regions along the western Atlantic seaboard. The research shows that some of the nurturing factors include geography and absorptive capacity building to develop marine sectors sustainably. This research looks at blue growth development through the triple helix lens, focusing on how collaborative efforts between the stakeholders can be utilized to build absorptive capacities and identify commercial opportunities. Effectively utilizing blue growth strategies by targeting these antecedent factors could ensure a balanced approach to economic development and the sustainable development. Understanding the influencing factors of blue growths provides a pathway to overcoming the blue growth dilemma managing sustainable development and realizing commercial opportunities to ensure the development of a sustainable blue economy.  © 2021 MTS.},

	abstract = {Blue economy, which promotes sustainable usages of ocean resources for economic growth and development, as well as preservation of the health of ocean ecosystem, has become a crucial element of the broader ecosystem of sustainable and inclusive development. The desire to sustainably harness the potential of ocean and marine resources has been amply visible at the national and global level. Technological innovations, investment and multilateral cooperation have further been facilitating progress in the sectors of blue economy. Placed in a central position in the Indian Ocean and with a vast exclusive economic zone (EEZ), India has substantial potential for tapping marine resources and blue economy could emerge as the paradigm of development in the future. New Delhi has taken many initiatives to promote blue economy activities and development of modern infrastructure for greater connectivity, international collaboration and trade facilitation. Further, it is seeking wider multilateral cooperation in areas of financing, technology transfer, capacity building and knowledge sharing. This paper underlines the importance of blue economy in a broader framework of sustainable development and analyses India’s foreign policy orientation towards blue economy. Finally, it also discusses cooperation between India and European countries in the sectors of blue economy. © 2020, © 2020 National Maritime Foundation.},

Currently, fish aquaculture is driven by increasing global demand of fish, declining natural fisheries, food security and blue growth policies. At the same time, environmental policies such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive set tightening legal-ecological requirements for the industry's nutrient emissions. Against this background, the success of blue growth policies related to aquaculture – and the hope of reconciling competing interests at sea – boil down to measures available for dealing with excess nutrients. In line with the mitigation hierarchy, the article establishes four alternative pathways for the fish aquaculture industry to grow without increasing its environmental nutrient footprint significantly, and evaluates the legal adaptive capacity and the legal risks attached to these pathways. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Some relatively small countries have been considered to serve as facilitators for new ventures to exploit and explore the seabed and outer space. Luxembourg and Nauru could constitute two examples of such countries. Even though, it is common among industrialized states to establish obligations to share the benefits obtained from the exploitation of the seabed mining outside the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Countries like Luxembourg and its space mining legislation seem to point out that only the Moon Agreement, and not the Outer Space Treaty, designates space resources as common heritage. Therefore, one wonders whether “not sharing” could trigger an aggressive way of exploiting the seabed ignoring the applicable environmental law regime. The present paper suggests that the international community should respect and establish strong environmental bonds despite their extraterritorial expansion legal and policy regimes. The Working paper containing zero-draft of a “Space2030” agenda and its implementation plan, promotes Space as a driver of sustainable development. Therefore, the use of space in the global work for a sustainable ocean economy respects the environment and guarantees sustainability for future generations. With the advent of climate change a harmful effect against the environment the role of the space sector as a major driver of sustainable development could be considered as ineffective. © 2020 by DLR-SART.},

However, suitable wireless and mobile communications are lacking offshore. On the one hand, there is no coverage from terrestrial networks; on the other hand, satellite communications are still narrowband and expensive. Recently, the use of multi-hop airborne communications has been proposed to extend the coverage from terrestrial networks offshore but the communications range of these solutions is highly dependent on the height of the communications nodes. In this paper, we study the RF signal propagation in the maritime environment when the height of the receiver is changed and propose a position control approach for airborne multi-hop networks that maximizes the network capacity by taking full advantage of the signal reflections on the sea surface. The results obtained show that the proposed approach can provide lower propagation losses and higher network throughputs than random or fixed height approaches. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For many coastal nations in the Western Indian Ocean, and notably the islands of Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles, the tuna fishery is considered one of the main pillars of economic development, providing jobs and substantial revenues while ensuring food security. However, the fishery is also an illustration of the paradox behind the idea of the blue economy, where economic growth and sustainable use of resources are promoted as jointly achievable. We show that a sustainability narrative, in which the idea of fishing within ecological limits is present within government policy, public discourse, and practices, is, however, in contradiction with the realities of accumulation and growth that prevail in the fishery. When measures towards ecological preservation are to be taken, geopolitics of access to the sea and tuna enter the stage and change the position and narrative of the same actors, governments, and industrial actors that promote sustainability. We emphasize the difficult and nearly impossible path of practicing sustainability in the current model of growth-driven tuna fisheries. We argue for the need to repoliticize the practice of sustainability through the questioning of what we see in tuna fisheries: a hegemonic narrative of sustainability and implicit growth, without positive socio-ecological transformations. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Ocean governance has been portrayed as a challenge since the seas have many resources and valuable environmental features with interested parties across jurisdictions. Different types of ocean governance are recognised worldwide in countries ranging from law-centred practices to planning across set periods of time. Australia coasts and oceans have three layers of government with institutional arrangements across many layers of actors. Trends indicate uncertainty for many listed species, despite improving management in some areas, as reported in the Australian State of the Environment publications. Environmental governance has recently been used as a solution to deal with the scale of environmental problems of oceans and the associated blue economy. Environmental governance has dealt with processes of efficiency, effectiveness, institutional arrangements, social justice and capacity building, but much of this literature focuses on process and lacks an outcome and performance orientation. This paper presents a framework for environmental governance that addressed this lack of outcome and performance orientation. Examining the case study of marine reserves in Victoria, Australian insights are presented that may be significant for future ocean governance. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Blue Growth is the creation of economic activity and jobs at sea, while multiple use of space makes efficient use of the available sea area by combining industries. Clearly there are many combinations and many value propositions. However, most technologies to date are considered blue sky concepts, with little robust techno-economic analysis demonstrating profitability. The paper begins by providing a comprehensive review of Blue Growth and multi-use in Blue Growth; both in policy as well as the wide range of current technologies, including ocean energy, offshore wind energy, offshore aquaculture and desalination. The Maribe H2020 project provides the vehicle for the research element of the paper. The major contribution is a new methodology for selecting, filtering, developing and ranking business propositions for multiple-use of space (MUS) and multi-use platforms (MUP). Application of the method for the first time identified three case studies where Blue Growth combination projects can be economically viable, with attractive internal rate of return (IRRs). Results presented for the case studies report standard investment metrics and show the relative contribution of each product (energy, food, water) to the system profitability, as well as socio-economic impact. Existing companies were fully engaged in the process. Co-creation between sector experts and industry led to both improved business value propositions and robust assessment of investment readiness. In contrast to the presumption that large scale platforms are commercially attractive, the highest ranking case study companies required smaller capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operated in niche subsectors. In conclusion, the positive economic performance of the case studies should provide confidence for the EC as well as investors that MUS and MUP have viable economic futures leading towards commercialisation. The macro and micro assessment methods will be particularly useful in other Blue Economy contexts and in other multiple product contexts. © 2019 The Authors},

Although reports by international–and national–organisations suggest there are economic benefits to marine spatial planning this analysis has, to date, been aspatial. Employing an explorative Q methodology approach with ten participants, this paper seeks to address this spatial and distributive gap by exploring stakeholders (marine renewable energy, fishing industry, aquaculture and marine tourism) perceptions of the economic impacts of marine spatial planning across varying (local to national) geographical scales in the U.K. The paper develops a typology of three different perspectives on the economic impacts of marine spatial planning: the optimistic ‘place-makers’; the sceptical ‘place-holders’; and the utilitarian ‘place-less’. Findings highlight that participants loading onto a specific ‘type’ cannot simply be explained by stakeholder categorisation. This research contributes to the coastal management literature by identifying differing perceptions on the ‘spatial economic impact’ of marine spatial planning by economic actors utilising marine and coastal areas in the U.K. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Seafood production and trade have expanded dramatically over the last 40 years and comprise one of the fastest growing, and most environmentally impactful, sub-sectors of the global food system. While richer nations have increased their seafood consumption and displaced their environmental load, the marine environmental impact of fishery production has largely shifted to the waters of less-affluent nations. To sustain fishing economies and seafood security, in an era of increasing marine ecological precarity constitutes a major challenge for development and human well-being in the 21st century. Blue growth perspectives emphasize the transformative power of growth-oriented development. Such perspectives conflict with critical political economic theories of environment and food systems; notably, the treadmill of production and world food system scholarship. Using annual data from the Global Footprint Network, World Bank, UN FAO, and International Monetary Fund, this study applies methods in cross-national, panel regression analysis in order to ultimately pose some important challenges to modernist blue growth perspectives. The analysis suggests that economic growth and incorporation into the world market economy have led to unsustainable and inequitable outcomes regarding the marine ecological impact of fisheries. © 2022 by the Rural Sociological Society.},

	abstract = {The oceans are increasingly viewed as a new frontier for economic development. Yet, as companies and governments race to capitalize on marine resources, substantial risks can arise for people and the environment. The dominant discourse that frames blue growth as beneficial for the economy, developing nations, and coastal communities risks downplaying the uneven distribution of benefits and potential harms. Civil society organizations and academics alike have been sounding the alarm about the social justice implications of rapid and unchecked ocean development. Here, we review existing literature to highlight ten social injustices that might be produced by blue growth: 1) dispossession, displacement and ocean grabbing; 2) environmental justice concerns from pollution and waste; 3) environmental degradation and reduction of ecosystem services; 4) livelihood impacts for small-scale fishers; 5) lost access to marine resources needed for food security and well-being; 6) inequitable distribution of economic benefits; 7) social and cultural impacts; 8) marginalization of women; 9) human and Indigenous rights abuses; and, 10) exclusion from governance. Through this critical review, we aim to stimulate a rigorous dialogue on future pathways to achieve a more just and inclusive ocean economy. We contend that a commitment to ‘blue justice’ must be central to the blue growth agenda, which requires greater attention to addressing the 10 risks that we have highlighted, and propose practical actions to incorporate recognitional, procedural, and distributional justice into the future ocean economy. However, achieving a truly just ocean economy may require a complete transformation of the blue growth paradigm. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This research aimed to find out: The potential of Klatak Beach, Tulungagung Regency in the development of fishing tourism, the community empowerment in lobster fishing tourism, and the strategy for developing lobster fishing tourism in Klatak Beach to create Blue Economy. This research used descriptive methods with quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. The data used in this study are primary and secondary data, such as focus group discussions (FGD) with related parties. Secondary data were collected from government agencies, institutions, and the community. Data collection on this research was the primary data collected through interview and observation and also secondary data. Hierarchy Analysis Process (AHP) are used to create policy alternatives of Blue Economy. The results showed that Klatak Beach was potentially to develop as the tourism area. The empowerment on the Klatak Beach community has been done great by three groups of fishermen, namely Mina Klatak, Rayap Pereng, and Pereng Mania. The policy made by the fishermen group and the government of Tulungagung Regency has supported to create a blue economy. © 2020 Editura Universitatii din Oradea. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A new technology may be biased towards saving energy, or reducing pollution emission or increasing economic output. It is necessary for the high-quality development of marine economy to promote environment-based technological progress. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the biased technological progress and its influencing factors of China’s marine economy from 2002 to 2016. We used a DEA-Malmquist model to measure the biased technological progress. Then we further analyzed influencing factors of biased technological progress. Our research found that the TFP of the marine economy was basically growing, and this growth was mainly due to a positive impact of technological progress. In general, the technological progress of marine economy is gradually biased towards energy conservation and emissions reduction. Furthermore, technological progress in the Yangtze River Delta are more conducive to energy conservation. The marine economic production in the Pan-Pearl River Delta is more inclined to promote production growth, while tit is most concerned about environmental protection in the Bohai Rim region. In addition, factors such as environmental regulation, economic level, FDI and industrial scale have different impacts on biased technological progress of marine economy. The results show that the directive regulations have a greater impact on the input-biased technological progress, while the incentive regulations have a greater impact on the output-biased technological progress. Therefore, this study has important guiding significance for energy conservation and emission reduction of marine economy in China. And the green development path of China’s marine economy can provide a reference for the development of European blue economy. © 2020, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {According to the blue economy, recycling and reusing materials can be an innovative as well as productive venture. In particular in the building sector, which mostly affects the ecosystem, sustainable issues require the chance of employing resources from the wastes. A brief introduction about the wastes from the construction sector is outlined, including the idea that within pre-existing fabrics, management of wastes produced by the rehabilitation and completion works creates potential of conventional products’ reuse. A contribution is given to environmental cost of wastes’ conversion from C&D into resource: mainly of those products based on organic compounds employed in the building chain. The first part of the research develops in fact an analysis on economic and environmental scenario of management for C&D sector’s waste. The paper will then continue with the central subject: investigating the use of agricultural by-products in construction and how vegetable prime matter could be applied will be examined, mainly for the nonstructural external walls, as vertical closure, or internal partition. Some evaluation regarding the application of by-products will be presented, and a comparison will be shown between synthetic and vegetable C&D wastes, by means of data – run through LCA procedure – which are based on the indicator of emitted CO2, both by prime matter transformation processes and by disposal/conversion of the building-derived trash. The potential of some agricultural by-products will be analyzed, with European examples, enterprise’s experiences, and innovative start-ups promoted in south Italian regions. The correct management of agricultural by-products and their conversion into systems, products, or technologies, or more generally into materials for the building sector, allows to promote biological end of life for technical components of the building system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

The development of spatially distributed industries like marine renewables and aquaculture, the need for marine conservation, and the ongoing emphasis on spatial aspects of marine planning, have resulted in increasing encroachment into the marine environment. The study, situated in Scotland, investigates the attitudes of stakeholders who are affecting, or being affected by, these processes. The attitude analysis, done by Q methodology, highlights potentially conflicting priorities and processes. Five unique factors emerged. These are expressed as: free seas, the ‘greater good’, mitigating losses, local powers, and the status quo. The topography of views revealed demonstrates clear tensions between key players in Scotland's marine planning landscape, and calls into question the processes for effective collaborative working for sustainable and conflict-free development at sea. The paper concludes with an appeal for changes in rights to be accounted for in decision making processes, accompanied by better dissemination of information regarding rights at sea, governance and the future of the blue economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {US-based philanthropies have long contributed to environmental conservation through non-repayable donations, but some are now beginning to embrace novel investment strategies that are profit-orientated. From the vantage points of political economy and geopolitics, this article investigates the potential ramifications of this shift in funding for large-scale marine protected areas (LMPAs), which have been widely promoted to enhance marine biodiversity and manage sustainable fisheries. Specific attention is given to the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) in Kiribati, where finance from US-based philanthropic foundations is intended to support the operation and management of the LMPA and eventually compensate the government for forgone revenues from fishing licences, via the creation of a trust fund. Content analysis of key documents is conducted to empirically trace the political, legal, and financial evolution of PIPA. The findings demonstrate how, in accepting finance from philanthropic foundations, the government of Kiribati gradually relinquishes its decision-making leverage over PIPA's territory and resources. Hence, it is contended that certain legal and financial provisions could act as under-acknowledged and purposive drivers of ‘ocean-control grabbing’. Results further reveal that achieving financial sustainability for the PIPA conservation trust fund has proven difficult, opening up discussions on the extent to which PIPA could be capitalised in other ways. More broadly, the paper engages with recent debates on for-profit conservation, ocean grabbing, and the blue economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the midst of a global food crisis, the late 2000s saw tensions between rising food prices and demands for biofuels coalesce into a “food versus fuel” debate. In response to ensuing public outcries, governmental agencies, and researchers across the globe began mobilizing around alternative biofuel feedstock. Among these materials, algae emerged as the most “hopeful” sustainable alternative in producing biofuels. This article examines algal biofuel production systems designed offshore and integrated with wastewater treatment and carbon dioxide absorption processes to revitalize faith in biofuels in the blue economy. It discusses what makes algal biofuels sustainable by examining the ways practitioners talk about and design these integrated systems. Against the common refrain that algae’s photosynthetic and reproductive capacity makes these systems sustainable, this article underlines that there is nothing natural, innate, about algae to add to sustainable blue economies. Rather, algae become naturalized as biofuel source and bioremediation technologies through technoscientific discourses and interventions, which embed and reproduce anthropocentric approach to sustainability that centers on the ideology of growth. By drawing particular attention to the ways that integrated algal biofuel production systems depend on the constant generation of industrial waste, this article problematizes anthropocentric sustainability imaginaries and claims for imagining sustainability otherwise through the lens of blue degrowth to create a radical socio-ecological change. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Fisheries resources in vital freshwater ecosystems have been reported to be under immense threat, resulting in conflicts between conservation, management and exploitation. This study established requirements for identifying and mapping fish breeding and nursery grounds in such ecosystems in the Kenyan part of Lake Victoria. The criteria were characterised by the use of indigenous knowledge, field data, literature on breeding sites, macroinvertebrates distribution, larval and relative fish abundances, digitisation, participatory mapping, and periodic sampling. Data were collected from trawl and seine net surveys. Digitisation and mapping of the proposed conservation sites were carried out using Quantum GIS software. Participatory physical demarcation of sites was done using buoys and markers. Larval and juvenile fishes were diverse and abundant in all seven river mouths and six bays surveyed with little variance; an important aspect of breeding areas. Additionally, a preponderance of macroinvertebrates and high fish diversity compared with offshore sites in the lake strengthened the hypothesis that these are critical habitats for spawning and preferred habitats for nurseries for fish. The approach can be adopted globally to guarantee the long-term integrity of critical fish habitats for sustainable fisheries management and blue growth. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Shipping carries virtually all internationally traded goods. Major commercial ports are fully integrated into transnational production and distribution systems, enabling the circulation of massive flows of energy and materials in the global economy. Port activity and development are usually associated with positive socio-economic effects, such as increased GDP and employment, but the industry’s continuous expansion produces adverse outcomes including air and water pollution, the destruction of marine and coastal environments, waterfront congestion, health risks, and labor issues. In its quest to marry economic growth and environmental sustainability in the maritime industries, proponents of the newly coined blue growth paradigm assume the negative impacts of ports and shipping to be fixable mostly through technological innovation. This paper questions the validity of the premise that the unlimited growth of the port and shipping industries is compatible with environmental sustainability and analyses the feasibility of technological improvements to offset the sector’s associated negative impacts. Based on insights from ecological economics and political ecology, ports can be described as power-laden assemblages of spaces, flows, and actors, which produce unequally distributed socio-ecological benefits and burdens at multiple scales. Focusing on the case of the Port of Barcelona, this study argues that the continuous expansion of port activity increases seldom accounted-for negative socio-environmental impacts, acquiring an uneconomic character for port cities and regions. In contrast, de-growth is presented as a radical sustainability alternative to ocean-based growth paradigms. The paper concludes by discussing its prospective ‘blue’ articulation in the context of maritime transportation while offering some avenues for future research and policymaking. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The expansion of industrial fishing via technological advancements and heavy subsidies in the Global North has been a significant factor leading to the current global fishery crisis. The growth of the industrial fleet led to an initial increase in global catches from the 1950s to the 1990s; yet, today, several marine fish stocks are harvested at unsustainable rates, and catches are stagnating. As a result, industrial fishers increase investments and fishing effort, reaching farther and deeper, while small-scale fishers face the threat of disappearance as both their catches and livelihoods worsen. The emergent international emphasis on Blue Growth is likely to put further pressure on marine capture fisheries. This paper explores how the growth imperative in the seas has manifested itself in Turkey since the 1970s and how industrial and small-scale fishers responded to this growth spiral in the seas. Based on participant observation methods and in-depth interviews, this paper problematizes the expanding boundaries of industrial fishers and examines the reactions of small-scale fishing cooperatives in Istanbul, in particular their proposed alternative economic model, as a response to the growth imperative. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the crisis that small-scale fishers are facing not only presents economic and ecological difficulties, but also represents an existential threat to the identity and traditional ways of life as a fisher. The strategies adopted by small-scale fishers in response to this crisis in Turkey, especially in Istanbul, are politicizing fishers as they open up new spaces, collaborations, and demands for environmental, social, and economic justice. However, their efforts constitute an ongoing process prone to numerous tensions and contradictions. This paper concludes that challenging the growth paradigm in fisheries via the Blue Degrowth framework can be useful for analyzing emerging alternative imaginaries to the growth-driven capitalist economic system among small-scale fishers. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {There is currently no generally accepted definition for the “blue economy,” despite the term becoming common parlance over the past decade. The concept and practice have spawned a rich, and diverse, body of scholarly activity. Yet despite this emerging body of literature, there is ambiguity around what the blue economy is, what it encapsulates, and its practices. Thus far, the existing literature has failed to theorise key geographical concepts such as space, place, scale, and power relations, all of which have the potential to lead to uneven development processes and regional differentiation. Previous research has sought to clarify the ontological separation of land and sea or has conceptualised the blue economy as a complex governmental project that opens up new governable spaces and rationalises particular ways of managing marine and coastal regions. More recently, geographers have called for a critical—and practical—engagement with the blue economy. This paper critically examines the existing literature of the geographies of the blue economy through a structured meta-analysis of published work, specifically its conceptualisations and applications to debates in the field. Results offer the potential to ground a bottom-up definition of the blue economy. In so doing, this paper provides a clearly identifiable rubric of the key geographical concepts that are often overlooked by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners when promoting economic development and technological innovation in coastal and marine environments. © 2019 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Since the 1980s phycological research efforts have been made in the Macaronesian Region, largely focusing on the floristics and systematics of those macroalgae present at the archipelagos of the Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries, and Cabo Verde Islands. Major publications from those studies have allowed cataloging the diversity of macroalgae growing along their volcanic coastlines, but have also described the historical and current uses of some seaweeds. Perhaps most importantly, potential industrial applications from selected seaweeds could result in novel economic resources and income generation as key elements of the Blue Economy Strategies in the region. This review presents the seaweed resources from the Macaronesia Region, which collectively includes 52 taxa, of which—9 greens, 14 browns, and 29 reds are cataloged. Some geographic areas, e.g., the Cabo Verde Islands and Madeira, require more intense field research in order to investigate selected, target seaweeds of interest which may become new marine resources for commercial exploitation. Future development of this emerging marine biotechnological sector will depend on the sustainable management of wild stocks, as well as implementation of culture techniques for biomass production, adapted to the environmental and socio-economic conditions of the respective archipelagos. In parallel, capacity building actions are foreseen to boost the large potential of Macaronesian seaweeds as key elements of the local Blue Economy. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The Blue Economy is an ocean based economic growth model gaining traction around the world. The way in which the Blue Economy is conceived and understood differs significantly across different sets of actors. A particular area of contestation exists around which ocean based industries or sectors can be considered to be ‘Blue’. This highlights the possibility of the Blue Economy becoming a forum through which the legitimacy of different private uses of ocean resources is contested and debated. The question of legitimacy of Blue Economy activities and sectors is explored through a critical engagement with the notion of a ‘social license to operate’ (SLO). Whilst SLO is normally considered in the context of individual businesses or developments, in this article we explore the applicability of SLO at a cross-sectoral scale. In doing so we examine how the concept of SLO may inform debates over appropriate private use of public ocean resources, and how this might influence the legitimacy of the broader concept of a Blue Economy. A case study involving a range of private sectors actors engaged in diverse ocean industries was conducted, drawing on interviews, a cross-sectoral survey and an interactive workshop with the ocean business community. The case study explores the role that SLO is currently playing in ocean industries. In particular we explore perceptions of who grants a SLO, what kind of concerns impact a SLO and how sectors work to obtain, or maintain, a SLO. By comparing the responses of individual sectors to these three critical questions, we identify that many of the SLO challenges currently being experienced by ocean industries relate to conflicting social and political values. This is creating a range of complex, sometimes irresolvable, SLO challenges for maritime industries, largely concentrated in sectors engaged in resource extraction, such as mining and oil and gas. In addition we find that attempts to address SLO challenges to date focus mostly on technical or technological adaptations. When comparing this to Blue Economy narratives we find that current engagement with SLO speaks primarily to interpretations of the Blue Economy which favour growth based narratives, and largely neglect competing discourses. This has considerable implications for the overall legitimacy of the Blue Economy, as the loss of SLO within one sector may undermine the credibility of the concept overall. This research highlights the importance of broader societal and political engagement in questions about appropriate use and management of private sector activities in the ocean. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic triggered a large-scale global crisis that affected the economy of the European Union. The purpose of the study is to assess the impact of crisis on the state and prospects of the EU's maritime economic activities. The affected maritime sectors are associated with the Blue Economy concept as a new environmentally-oriented format of the Maritime Economy. The analysis revealed that this included coastal tourism, fisheries, aquaculture, port activities, and maritime transport. Several sectors, including coastal tourism and aquaculture, ensure the implementation of a long-term Blue Growth strategy. The article identifies factors that affect the prospects of the EU's Blue Economy in unfavorable conditions. Some of them may have a negative impact on the implementation projects in the maritime sector and cause additional economic threats. Meanwhile, the European Union plans to solve a wide range of problems associated with new approaches to maritime management. This idea demonstrates the importance of the Maritime Economy and the Blue Economy for the EU, as well as possible directions for the restoration and development of maritime activities. First of all, this concerns the allocation of targeted assistance to the fisheries and aquaculture in the context of ensuring food security. In addition, the Blue Economy should facilitate the recovery of the EU economy in the post-crisis period, as well as contribute to the implementation of the European Green Deal. © 2020 Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Globally there has been recognition that there is little consensus attributed to the definition of the blue economy. However, despite this acknowledgement, the blue economy is championed for its development potential by the African Union and subsequently, several African states. Having formalised the agenda in its fifth National Development Plan Namibia is working to implement a governance and management framework to “sustainably maximise benefits from marine resources” by 2020 (Republic of Namibia in Namibia’s 5th National Development Plan (NDP5) 2017). Concurrently, new entrants, such as marine mineral mining projects, have emerged in recognition of the potential offered within the state’s Exclusive Economic Zone. This article argues that the uptake of the blue economy is shaped by multiple, and often conflicting, interests. The emergence of the agenda is not apolitical, nor has it been established in isolation from exogenous actors and interests. Subsequently, this article suggests that the critique of the emerging blue economy should be applied to discussions of a blue degrowth movement, to avoid transposing a new agenda over another. As demonstrated with reference to Namibia, contextual and historical issues need to be recognised by degrowth discussions, and their inherent and continued structural effects analysed. This is of particular importance when considering whose voices are represented or excluded by such agendas, complicated by the (geo)physical characteristics of the marine sphere. © 2019, The Author(s).},

This paper assesses the directions followed by the research and innovation activities performed by Portuguese organisations in the fields encompassed by the "Blue Economy", at the light of national and EU strategies. It analyses the projects developed by Portuguese actors in the context of European framework programmes to uncover: the areas privileged - namely the relative importance of emerging areas vs. new advances targeting established ones - and the relative position of different types of organisations in the developments taking place. The results point to stronger efforts in system domains related to marine resources and the marine environment and in some industry oriented domains. Among the latter, emerge new industries such as marine biotechnology and marine renewable energies and established industries exploiting marine living resources (fisheries, aquaculture). The results highlight the prominent position of research organisations in both new and established areas, as well as the relevant position of new technology intensive firms, in areas that require the development of application-oriented activities, where they often intermediate between research and industry. The results suggest that the international cooperation favoured by these projects permitted to open-up the national system, contributing to broaden the organisations' knowledge bases and to extend their international networks. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {During a 18-week experiment in a sea-based system, Paracentrotus lividus was fed with two formulations of a new sustainable feed whose main ingredients were food farming discards, mostly outermost lettuce leaves, in different percentage. Egg white was added as protein source and binder, and a little amount of commercial fish feed was added as lipid source. At the end of the experiment, a high survival rate (>80%) and an increase in test diameter (22%), total weight (130%), gonad weight (240%) and gonad index expressed as size-adjusted gonad weight (288%) were recorded. Gonads achieved a good colour and high levels of essential and polyunsaturated fatty acids, hence representing a commercially valuable product. Comparing the two feed formulations, the one with the lower lettuce content (57% vs. 67%) led to the best product quality, in terms of gonad features (gonad index and colour) and content of essential fatty acids. In order to move towards a higher sustainability of the aquaculture sector, this study proposes a low-cost feed, produced with cheap and sustainable ingredients such as food farming discards. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {European Union (EU) strategy on blue growth has directed interest in the debate on utilizing marine resources. At the same time, EU Member States are taking the first steps in doing maritime spatial planning (MSP). For strategic planning such as MSP and prioritizing future investments, governments and policy makers are in need of economic indicators for the blue economy. Although in all parts of the world the sea has traditionally been the driver for the growing economy, research on the economic value of the blue economy has been limited. However, when MSP is becoming the norm, evaluating the existing blue economy becomes more important. In this paper, the economic significance of blue economies is estimated for the Gulf of Bothnia (GoB) region of Finland. By conducting a case study on the current situation of the blue economy in a specific region it is possible to bring the discussion of blue growth to a practical and local level. The GoB was seen as a potential area to study blue growth or the blue economy because of the already existing active maritime sector and the relatively pristine environment. The core problems of defining and quantifying multi-sector resources such as the blue economy will be discussed, and comprehensive data to scrutinize the blue economy sector in the GoB will be provided. This study stresses the importance of local economic data to be able to understand the potential of blue economies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data from 1995 to 2018 have been used for the analysis of eight countries. The contributing factors that measure the fishing production are total aquaculture production, total fisheries production and agriculture, forestry and fishing. Trade and the rate of inflation are used as control variables. Using the feasible generalized least square technique. Findings: It was found that the blue economy factors play a statistically significant role in the economic growth of SAARC countries and contribute to the achievement of Goal 14 of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals: to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Originality/value: This study highlights the fact that proper management and utilization of water resources may assist the stimulation of economic growth and meet the challenges of food insecurity by improving the supply of seafood in developing South Asian countries. The study proposes that the sustainable management of water resources requires an alliance across nation states. The alliance will be useful in understanding the concept of the blue economy and the role it plays in ensuring economic growth in developing nations throughout the world. © 2020, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.},

	abstract = {The blue economy is a dynamic and rapidly growing movement that captures the interplay between economic, social, and ecological sustainability of the ocean and encompasses numerous maritime sectors and activities (e.g., commerce and trade; living resources; renewable energy; minerals, materials, and freshwater; and ocean health and data). The demand for ocean data to inform scientific, risk reduction, and national security needs is leading to a large increase in the number of deployed ocean observation and monitoring systems, most of which require increased power. Because ocean observation systems are often placed in remote locations, they primarily rely on energy storage (or in some cases in situ energy generation) to power instruments and equipment, which imposes limits on sampling rates, deployment times, and spatiotemporal resolution of data. The U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies Office is exploring the potential for marine renewable energy (MRE) devices (largely wave and tidal energy converters) to provide power to support multiple blue economy opportunities. A portion of these opportunities focus on power at sea markets for providing power in off-grid and offshore locations to support a variety of ocean-based activities, including ocean observation and navigation, underwater vehicle charging, marine aquaculture, marine algae farming, and seawater mining. Initially, research has focused on better understanding how and where MRE can provide a consistent source of reliable power to extend ocean observing missions, including operation of autonomous underwater vehicles. Online surveys as well as phone and in-person interviews were conducted with experts in the field of ocean observing systems and observatories to gather end-user requirements, determine energy needs, identify opportunities for codevelopment, and pinpoint constraints for MRE to meet those needs. The surveys and interviews provided feedback on the potential for powering devices and vehicles using MRE, including identifying common themes and challenges that will inform foundational research and development steps needed to advance the integration of MRE with ocean observing systems. In most cases, additional power generation on the order of watts was identified as significantly beneficial to enhancing ocean observations capabilities. © 2019 Marine Technology Society.},

	abstract = {The deep sea is the vastest environment on Earth and provides many services and goods. Understanding the services and goods of deep-sea ecosystems would enable better resource governance and decision-making. In the present study, we reviewed and assessed deep-sea ecosystems services using the Ma conceptual framework, which incorporates ecosystems services and goods with human welfare. We also analyzed and measured the scientific production between 2012 and 2021 using the Dimension dataset. The bibliometric analysis showed a lack of studies related to deep-sea ecosystem services, which suggest the urgent need to overcome the existing knowledge gap regarding deep-sea components. However, the current knowledge revealed the crucial role that these ecosystems provide to the planet. Furthermore, we highlighted that there are common services and goods, and every ecosystem service feeds into another one. Developing actions and policies based on approaches that combine all deep-sea ecosystems services and goods are needed for the sustainable growth of the deep-sea economy in accordance with the United Nations Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Throughout the world there is evidence of mounting interest in marine resources and new maritime industries to create jobs, economic growth and to help in the provision of energy and food security. Expanding populations, insecurity of traditional sources of supply and the effects of climate change add urgency to a perceived need to address and overcome the serious challenges of working in the maritime environment. Four promising areas of activity for 'Blue Growth' have been identified at European Union policy level including Aquaculture; Renewable Energy (offshore wind, wave and tide); Seabed Mining; and Blue Biotechnology. Work has started to raise the technological and investment readiness levels (TRLs and IRLs) of these prospective industries drawing on the experience of established maritime industries such as Offshore Oil and Gas; Shipping; Fisheries and Tourism. An accord has to be struck between policy makers and regulators on the one hand, anxious to direct research and business incentives in effective and efficient directions, and developers, investors and businesses on the other, anxious to reduce the risks of such potentially profitable but innovative investments. The EU H2020 MARIBE (Marine Investment for the Blue Economy) funded project was designed to identify the key technical and non-technical challenges facing maritime industries and to place them into the social and economic context of the coastal and ocean economy. MARIBE went on to examine with companies, real projects for the combination of marine industry sectors into multi-use platforms (MUPs). The purpose of this book is to publish the detailed analysis of each prospective and established maritime business sector. Sector experts working to a common template explain what these industries are, how they work, their prospects to create wealth and employment, and where they currently stand in terms of innovation, trends and their lifecycle. The book goes on to describe progress with the changing regulatory and planning regimes in the European Sea Basins including the Caribbean where there are significant European interests. The book includes: Experienced chapter authors from a truly multidisciplinary team of sector specialisms First extensive study to compare and contrast traditional Blue Economy with Blue Growth Complementary to EU and National policies for multi-use of maritime space. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.

	abstract = {Geospatial data is essential for the development of the blue economy: for sustainable coastal management of coastal areas and to unlock economic potential from marine and ocean resources. In developing countries, such as South Africa, there are often gaps in the data with significant implications for the blue economy. We conducted a project aimed at addressing these data gaps by experimenting with a circular process where geospatial data for selected areas on the South African coastline were collected through mapathons and used in applications that were developed during hackathons. We validated this circular approach with two iterations of mapathons and hackathons, and found that 1) the size and location of the map area need to be carefully chosen; 2) those creating the apps needed a huge amount of help in dealing with the geospatial data; and 3) any geospatial data is useful for the blue economy, not only data with a very specific purpose in the blue economy context, such as coastal access points. Overall, the geospatial data usability improved from one iteration to another and would certainly improve if more iterations were added. Similar to the deployment of mapathons for disaster relief, future research could focus on hosting hackathons for the rapid development of apps to assist with disaster relief operations. Generally, the hosting of mapathons and hackathons in lockstep is a novel way of exposing students to interdisciplinary collaboration in international teams with a common goal. © Authors 2019.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, nations and regions are increasingly advancing their oceans or blue economies to expand their economic growth and food and energy security through the growth of established marine sectors, the expansion of historically terrestrial sectors into the marine space, or as emergent sector technologies advance marine resource accessibility. Such ocean economy sectoral expansions are in many cases limited to the coastal or shallow shelf regions of a country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) resulting in considerable potential for inter-sectoral and / or sectoral-environmental conflict in these regions. Concurrent indirect pressures (e.g. climate change or ocean acidification) arising from increasing human resource consumption potentially further erode the function of ocean ecosystems which provide the ecosystem service foundations of many ocean economy goods and services. Ocean governance policy formulation requires trade-offs that are valuation dependent across the economic, social and environmental domains for the mitigation of both inter-sectoral and sectoral-environmental conflicts and sustainable and equitable resource use encapsulated within the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Maritime safety and security are critical within such governance frameworks and are both enablers of the blue economy (through asset and revenue protection) and a potential sectoral source of economic development and growth within blue economies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {The ‘blue economy’ has in recent years become a leading concept for envisioning what may come after the fossil-based era. In efforts at calculating the potential economic value of the ocean, policy-oriented documents seek to unite diverse actors around common goals. Through the calculation of numbers, large-scale and long-term policy visions are being crystallized. But how do such numbers come into being in practice? This article interrogates this question with an example from the Norwegian context: the established policy goal of a so-called ‘five-fold increase’ in marine value creation in the year 2050. While powerful numbers are commonly expected to be produced through the procedures of ‘mechanical objectivity’ that involve strict quantification and scientific methods, our analysis shows a rather different route towards a powerful number: By loosely combining tools developed for business management, the number is calculated by, first, openly combining qualitative and narrative operations into the calculation and then, next, decoupling qualitative uncertainties from the quantified potential. The result is a calculative process that takes the form of what we suggest to call ‘reflexive objectivity’ and a policy-oriented number that encourages risk-taking and action over restraint and precaution. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Small-scale fisheries in Kenya contribute about 4.7% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in spite of high post-harvest losses. Post-harvest interventions in fisheries enable fishers and fish processors to reduce waste, maintain nutritional aspects and meet stringent demands in food quality and safety. This review highlights the benefits and pitfalls of various fish post-harvest management interventions in order to drive policy dialogue and formulation of a regulatory framework for future interventions. It relies on data obtained from the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute and the State Department of Fisheries and Blue Economy. Results depict abundant interventions in both handling and processing, but low utilization (<40% of installed cold rooms, dryers and smoking kilns) and multiplication by fishing communities. Fish products that target export markets have well-organized structures. However, a weak regulatory framework is a key constraint in addressing post-harvest management of fish intended for the domestic market. Under-utilization of installed interventions results in continued waste of fish, contributing to food and nutritional insecurity. This review recommends the development of an effective and integrative policy framework that involves interactions across different domains, institutional mechanisms that monitor and address those interactions, analytical bases for decision making, and multi-stakeholder dialogue for post-harvest management. Such policies will enhance the adoption of post-harvest technology in small-scale fisheries in Kenya and elsewhere. © 2019, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {How can countries identify comparable competitors and find like-minded partners in the international trade market of blue products to achieve better blue economic growth? This paper maps the “Blue Country Space” (BCS) based on the differences in the export capacity of blue products possessed by countries and decomposes it through the hierarchical structure analysis of complex network, dividing countries into different hierarchies. The results demonstrate that countries with leading positions in the international trade market of blue products are at higher hierarchies in BCS, as evidenced by their diversification and comprehensiveness of blue products of different complexity. The paper therefore argues that better blue economic growth also implies a cascade leap in BCS. Countries should not voluntarily give up their original low-complexity blue products to achieve better development. They can also establish long-term trade partnerships through regional cooperation to enter higher hierarchies together with members in the same hierarchy. Different hierarchies reflect the differences in blue product portfolios of different complexity. Countries in the same hierarchy become the most direct competitors due to they have similar blue product export capabilities. While the competition between countries in adjacent hierarchies is relatively weak. There is no obvious competition between non-adjacent hierarchies, which tend to be more trade complementary. These findings suggest that the BCS can be used as a useful additional policy analysis tool. Each economy can use this tool to analyze differences with comparative foreign competitors. Learning from the experience of higher-hierarchy countries in managing ocean and coast industries, leading to reflections on the development of its own blue industrial structure, and contributing to the formulation of blue industrial policies by policymakers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In response to the growing need for sustainable marine tourism, this paper proposes the future Marina Sustainable Development planning, as a means to develop approaches and strategies that support sustainable planning, blue economy and management of recreational ports and marinas in countries with extensive coastlines, such as East Coast Peninsular Malaysia. It is important to note that applying such a future planning has not always been an easy task due to the fact that managers in this field have not been particularly familiar with its importance of the sustainability marine tourism, blue economy and it is highly topical and timely to apply the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and blue economy approach in order to highlight the current situation in terms of existing capacities in environmental standard implementation, thus comprehending the level of sustainable practices in the country. The sustainable development of Marina described here, includes targets and goals pertinent to the implementation of directives and best practices which confirm that a marina has all the capacities and conditions to operate in an environmentally friendly manner. It is proposed that in order to offer services in the era of sustainability, marinas must adopt a SDG based on identifying and managing environmental issues and balance between people, profit and planet. Also, this paper addresses challenges facing SDG implementation to become green marina in the future. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.},

	abstract = {Ocean- and coastal-based economic activities are increasingly recognised as key drivers for supporting global economies. This move towards the “blue economy” is becoming globally widespread, with the recognition that if ocean-based activities are to be sustainable, they will need to move beyond solely extractive and exploitative endeavours, aligning more closely with marine conservation and effective marine spatial planning. In this paper we define the “blue economy” as a “platform for strategic, integrated and participatory coastal and ocean development and protection that incorporates a low carbon economy, the ecosystem approach and human well-being through advancing regional industries, services and activities”. In Peru, while the seas contribute greatly to the national economy, the full potential of the blue economy has yet to be realised. This paper presents the findings of an early career scientist workshop in Lima, Peru, in March 2016. The workshop “Advancing Green Growth in Peru” brought together researchers to identify challenges and opportunities for green growth across three Peruvian economic sectors—tourism, transport and the blue economy with this paper exploring in detail the priorities generated from the “blue economy” stream. These priorities include themes such as marine spatial planning, detailed evaluations of existing maritime industries (e.g. guano collection and fisheries), development of an effective MPA network, support for sustainable coastal tourism, and better inclusion of social science disciplines in understanding societal and political support for a Peruvian blue economy. In addition, the paper discusses the research requirements associated with these priorities. While not a comprehensive list, these priorities provide a starting point for future dialogue on a co-ordinated scientific platform supporting the blue growth agenda in Peru, and in other regions working towards a successful “blue economy”. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This article explores the politics behind the promise of ‘blue growth’. Reframing it as a ‘blue fix’, we argue that the blue growth discourse facilitates new opportunities for capital accumulation, while claiming that this accumulation is compatible with social and ecological aims as well. The blue fix is made up of three underlying sub-fixes. First of all, the conservation fix quenches the social thirst for action in the face of climate change. Here we see how protecting marine areas can be an important part of mitigating climate change, but in practice, gains at the national level are overshadowed by the ongoing expansion of offshore drilling for oil and gas. Second, the protein fix satisfies the growing global demand for healthy food and nutrition through the expansion of capital-intensive large-scale aquaculture, while ignoring the negative socio-ecological impacts, which effectively squeeze small-scale capture fishing out, while industrial capture fishing remains well positioned to expand into as well as supply industrial aquaculture with fish feed from pelagic fish. And third, an energy fix offers a burst of wind energy and a splash of new deep-sea minerals without disturbing the familiar and persistent foundation of oil and gas. This dimension of the blue fix emphasizes the transition to wind and solar energy, but meanwhile the deep sea mining for minerals required by these new technologies launches us into unknown ecological territories with little understood consequences. The synergy of these three elements brought together in a reframing of ocean politics manifests as a balancing act to frame blue growth as ‘sustainable’ and in everyone’s interest, which we critically analyze and discuss in this article. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

This requires recognition of the importance of MCH as a knowledge base amongst marine ocean scientists, policy makers and marine stakeholders on the one hand and a greater effort by marine heritage specialists to engage with the 2030 Agenda on the other. The forthcoming UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) provides an opportunity to engage with the sea more widely but it is argued that the cultural element provided by considering past human action is currently lacking. The importance of understanding human interaction with the sea in terms of gaining a more complete picture of human history is briefly presented and a definition of MCH as all past action in the human zone is given. The article then sets out how MCH can enhance sustainable development in the marine zone with particular reference to SDG14 considering heritage tourism, coastal development and infrastructure, development aid policy, climate change, coastal management, fisheries and the offshore industry. The article highlights that the knowledge and data from MCH should be seen as crucial in evidence-based decision making across the coastal and marine sectors. The paper concludes that the inclusion of MCH approaches in initiatives aiming at coastal and ocean sustainability is not just advisable-it is essential. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing food sector in the world and the open oceans are seen as one of the most likely areas for large-scale expansion [1], [2], [3]. The global demand for seafood is continuing to rise sharply, driven by both population growth and increased per capita consumption, whilst wild-capture fisheries are constrained in their potential to produce more seafood. A recently funded EC project, the Blue Growth Farm - BGF (GA n. 774426, 1st June 2018 - 30th September 2021) aims at contributing to this world need with an original solution. The Blue Growth Farm proposes an efficient, cost-competitive and environmentally friendly multi-purpose offshore farm concept. It is based on a modular floating structure, moored to the seabed, meeting requirements of efficiency, cost-competitiveness and environmental friendless, where automated aquaculture and renewable energy production systems are integrated and engineered for profitable applications in the open sea. In the present paper, the overall engineering approach developed to carry out the research work is presented, described and justified. Different technical and scientific challenges are addressed through an integrated industrial engineering design approach, where all disciplines are tuned to achieve the Blue Growth Farm main targets. These are represented by: i) guaranteeing expected nominal fish production thanks to advanced automation and remote control capabilities; ii) minimizing the pollution introduced at marine ecosystem level when exploiting the marine natural resources, whilst increasing the social acceptance and users community agreement; iii) maximizing the electricity production in the Blue Growth Farm potential installation area ecosystem to provide energy supply to the on-board electrical equipment and to dispatch the extra produced electric energy to the land network. Preliminary engineering design results are promising to demonstrate effective increase of safety and efficiency by reducing on-board human effort and consequently risks at offshore, thus to make commercial-scale open ocean farming a reality.

This paper aims to identify dominating ideologies and strategies of Blue Growth in the Faroe Islands, mainly regarding salmon farming and industrial capture fisheries, and to investigate how these ideologies materialize in the social metabolism of Faroese society. The analysis approaches the Faroese Blue Economy from a holistic perspective using analytical concepts and frameworks of social (island) metabolism, environmental justice and degrowth to assess how current Blue Growth strategies pertain to long-term sustainability and human well-being. It offers a critical analysis of aquaculture in the Faroe Islands and shows that although the rhetoric around Blue Growth is framed within mainstreamed sustainability discourse, the ideologies and visions underpinning current Blue Growth strategies result in a continuation of conventional growth through the exploitation of new commodity frontiers. Finally, the negative consequences of Blue Growth are assessed and discussed through a mapping of recent and ongoing social and ecological distribution conflicts in the Faroes. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Since 2011, when the first European ocean literacy (OL) project was launched in Portugal, the number of initiatives about this topic in Europe has increased notoriously and their scope has largely widened. These initiatives have drawn from the seven “OL Principles” that were developed by the College of Exploration OL Network in 2005. They represent a source of inspiration for the many endeavors that are aiming to achieve a society that fully understands the influence of themselves – as individuals and as a population – on the ocean and the influence of the ocean on them. OL initiatives throughout the past years, globally, have resulted in the production of countless didactic and communication resources that represent a valuable legacy for new activities. The OL research community recognizes the need to build up the scope of OL by reaching the wider Blue Economy actors such as the maritime industrial sector. It is hoped that building OL in this sector will contribute to the long-term sustainable development of maritime activities. The ERASMUS+ project “MATES” aims to address the maritime industries’ skills shortages and contribute to a more resilient labor market. MATES’ hypothesis is that through building OL in educational, professional and industrial environments, it is possible to build a labor force that matches the skills demand in these sectors and increases their capacity to uptake new knowledge. The MATES partnership will explicitly combine OL and knowledge transfer by applying the “COLUMBUS Knowledge Transfer Methodology” as developed by the H2020-funded COLUMBUS project. © Copyright © 2019 Fernández Otero, Bayliss-Brown and Papathanassiou.},

	abstract = {The term “green growth” and its sister concepts, “blue-green growth,” the “green economy,” and the “blue-green economy,” have gained considerable traction in the Pacific island region in a short space of time. Pacific island governments, regional organisations, and development agencies all use the terms, which originate outside of the Pacific. What (and who) has driven the adoption of green growth terminology within the region? How has its usage in the region mirrored international usage? This paper presents findings from research on the vernacularisation of green growth terminology in Fiji and Vanuatu. We find a contested policy space, where Pacific actors deploy competing meanings of green growth terms in ways that both reflect their worldviews and support their agendas. This diversity has helped to underpin the rapid spread of green growth terminology in the region, while differentiating it from international usage. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {The construction of discourse through choice of wording and sentence structure can affect power relations between people and groups. Social license to operate (SLO), broadly defined as the public’s acceptance or approval of a company and its operations, is an emergent concept in New Zealand’s marine economy. The way the public discourse around SLO is constructed and communicated can empower some at the expense of others, whether deliberately or inadvertently. This study employed critical discourse analysis to investigate how SLO is used in public documents relating to commercial activities in New Zealand’s marine environment between 1996 and 2017. Specifically, the study explores the implied power relations between government, industry, New Zealand’s Indigenous tribes (hereafter, iwi), communities, and other stakeholders. We find that industry and central government dominate SLO-related public discourse, and they frequently vest SLO agency with industry rather than community groups, iwi, or the wider public. Indeed, iwi are largely absent from the SLO discourse in public documents. Definitions of SLO vary extensively across the documents and are largely captured by industry and central government. We conclude that New Zealand’s marine SLO public discourse empowers industry at the expense of communities and the public, contrary to the notional intent of the concept. © 2020 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Scuba diving continues to be one of the most popular recreational activities in marine tourism, but its sustainability is currently threatened due to environmental, social, political, and economic risks. The East African Marine Ecoregion is renowned for its richness in marine fauna and flora, including some of the Indian Ocean's most diverse and abundant coral reef ecosystems, making it a popular destination for scuba divers. However, empirical evidence suggests that external risks (international and domestic) are impacting on dive operators in the region, creating the need to better understand these impacts. This research was therefore aimed at identifying the most significant of these external risks from the perspective of dive operators, via an explorative and descriptive study. The qualitative and quantitative primary data collected revealed that domestic and international economic and political risks have the greatest impact on dive operators in the East African Marine Ecoregion, and this trend is expected to continue. Environmental degradation of coral reefs, while not seen as a threat to dive operators at present, constitutes a key threat within the near future. In terms of the variation in perceived risk across the region, Kenya suffers most from social and political risks, Tanzania from environmental risks, Mozambique from political risks, and South Africa from economic risks. The research contributes to Africa's Blue Economy, which aims to guide African countries in sustainable use of the marine environment while harnessing its social and economic benefits. The findings create awareness of the impact of external risks on regional dive operators and their significance. Furthermore, they create an opportunity for decision makers and stakeholders in the region to craft solutions to improve the sustainability of the scuba diving industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

As aquaculture intensifies, there is increasing pressure to find more sustainable practices that save resources and reduce waste. Major wastes and by-products from aquaculture were quantified across a full range of farming types. Key opportunities for wastewater treatment and by-product recovery include nutrient recycling through a combination of biofilters, bioaccumulation and multitrophic systems. To support a sustainable intensification of aquaculture, improvements in by-product harvesting, accumulation and processing methods require further investigation. Likewise, energy generated from by-products can potentially support intensified production through land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Future challenges faced by the reuse of side streams include control of food safety and gaining consumer acceptance. Combined with increases in resource use efficiency across the aquaculture sector, from feeding methodologies to product storage, nutrient recycling can enable aquaculture to contribute sustainably toward the nutritional requirements of billions of people over the next century. © 2021 The Author(s).

For it to be a truly useful approach, however, we argue that social benefits and equity must be explicitly prioritized alongside environmental and economic concerns. This integration of social dimensions within the Blue Economy is required to ensure that marine economic sectors contribute to achieving sustainable development goals. We review what an equity-focused ‘Blue Economy’ might mean for some established and emergent marine sectors and note existing guidelines that may be used for incorporating these aspects into planning. Moving towards a Blue Economy does not only imply developing emerging sectors in undeveloped areas; larger challenges will be found in transforming industries that already have significant economic and livelihood contributions despite concurrent social and environmental concerns. A ‘marine industrial revolution’—as the Blue Economy has sometimes been understood—cannot achieve sustainable development and well-being if it does not avoid the widespread negative social and ecological impacts of historical development pathways. A concerted effort is therefore necessary to design and implement inclusive and equitable policies as an integral part of a Blue Economy that is transformative and not only expansive. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Sharks are key attractions at some of the most important marine ecotourism sites throughout Mexico, focusing particularly on whale sharks, white sharks, hammerhead sharks, and several other reef-associated and pelagic species. This generates important employment opportunities and millions of USD in revenue, but truly implementing ecotourism requires that education and conservation be a part of activities and that these benefit local communities, so that the industry can be socially, economically and ecologically sustainable. In Mexico, this includes addressing potential negative impacts from vessel overcrowding, provisioning, inequitable distribution of ecotourism and conservation benefits and costs, and a broader lack of governance capacity to ensure that coastal development is environmentally sustainable and socially equitable.

Against this backdrop, the chapter provides an examination of coastal tourism in South Africa from a geographical perspective. The study is the first to map out the size, complexion and spatial distribution of coastal tourism in South Africa on the basis of investigating the 15 district and metropolitan municipalities that adjoin the national coastal line. Arguably, the contribution of coastal areas to South Africa’s tourism economy is in relative decline. Existing coastal tourism is geographically concentrated upon the two major coastal metropolitan areas. In addition, different geographies are revealed for different types of tourism, namely leisure as opposed to business or VFR travel and for domestic as opposed to international travel. The research discloses that coastal tourism is polarizing and is increasingly an urban phenomenon in South Africa. The uneven geographical impacts of coastal tourism raise a number of policy concerns about the need for strategic interventions to spread more widely the impacts of coastal tourism in the country. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the evolution of marine governance in Ireland in response to EU policy requirements in relation to the development of a sustainable blue economy in coherence with the United Nations Ocean Decade (2021-2030). In response to these EU requirements, Ireland has introduced the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) and Maritime Area Planning Act, 2021 (MAPA) in 2021 to deliver this sustainable blue economy. This new marine and coastal governance framework in Ireland reforms the consenting regime for key blue economy sectors such as Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) and sets new policy requirements for the integration of aquaculture within the MSP framework. However, the exclusion of aquaculture from the new consenting regime may hinder the full integration of the sector into MSP and impede compliance with environmental goals established by EU Directives (e.g., WFD, MSFD, MSPD). This review identifies policy and legal gaps which may impede the integration of aquaculture into the new Irish marine governance and national MSP process. Furthermore, this paper analyses aquaculture licensing cases to assess the integration of environmental criteria into planning decisions to gather insight into the readiness of the sector’s transition towards a sustainable model. The analysis from this paper indicates that the legal framework underpinning MSP in Ireland may have a limited impact on the integration of aquaculture and hinder the delivery of sustainability across all marine sectors.

	abstract = {Coastal marine environments provide livelihoods as billions of people around the world depend greatly on sustainability efforts in the Blue Economy. In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities. © Copyright © 2020 Hoerterer, Schupp, Benkens, Nickiewicz, Krause and Buck.},

A recent review of the governance of the global ocean identified 191 governance arrangements for issues affecting transboundary marine resources. We suggest that instead of simply bemoaning the status quo as being fragmented, the opportunity exists to put in place a holistic multilevel global framework for governing the world’s ocean, building on the strengths of existing arrangements. The United Nations could play a leadership role in providing the mechanism and resources needed to facilitate this. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Oceans occupy approximately seventy-one percent of the earth’s surface, and vast regions of oceans are virtually unexplored, especially the deep parts where humans have never been. Therefore, it is urgent to understand our oceans from a number of perspectives. In this paper, the concept of Smart Ocean (SO) is constructed from the perspectives of environmental protection, sustainable development of the blue economy and marine disaster prevention and mitigation. First, a double-funnel structure concept model of SO, including ocean observation infrastructure, data, information, application, knowledge and decision support layers, is put forward. Second, the differences between SO and Digital Ocean (DO) are analyzed. Third, taking the Decision Support System for Emergency at Taiwan Strait as an example, a case study, which has assisted in saving more than 200 people, is introduced. Finally, future research agenda is summarized into seven aspects, including new instrumentation and sensor technologies, ocean big data mining and knowledge discovering, prediction, forecast and uncertainty analysis, ocean environment protection technologies and policy, sustainable use of ocean energy and resource, the influence and response to global changes in the ocean, and interdisciplinary collaboration and public service. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Blue economy like green economy tries to bring to forefront the role of economic players, both state and non-state market actors, thus making it important to examine the issue from the lens of international political economy. This article defines blue economy as economic practices that seek to achieve conservation, inclusive development and sustainable use of oceans and seas as commons through poly-centric, multi-level and multi-actor interventions. Blue economy initiatives analysed here include Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform, World Bank PROBLUE and Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Initiative. The analysed initiatives are not yet designed to appreciate the complexity involving ocean-as-commons. Moreover, the stakeholders mobilised remain concentrated in limited developed countries, mostly from Europe. Even mobilisation of market players remains limited to large companies and boutique firms specific to sustainability. This review argues that blue economy narratives and initiatives need to recognise that ocean systems being complex require poly-centric, multi-level, incremental and learning-based approaches. © 2020 National Maritime Foundation.},

Use case study demonstrates the possibility to address the problem of information system deployment in harsh industrial environment to gather valuable statistical knowledge. Custom made monitoring and data transmission units were developed to utilize the best practice of engineering to solve real problems of Klaipeda Port. Several key operations and parameters were monitored during the research, including containers spreader movements, physical characteristics of the cables, metal constructions. Initial results suggested that crane operators' involvement in the control of the cargo movement produced incorrect control patterns (joystick movements) that delayed port operations. Each control movement of the joystick needs to have a direct real-time feedback from the spreader (actual movement of the cargo). Feedback control functionality will allow adjusting the spreader movement according to the operator and will decrease the cargo transportation time during constant breaks. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

	abstract = {A multi-purpose platform is an offshore system designed to serve the purposes of more than one offshore industry. Within the context of “The Blue Growth Farm” project, an innovative multi-purpose configuration, comprising a wind turbine, wave energy converters, and an internal pool to accommodate aquaculture fish cages, has been proposed. The present work proposes a framework to assess the coupled dynamic response of the multi-purpose platform in realistic environmental conditions. A simplified parametric analysis of the structure is first carried out to propose a preliminary design of the platform. The preliminary design is subsequently investigated through hydro-elastic and aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled analyses. Modal analysis is performed through a 3D finite-element structural model. It confirms the feasibility of rigid-body hypothesis for the dynamic analysis of the support structure and manifests that the vibration modes of the structure are not excited by wave or wind loads. In order to assess the coupled dynamic responses, an aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled numerical model is developed. The motion and structural responses in operational and survival states are investigated. A modified mean up-crossing rate method has been employed to assess the ultimate limit state. The results obtained from the present research confirm the technical feasibility of the proposed configuration and provide a reference for further studies on similar concepts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},
