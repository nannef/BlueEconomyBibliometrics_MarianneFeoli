	abstract = {In Agenda 2063, the African Union focused on making the use of ocean resources a priority in the new frontier of its blue economy. However, most African countries are still lagging in taking the initial steps of identifying and prioritising blue economy sectors and understanding the risk to sea and ocean health. Many have not developed integrated blue economy strategies and road maps, and this delays the progress and vision for an African blue economy envisaged by Agenda 2063 and 2050 Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy. For Africa, however, the blue economy offers greater opportunity beyond the economy and the environment. It presents Africa with a unique opportunity to achieve its national objectives, to improve regional integration, and to exert influence in the global setting. In this review, we agree with Schot and Steinmueller (2018) that we need to develop new framings and begin to experiment with new policy practices to address social and environmental challenges. Furthermore, we maintain that existing theories and knowledge based on innovation studies in Africa may be significant for designing and implementing policies towards climate change mitigation, blue economy governance, and sustainability transitions. Finally, we conclude by highlighting how experimentation is the key feature of transformative innovation policy that Africa has to employ in its blue economy while emphasizing how Africa (and the Global South generally) are in a unique position to develop their own transformation models that are different from those of the Global North. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Oceans, seas, and marine resources are highly relevant for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Such relevance has given rise to the blue economy approach, where scholars and policymakers see activities carried out in cargo ports from a different perspective. The blue economy approach stresses the emergence of multiple transnational networks in relation to these topics and the development of green ports plus environmental measurements at seaports in general. In this context, our study aimed to review the various scientifically documented methods for measuring environmental performance in ports, ports companies, or port authorities in the maritime transport and inland waterways framework. The study followed a scientometric meta-analytic methodology to accomplish its goals. The study strictly referred to the Environmental Performance in Ports (EPP) and extracted the corpus to analyze data held in five databases embedded in the Web of Science Core Collection. Then, the selection was processed and refined with the PRISMA guidelines to establish the eligibility criteria for articles with the PICOS (Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study) tool. A limited study set was identified. This included port environmental performance indicators and studies that were strongly influenced by the European Sea Ports Organization and Green Marine networks. These were compared based on the ecological Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), scale structure, and diversity in application. Finally, we assessed two measurement forms documented in the scientific research on the subject at a global level and discussed their pros and cons. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Tourism development has been promoted as an alternative livelihood to reduce the dependence of small island communities on declining marine resources. It is often central to emerging agendas around marine planning and the blue economy. However, relatively little is known about how communities perceive tourism development as an alternative and potentially sustainable livelihood in their area and its implications. This qualitative study tracks a governance system in transition and analyzes the factors perceived by stakeholders to be driving and hindering the adoption of tourism-based livelihoods on small islands in UNESCO’s Taka Bonerate Kepulauan Selayar Biosphere Reserve (Indonesia). The findings indicate that, despite a series of tourism-enhancing investments and initiatives and the positive attitudes of local communities towards it, tourism is not a direct route towards sustainability for small island communities. The benefits of tourism are perceived to be unequally distributed. The lack of education and skills limits participation in new job opportunities, and the incentives to continue destructive fishing inhibits livelihood transition to tourism. The article concludes that tourism cannot be assumed to generate simultaneous benefits for conservation and development without more equitable benefit sharing, the meeting of basic needs in communities, and addressing the drivers of unsustainable livelihoods. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Lakes, rivers and oceans provide unique resources and support fisheries and aquaculture worldwide. The fisheries and aquaculture sector of Kenya contributes approximately 0.8% to the country's GDP. Marine production is about 9 000 tonnes per year. Marine finfish form the bulk of the marine production, while shellfish (e.g. prawns, lobsters and crabs), molluscs (e.g. octopi and squids) are underexploited. The Fishery sector has the potential of about USD 5 billion for the Blue Economy in Kenya. Crab fishery in Kenya is active in some areas of the south and north coast. The crab resources along the Kenyan waters are diverse and a variety of species are edible. The most commonly fished crab by artisanal fishers is the Mangrove Mud Crab Scylla serrata. Semi-commercial and industrial fishers usually have portunid and other deep sea crabs as by-catch in trawl and longline fisheries, which in many cases are unutilized. Exports of live crabs have increased over the years, with exports mainly to Asian countries. Export of frozen crabs started recently. The need to sustainably utilize lake, river and ocean resources is recognized and important in promoting Blue Economy. Sustainable development of crab fishery provides a potential area for the Blue Economy development in Kenya. Research is essential to crab fishery development.

	abstract = {Numerous oil and gas (O&G) installations worldwide will need to be decommissioned in the near future. Complete removal of subsea structures is often the default approach although some regions retain structures under rigs-to-reefs programs. Here, we reviewed the published literature to understand the status of global research on decommissioning, and specifically identify gaps in ecological knowledge. We estimated the frequency of different research categories (i.e., themes, and spatial/temporal scales), and tested the assumption that the number of papers across the categories of each research aspect was even in distribution. However, the frequency of studies focusing on biodiversity at a local (≤100 km2) scale (relative to regional and oceanic and pan-oceanic scales) were significantly higher; while other theme categories (e.g., eco-toxicology, connectivity, structural-integrity, restoration and other) were significantly lower than expected. Temporally, ≤1-year studies were more frequent than multi-year studies, but these frequencies did not significantly deviate from the assumed distribution of equal frequencies. We propose that further research be carried out to evaluate the benefits of both retention and removal of structures. Ecological research on decommissioning should extend its focus beyond biodiversity, to include eco-toxicology, structural-integrity, connectivity at larger spatial and temporal scales. This would provide a more holistic assessment of ecological impacts to inform sustainable and equitable development choices in multiple Blue Economy sectors, as we transition from offshore O&G to marine renewables. © Copyright © 2021 Schläppy, Robinson, Camilieri-Asch and Miller.},

As a regionally important extension to the otherwise narrow East African continental shelf, the North Kenya Banks remain under studied with implications for efforts to develop a sustainable fisheries management strategy. The local marine ecosystem is known to be strongly influenced by wind driven upwelling processes with seasonal variability driven by the changing monsoon seasons being of particular importance. Nevertheless, the Western Indian Ocean is warming due to anthropogenic climate change with evidence indicating reduced ocean productivity in future. How the ecosystem of the North Kenya Banks will respond is currently uncertain but is of great importance due to the significance of coastal fishery resources to coastal communities, and growing Blue Economy initiatives to exploit the North Kenya Banks fisheries more widely. There is, however, limited knowledge of the processes influencing productivity over the North Kenya Banks regions and currently there is no management plan in place to sustainably manage the fishery resources.

	abstract = {A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is described for a novel wave energy converters (WEC) design based on a marine hybrid bio-structure—a combination of macroalgae, shellfish or other species on a built frame. The Bio-Oscillator design utilises a hard “skeleton” (e.g., carbon fibre, wood) on which biological organisms (e.g., shellfish, large macroalgae) are grown. As waves pass by, the load generated by the oscillating drag and inertia is transferred through mooring lines to power takeoff technology. This novel approach essentially reverses the typical marine engineering view that “bio-fouling is bad” and instead leverages off the added-drag of biological growth on structures. The approach results in a structure that is largely biodegradable, naturally self-replicating and synergistic with the background environment, self-de-risking in terms of failure impact and can leverage off its own form to enhance energy capture beyond a conventional design. This reduces impact while connecting with conventional marine industries such as aquaculture. A CBA examines the economic pros and cons of this approach, focusing on installation and material costs, along with benefits from synergistic production. The analysis suggests that in addition to typical wave energy obstacles (e.g., cable length, capture width, and power take off) the benefits (biodegradability, harvestability, and carbon reduction) of replacing much of the mass of the structure with living biological material can be included. © Copyright © 2021 Hildebrand, Fischer, Relano, Gorman and Stevens.},

	abstract = {The economic potential of Kenya marine resources is critical for the socioeconomic development. The current study reports fisheries output from marine systems in Kenya as a priority for Blue Economy investment in order to rival the current production from inland systems as a trigger for sustainable development. The assessment of fish landings and economic value was based on Catch Assessment Surveys, cruises and secondary literature. Kenya's inland capture fisheries contributes about 83%, aquaculture 12%, and marine artisanal fisheries 5%. Lake Victoria that contributes up to 90% of inland capture fish production has shown decline in catches in the recent past and the trend indicates that the fishery may not be sustainable. The Kenya Exclusive Economic Zone has a coast line of about 647 km and an area of 142,000 kmthat constitutes about 42% of the country's surface area and has several commercially important species that are barely exploited; yet it produces a paltry 26,000 mt annually that is estimated at an export value of about USD 50 million. However, recent estimates have found that Kenya Exclusive Economic Zone could contain up to 2 million mt of fish that is valued at about USD 130 million. Furthermore, additional worth along the value chain and with substantial trickle-down effect that could have a positive impact on the Blue Growth in Kenya and other developing nations with oceanic potential - triggering the possibility for sustainable exploitation.

	abstract = {Blue Economy represents a new and interesting concept on a global level, both from the economic potential but also by the fact that it can be used to reduce environmental degradation. The main goal of this research is to identify the causality relations between the greenhouse gas emissions, the Blue Economy and economic growth based on a panel of annual data from the 28 countries that are members of the European Union (EU) over the 2009–2018 period. After applying stationarity and cointegration tests, the long term cointegration coefficients shall be determined with the help of the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) estimator. Granger causality estimation based on the vector error correction model (VECM) was applied to identify the causality relationship between the variables and to detect the direction of causality. Based on the identified causality relations, the Blue Economy has a significant influence on greenhouse gas emissions in the long run. Unidirectional causality relations were identified from the economic growth of greenhouse gas emissions in the long term, as well as from the greenhouse gas emissions on economic growth in the short term. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Since the beginning of the decade of the oceans (2021–2030), many countries failed to even develop minimal fisheries management. In some countries, where legislation is appropriately applied to the logistics of marine fishing operations, some measures of containment and fisheries management are being implemented. However, other countries have no effective plans for the sustainable development of the sector. In this paper, we have compiled information on the historical discrepancies in fisheries management in the extensive Brazilian waters and used it to illustrate the institutional neglect of this important blue-economy sector. Since the 1930s, when the first management agencies were registered, fisheries management has been handled by at least 10 different federal agencies. This discontinuity has resulted in a country that is ignorant, overall, of the quantity fished, where fishing occurs, and the status of its fish stocks. The only available long-term fishing production data is held by small state departments or marine protected areas and does not come close to reflecting the total catch of the country, with its continental dimensions and its mix of artisanal and industrial fisheries. For this reason, the present work has compiled information on the years of neglect in the governance of the fishing sector. In addition, we suggest the creation of a pivotal management model, based on three main pillars, for sustainable fisheries development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Marine litter is a complex paradigm requiring innovative solutions. Public administrations are willing to contribute to counterpart marine litter but insufficient knowledge hindrance the progress. The integration of economic assessment in the decision-making may help to design knowledge-based solutions that guarantee a good marine litter management within the Blue Economy framework. Nonetheless, there is no clear methodology to do such assessments in the literature. In this study a new approach was implemented by assessing the effectiveness and the efficiency of four solutions designed to remove, monitor and/or manage floating marine litter (FML). In addition, the willingness to pay by local public administrations for purchasing such solutions was assessed. The solutions were tested in the inner waters of the Basque coast (South-Eastern Bay of Biscay), these being: the collection of FML by (1) a litter interception riverine barrier; (2) retrofitted fishing vessels engaged in the active Fishing for Litter; (3) sea-cleaning vessels operated with and without (4) a smart decision-support tool (LEMA Tool). The efficiency was measured by the cost of removing 1 kg of FML and comparing it to other alternative technologies; the effectiveness by a comparison of costs and benefits of removing marine litter for the local fisheries, aquaculture, ports and shipping and tourism sectors; and the willingness to pay was evaluated by Contingent Valuation Method. Results show that the density of FML affects the outcome of the efficiency, effectiveness, and willingness to pay and in return, the density depends on the operating ground and the season of the year among other factors. The most efficient solution is the cleaning vessels (4–7 EUR/kg of FML), followed by the Fishing for Litter fishing vessels (4–75 EUR/kg). LEMA Tool may improve the efficiency of both, fishing vessels and cleaning vessel, but the relative improvement depends on the knowledge of the fishers, the accuracy of the sea surface circulation models and again the local litter density. The barrier proved to be the least efficient solution (103 EUR/kg) and its efficiency depends on the river characteristics. Cleaning vessels are an effective solution, fishing vessel may be effective depending on the operating area among other variables. The willingness to pay of the public administration for purchasing technologies that enable the removal of FML is estimated as 1–8 EUR/kg. These outputs can provide good guidance for decision-makers to overcome the existing problem while prevention measures are implemented and take effect in the environment. Results highlight the possibility of having vessels engaged in the active and the passive Fishing for Litter, when the scopes of each activity are well defined, and overlapping is inexistent. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Interest in the mining of polymetallic nodules, sulfide deposits, and ferromanganese crusts in the deep sea is growing. While the impacts of deep-sea mining on benthic systems are somewhat understood, there is little information available on pelagic impacts via, for example, the discharge plume. The impacts of these suspended sediments on pelagic communities can have consequences for the fishing industry if their target species are directly or indirectly impacted. Here, we quantify how tuna fisheries on the high seas spatially intersect with mining areas for which exploration contracts have been issued. We explore the spatial intersection of potential mining impacts by investigating different areal extensions around the mining areas as proxies for the spread of potential sediment plumes and movements of tunas. We investigate which countries are fishing in these areas and what percentage of their catches from Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) areas may intersect with mining activities. We show that for countries that catch the most in mining areas, their catches from mining areas constitute small to moderate parts of their RFMO catches. There are some exceptions amongst these nations and other, often small island nations and/or developing countries, which can derive a high percentage of their RFMO catch from within mining areas, especially if mining plumes spread to a larger extent. RFMOs and other fishery stakeholders should be aware of these potential spatial intersections with their industry and seek to contribute to the development of mining regulations and policies as another stakeholder in the blue economy. © 2021},

	abstract = {For millennia, coastal and marine ecosystems have adapted and flourished in the Red Sea’s unique environment. Surrounded by deserts on all sides, the Red Sea is subjected to high dust inputs and receives very little freshwater input, and so harbors a high salinity. Coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangroves flourish in this environment and provide socio-economic and environmental benefits to the bordering coastlines and countries. Interestingly, while coral reef ecosystems are currently experiencing rapid decline on a global scale, those in the Red Sea appear to be in relatively better shape. That said, they are certainly not immune to the stressors that cause degradation, such as increasing ocean temperature, acidification and pollution. In many regions, ecosystems are already severely deteriorating and are further threatened by increasing population pressure and large coastal development projects. Degradation of these marine habitats will lead to environmental costs, as well as significant economic losses. Therefore, it will result in a missed opportunity for the bordering countries to develop a sustainable blue economy and integrate innovative nature-based solutions. Recognizing that securing the Red Sea ecosystems’ future must occur in synergy with continued social and economic growth, we developed an action plan for the conservation, restoration, and growth of marine environments of the Red Sea. We then investigated the level of resources for financial and economic investment that may incentivize these activities. This study presents a set of commercially viable financial investment strategies, ecological innovations, and sustainable development opportunities, which can, if implemented strategically, help ensure long-term economic benefits while promoting environmental conservation. We make a case for investing in blue natural capital and propose a strategic development model that relies on maintaining the health of natural ecosystems to safeguard the Red Sea’s sustainable development. © Copyright © 2021 Cziesielski, Duarte, Aalismail, Al-Hafedh, Anton, Baalkhuyur, Baker, Balke, Baums, Berumen, Chalastani, Cornwell, Daffonchio, Diele, Farooq, Gattuso, He, Lovelock, Mcleod, Macreadie, Marba, Martin, Muniz-Barreto, Kadinijappali, Prihartato, Rabaoui, Saderne, Schmidt-Roach, Suggett, Sweet, Statton, Teicher, Trevathan-Tackett, Joydas, Yahya and Aranda.},

	abstract = {The "Blue Economy" is used to describe all of the economic activities related to the sea, with a special emphasis on sustainability. Traditional activities such as fisheries, but also undersea mining, tourism, and scientific research are included, as well as the phenomenal growth of aquaculture during the past decade. All of these activities, and the irresistible prospect of another new frontier, has led to enthusiastic and, most likely, overenthusiastic assessments of the possibilities to exploit the sea to feed the world, provide low-cost energy, become a new source of minerals, and other future miracles. This book makes sense of these trends and of the future of the blue economy by following our remote ancestors who gradually discovered the sea and its resources, describing the so-called fisherman's curse - or why fishermen have always been poor, explaining why humans tend to destroy the resources on which we depend, and assessing the realistic expectations for extracting resources from the sea. Although the sea is not so badly overexploited as the land, our demands on ecosystem services are already above the oceans' sustainability limits. Some new ideas, including "fishing down" for untapped resources such as plankton, could lead to the collapse of the entire marine ecosystem. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020, 2021.

	abstract = {Following the global shutdown of tourism at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, small island developing states such as The Bahamas had their economies immobilized due to their heavy dependence on the industry. Beyond economic recovery in a post COVID-19 paradigm, the blue economy, blue growth, and associated activities offer pathways for a more resilient economy and is well-suited for The Bahamas. This paper suggests conduits for economic development using a traditional strength, coastal and marine tourism, in conjunction with the emerging fields of ocean renewable energy, offshore aquaculture, marine biotechnology, and bioprospecting. The interlinkages between each activity are discussed. Knowledge gaps in offshore aquaculture, ocean renewable energy, marine biotechnology, and marine environment monitoring are identified. In each sector case, strategic and tactical decision-making can be achieved through the exploitation of ocean numerical modeling and observations, and consequently should be invested in and developed alongside the requisite computational resources. Blue growth is encouraged, but instances of blue injustice are also highlighted. Crucially, pursuing blue economy activities should be given top national priority for economic recovery and prosperity. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The oceans are increasingly viewed as a new frontier for economic development. Yet, as companies and governments race to capitalize on marine resources, substantial risks can arise for people and the environment. The dominant discourse that frames blue growth as beneficial for the economy, developing nations, and coastal communities risks downplaying the uneven distribution of benefits and potential harms. Civil society organizations and academics alike have been sounding the alarm about the social justice implications of rapid and unchecked ocean development. Here, we review existing literature to highlight ten social injustices that might be produced by blue growth: 1) dispossession, displacement and ocean grabbing; 2) environmental justice concerns from pollution and waste; 3) environmental degradation and reduction of ecosystem services; 4) livelihood impacts for small-scale fishers; 5) lost access to marine resources needed for food security and well-being; 6) inequitable distribution of economic benefits; 7) social and cultural impacts; 8) marginalization of women; 9) human and Indigenous rights abuses; and, 10) exclusion from governance. Through this critical review, we aim to stimulate a rigorous dialogue on future pathways to achieve a more just and inclusive ocean economy. We contend that a commitment to ‘blue justice’ must be central to the blue growth agenda, which requires greater attention to addressing the 10 risks that we have highlighted, and propose practical actions to incorporate recognitional, procedural, and distributional justice into the future ocean economy. However, achieving a truly just ocean economy may require a complete transformation of the blue growth paradigm. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Seaweeds are primary producers and among the important marine ecosystem engineers capable of modifying their surrounding abiotic and biotic environments. The southern coast of Bangladesh has an excellent prospect for seaweeds farming due to favorable environmental conditions and natural availability of commercially important species. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the present study determines potential contribution of seaweeds toward achieving several targets of United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the blue economic development in Bangladesh. There are 300 households engaged in seaweeds farming, primarily along the southeast coast, producing 390 tonnes wet weight (= 97.5 tonnes dry weight) of seaweeds per annum with potential applications in food, feed, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals sectors. And the current seaweeds production can be increased yearly at ~50% rate, which is 50 million tonnes (dry weight) from ~5,000 km2 farming area when extrapolated to the year 2050. This may bring a positive change to issues regarding food security, gender equality, economic growth, nutrients removal, carbon sequestration, employment and aquatic environmental health. Overall, the benefits of seaweeds farming could reflect on 26 targets of 8 SDGs and potentially contribute US$0.7 million to the blue economy in Bangladesh. © 2021},

	abstract = {Development of a blue economy is firmly embedded in the development plans of Bangladesh. Advances in freshwater aquaculture have promoted Bangladesh to the fifth largest fish producer in the world. However, the marine resource base of Bangladesh, which is now even greater following the recent settling of disputes regarding maritime boundaries with neighbouring countries, lends itself to the development of marine aquaculture—known as mariculture. Several potential areas and opportunities for mariculture development have been identified for implementation under the concept of blue economy development in Bangladesh. We identify the most promising fish species as the hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha), seabass (Lates calcarifer) and the grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), and the shrimp species as black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), brown shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros), Indian white shrimp (Penaeus indicus) and the mud crab (Scylla serata). Further, some non-traditional marine species like seaweed, microalgae, shellfish (mussel, oyster) and the sea cucumber offer considerable potential. However, there remain major challenges and constraints that need to be addressed in order for mariculture to further develop and contribute to a growing blue economy in Bangladesh. Most notably, ministries, departments and research institutions, along with interested private entrepreneurs, must collaborate to formulate strategies for effective development and implementation, so that mariculture can contribute to food security and economic development through export opportunities. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Efforts to expand the marine aquaculture industry often draw on a discourse of opportunity that highlights untapped potential for economic growth. This discourse also underlies the more general concept of Blue Economy in which oceans are a frontier for economic development. Marine aquaculture is seen as an important part of Blue Economy, but the current discourse overlooks evidence that straightforward trickle-down effects—from aggregate economic growth at the national level to holistic benefits at the community level—rarely exist for marine aquaculture. Using the case of marine aquaculture in the United States, we argue that a shift in focus to community wellbeing is necessary to realize the potential benefits of marine aquaculture expansion. More generally, we suggest that marine aquaculture illustrates the need to reorient Blue Economy to Blue Communities, a concept that draws on the multidimensional concept of wellbeing to foreground social, cultural, and environmental factors alongside economic growth. With attention to just and equitable governance embedded in place and context, marine aquaculture can grow in ways that enhance wellbeing in Blue Communities while supporting broader economic development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The complex nature of the Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) requires the integration and consideration of multiple elements, ranging from the ecological and environmental to the socio-economic as well as the political, institutional or cultural. To succeed, the public policies demand techniques and tools that allow to evaluate the effects or impacts on the society. By applying an empirical approach, this paper presents a framework to evaluate the direct economic impacts linked to the implementation of MSP policies in three case studies: Belgium, Germany and Norway. The methodological procedure is sequenced in 4 phases: identification of the sectors involved, data collection, construction of counterfactual scenarios and estimate of impacts after consulting the stakeholders. With the application of this framework to the case studies, an estimate was made of the variations in the value of production for each marine sector that can be directly attributed to the implementation of the MSP. In general, they were positive in the three cases analysed. In the medium scenario, cumulative final direct impacts of € 1875 million were estimated in the German case (2010–2016 period), € 929 million in the Belgian case (2014–2016) and € 2262 million in the Norwegian case (2013–2016). These results can serve as the basis for further estimations of indirect and induced impacts of the implementation of spatial management policies in a blue economy context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A number of commentators have argued that up until now marine/maritime spatial planning (MSP) research and practice have been dominated by blue economy and environmental concerns and have tended to neglect what might be regarded as social sustainability concerns. To gain more insight into the character and extent of such a gap, as well as how to address it, this article examines how social sustainability has been addressed in peer reviewed scientific articles on MSP between 2005 and 2020. Using search terms such as participation, democracy, social inclusion, social cohesion, equity we systematically identify and review 310 scientific articles that address diverse social sustainability concerns within MSP and marine governance. The review showed that very few papers systematically conceptualised or developed a coherent framework for engaging with social sustainability. Instead, they mostly addressed particular social concerns including participation and engagement, equity and social justice, socio-cultural values and preferences. Marine management and planning efficiency, as well as related instrumental framings of the merits of participation were the key arguments for including these dimensions of social sustainability in MSP. In terms of how to better include social sustainability in MSP, most attention was given to social-cultural mapping and ways to improve social inclusion/participation while also redressing exclusion and maldistribution of outcomes in MSP practice. We conclude that there is a need to deepen and diversify MSP inquiry with respect to social sustainability. In particular, scholars would do well to delve deeper and more broadly in social science literature to find inspiration on ways to understand and elucidate social issues. Here, the enormous body of relevant work on justice, power, critical institutionalism, political ecology and terrestrial planning literatures has hardly been tapped. It is also evident from this review that there is a need for both the academic and practice-based communities to more comprehensively address how the multidimensions of social sustainability interact with each other, as well as with economic and environmental aspects of marine planning and governance. Based on these observations, we highlight a set of suggestions on how to develop MSP research and practice on social sustainability. Most importantly, we argue that more in-depth co-production, linking scholars, practitioners and society actors, is needed. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {It is generally agreed that the blue economy and blue growth play important roles in the global economy; over the last few years, they have been widely discussed at both national and international levels. Nevertheless, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure them, as the accounting methodologies differ between studies, implying divergent results. This article summarizes previous studies by comparing blue economy accounting methodologies and highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Based on the comparison, a new methodology is proposed, based primarily on micro- and country-specific local data; this new methodology has been applied to measure the size of the blue economy in Poland. The results show that previous analyses have slightly underestimated the size of the blue economy in Poland, despite similarities concerning general dynamics and sectoral structure over time. The study concludes that a trade-off exists between using existing one-size-fits-all methods and country-specific methods, with a more precise, tailored approach being achieved at the expense of the accuracy of cross-country comparisons. Finally, the study highlights that, as there is no unambiguous solution to the problem of the above trade-off, different methods should be used with regard to the choice of method depends on the specific research task to be carried out or policy question to be addressed.

New researches point out that the Blue Economy impact will double in next ten years. Although present in theory since 1990ties, blue economy in last few years as a part of the answer on the global challenges, has been followed by the aspects of Green Development, Green Economy Green Growth as synonyms for desirable and necessary transition towards sustainability. The definition of Green Economy in perspective of long-term sustainability, environment protection and reduced use of natural resources is defined as well.

	abstract = {The textile industry has been concerned with the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, according to a set of principles designated as the Blue Economy. Likewise, the textile industry has been identifying cleaner production practices with the purpose of reducing water consumption and limiting the use of toxics namely for fabric dyeing, in order to limit the disposal of toxic effluents and prevent the contamination of rivers, and oceans. This study has the objective of evaluating the Eco efficiency of a textile industry that implemented Cleaner Production practices for water reuse, and the minimization of the usage of water and materials aligned with the Blue Economy principles. The study used a case study approach, involving data collection through observation, documental analysis and interviews. The study contributes for theory by relating Cleaner Production and Blue Economy, topics that are not often explored together. It also contributes to the managerial practice offering a real case of Cleaner Production and Blue Economy strategy, leading to the minimization of environmental impacts of 516.2 thousand tons per year in several domains, including the biotic, abiotic, water and air. 96.9% of the gains were observed in the use of water resources, including economic gains from water reuse, and from the commercialization of sludge as a by-product. Despite the investment of 771.5 thousand dollars in cleaner technologies a return on investments was achieved after 29 months. The study also favoured the elimination of pollutants in the effluents that are disposed in rivers, lakes and the sea, contributing to the improvement in the health conditions of local communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ocean-based economic development arising from an increasing interest in the 'blue economy' is placing ecosystems and small-scale fisheries under pressure. The dominant policy response for dealing with multiple uses is the allocation of coastal space through coastal zone planning (CZP). Recent studies have shown that the rush to develop the blue economy and regulate coastal activity can result in social injustices and the exclusion of less powerful and unrecognized groups (e.g., small-scale fishers, women, Indigenous peoples and youth). To achieve a primary goal of the 2030 sustainable development agenda to "leave no one behind", it is important to understand the implications of coastal planning and development for these groups. Here, we present a social survey protocol for examining perceptions of justice related to small-scale fisheries (SSF) in the context of the blue economy in coastal areas. Specifically, we designed the survey instrument and sampling protocol to assess whether decisions about the use of the coastal zone over the last five years have i) followed principles of good governance, ii) recognized fishers' knowledge, culture and rights and iii) been attentive to impacts of changed coastal zone use on fisheries. The survey will engage coastal planners (N = app. 120) and fishers (N = app. 4300) in all the coastal municipalities (N = 81) in Northern-Norway. The sampling protocol is designed to ensure representation of different sectors of society, including those defined by gender, age, ethnicity and occupation (e.g., small-scale fishers, large-scale fishers, coastal planners). © 2021 Engen et al.

	abstract = {This paper examines the concept of maritime multi-use as a territorial/SPATIAL governance instrument for the enhancement of sustainable development in five EU sea basins. Multi-use (MU) is expected to enhance the productivity of blue economy sectors, as well as deliver additional socio-economic benefits related to the environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development. The paper provides a definition of maritime multi-use and identifies the multi-uses with the highest potential in EU sea basins. In each sea basin, multi-use plays a different role as concerns sustainable development. For the Eastern Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, the MU focus should remain on the environmental pillar of sustainable development. In the North Sea, North Atlantic and Western Baltic Sea, addressing social sustainability seems a key precondition for success of MU in enhancement of sustainable spatial development at sea. Moreover, it has been suggested to introduce MU key global strategies such as SDGs or Macroregional strategies and action plans and to supplement maritime spatial planning with sectoral incentives and educational efforts as key vehicles supporting MU. The paper concludes by identifying aspects which, in order to inform maritime spatial planning and maritime governance regarding a more conscious application of the aforementioned concept, require further investigation. Key tasks are related to: More profound evaluation of performance of policies supporting MUs, researching the impact of MU on societal goals and on the MU costs and benefits, including external ones, and finally identifying the impact of MU on the development of various sectors and regions on land. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {Economic activities in the ocean (that is, the ‘blue economy’) provide value to society, yet also jeopardize marine ecosystems. For example, fisheries are an essential source of income and food security for billions of people, yet bycatch poses a major threat to marine biodiversity, creating trade-offs between economic growth and biodiversity conservation. This Perspective explores bycatch levies as a market-based instrument for reconciling these trade-offs. We outline the theory and practice of bycatch levies to demonstrate how they could incentivize bycatch prevention and raise revenue for compensatory conservation, provided they are well designed, as part of a policy mix for sustainable and equitable ocean governance. We then explore ways forward for mainstreaming bycatch levies into the blue economy. While compensatory bycatch mitigation has been controversial, increasing adoption of net outcome approaches to biodiversity conservation suggests they could become mainstreamed within the next decade. Bycatch levies could raise billions of dollars towards closing global biodiversity financing gaps, delivering net outcomes for biodiversity under the United Nations Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework while enabling blue growth, and moving towards win–wins for economic welfare and biodiversity conservation. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {For over two decades, the countries, subregional and regional level intergovernmental organizations in the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR) have been engaged in an initiative to implement a regional governance approach for managing the shared living marine resources of the Caribbean Sea and adjacent regions. Given the inherent socio-economic and geopolitical complexity of the region, this approach has been recognized as essential to address the challenges associated with the interconnected nature of shared ecosystem goods and services upon which countries in the region depend. This paper uses a retrospective lens to shed light on the challenges confronting the region and its efforts to overcome them. It is based on the Large Marine Ecosystem Governance Framework developed specifically for the WCR in 2006 and characterized as “learning by doing.” Data were obtained for this study through desktop review of published literature documenting progress over the period 2001–2021 and insights requested from 15 key individual and institutional contributors involved in the initiative. While the lack of financial resources was an underpinning and cross-cutting issue, key constraints identified were categorized as institutional, capacity building, awareness raising, leadership, legal, political, social capital, or socio-cultural. They include national capacity to engage with regional level processes due to a variety of factors including funding, political, and institutional challenges of developing a regional coordination mechanism, engaging the broader ocean community to create the critical mass needed, the difficulty of mainstreaming ocean affairs into high level political and decision-making fora and the scarcity of local, national and regional technical and political champions. This paper advances understanding of the barriers to be overcome in highly complex socio-politically developing regions if regional ocean governance initiatives are to play the essential role identified in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, reaping the sustainable benefits of a blue economy. © Copyright © 2021 Fanning, Mahon, Compton, Corbin, Debels, Haughton, Heileman, Leotaud, McConney, Moreno, Phillips and Toro.},

Although world leaders have agreed to control greenhouse gases’ (GHGs) emission, the current rate of emission may not stop global climate change (GCC). Scientists have been working to scientifically explain the effects of GHG emission on GCC, however, all climate changing phenomena may not be fully understandable now and more research is necessary to comprehend those knowledge gaps. Climate change has been severely affecting the ecological and socio-economic development but these effects can be mitigated by supporting sustainable technological and economic development as AMs and MPs. MPs to climate change may trade off the negative impacts of GCC and exploring and employing lucrative opportunities in blue economy can help in developing those AMs and MPs. Moreover, it is not possible to rapidly divert all global manufacturing processes into benign technological and economic perfection. For this reason, Bangladesh and other coastal countries are very aware of the need to introduce cost-effective AMs and MPs and society and environment oriented blue economy. Some worthwhile adaptation and mitigation strategies are discussed to minimize the carbon footprint, as remedies to curtail GCC impacts. Scientific relations of GCC with GHG emission and opportunities of blue economy are also explored. © 2021 The Author.},

ASEAN member countries has declared to commit on taking the lead on the regional cooperation in relation to the Blue Economy through ASEAN Leaders' Declaration on the Blue Economy, last 26 October 2021, in Brunei Darussalam. Besides the economic opportunities, Blue Economy has responsibilities to carry out due to the need to ensure ocean sustainability and rules-based ocean governance. We applied descriptive-quantitative methods on building the dataset and some preliminary analysis. As a result, we succeeded identifying ASEAN member countries capacities and capabilities regarding the Blue Economy implementations. We managed to develop ASEAN Blue Economy Dataset using numbers of official and reputable macro-economic and political-security data which are related to established and emerging sectors of Blue Economy. By using the data and indices generated from the dataset, we measured ASEAN 'Blue Economic Posture' to quantify and portray ASEAN's trajectory to actualize sustainable ocean economy in term of capacity building and potential cooperation initiatives. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Ocean noise from humanmade sources of sound (e.g., shipping) can have a detrimental effect on marine animals that use sound to sense their environment. Thus noise can negatively impact the health of marine ecosystems, which are the basis for many sectors of the global “Blue” economy, including commercial fisheries and aquaculture. This project will gather unique baseline data to monitor the “acoustic health” of the oceans. A novel, deep-ocean capable hydrophone-lander system will be deployed at each of these five deep-sea sites (all >7 km deep). The project will involve the collaboration of several U.S. governmental agencies, private industry and NGOs, and international partners to access these global locations. We will collaborate with scientists from each of these five sites to deploy, recover, and analyze this deep ocean acoustic data.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to drive the discourse towards the increasing shift to renewables, especially offshore wind energy generation, in the emerging international energy order. The Indian Ocean Region (IOR), despite its increasing contribution to onshore wind energy generation and impending policies on offshore wind energy, is reluctant to invest in the latter. Hence, this paper highlights four important aspects that challenge IOR’s offshore wind energy development: Indian Ocean’s strategic location, environment impacts, blue economy and maritime terrorism. In the background of the geopolitical rivalry existing in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), with the increasing presence of China and the USA in the Indian Ocean, this paper aims to study if these geopolitical challenges are hindering offshore wind energy generation in IOR. The key findings of the paper include the necessity of addressing the geopolitical rivalry in IOR as an important hindrance in huge investments needed in OWE farms, so that a regional cooperative mechanism is arrived at especially from the point of view of policies towards OWE generation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

Currently, aquaculture contributes approximately 50% of world total fishery production, hence becoming an important intervention in promoting food and nutritional security, and employment creation. Western Kenya is suitable for aquaculture production due to favorable climate and good soil as well as high demand for fish. The present survey purposed to assess the Socio-demographic characteristics of fish farmers, fish feed and seed producers in 9 Counties within Western Kenya The information obtained included socio economic dynamics and challenges to fish farming. Fish farming mainly occur in rural areas in Western Kenya where the most dominant system is earthen ponds, measuring 300 m2. Aquaculture in the region is male dominated and majority of players practice individual enterprises. The majority of the hatcheries are authenticated and the lack of credit facility was mentioned as the most important challenge. However, for feed producers lack of adequate raw materials was the most important bottle neck. From this study, both environmental and social factors in the region must be synergized to achieve aquaculture sustainability. There is need for empowerment of farmers through capacity building and availability of credit facilities whereas hatcheries and feed producers must be empowered with adequate skills and infrastructure in order to adhere to good standards.

With sustainable management of existing assets including shipping, transportation, manufacturing, fisheries, tourism and exploration of new business like marine biotechnology and renewable energy, the ocean or blue economy has potential to fulfill sustainable development goals (SDG). In spite of recognition of blue economy as a new economic frontier, investments by existing industries and emergence of new ones are limited and less known, hence require more in depth attention and scientific understanding. In the present study, authors present a systematic comparative assessment of blue economy sectors with distinct challenges and strategies to be further explored and implemented for industrial deployment.

	abstract = {Ocean activities are rapidly expanding as Blue Economy discussions gain traction, creating new potential synergies and conflicts between sectors. To better manage ocean sectors and their development, we need to understand how they interact and the respective outcomes of these interactions. To provide a first comprehensive picture of the situation, we review 3187 articles to map and analyze interactions between economically important ocean sectors and find 93 unique direct and 61 indirect interactions, often mediated via the ocean ecosystem. Analysis of interaction outcomes reveals that some sectors coexist synergistically (e.g. renewable energy, tourism), but many interactions are antagonistic, and negative effects on other sectors are often incurred via degradation of marine ecosystems. The analysis also shows that ocean ecosystems are fundamental for supporting many ocean sectors, yet 13 out of 14 ocean sectors have interactions resulting in unidirectional negative ecosystem impact. Fishing, drilling, and shipping are hubs in the network of ocean sector interactions, and are involved in many of the antagonistic interactions. Antagonistic interactions signal trade-offs between sectors. Qualitative analysis of the literature shows that these tradeoffs relate to the cumulative nature of many ecosystem impacts incurred by some sectors, and the differential power of ocean sectors to exert their rights or demands in the development of the ocean domain. There are also often time lags in how impacts manifest. The ocean governance landscape is not currently well-equipped to deal with the full range of trade-offs, and opportunities, likely to arise in the pursuit of a Blue Economy in a rapidly changing ocean context. Based on our analysis, we therefore propose a set principles that can begin to guide strategic decision-making, by identifying both tradeoffs and opportunities for sustainable and equitable development of ocean sectors. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The future of the global ocean economy is currently envisioned as advancing towards a ‘blue economy’—socially equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically viable ocean industries1,2. However, tensions exist within sustainable development approaches, arising from differing perspectives framed around natural capital or social equity. Here we show that there are stark differences in outlook on the capacity for establishing a blue economy, and on its potential outcomes, when social conditions and governance capacity—not just resource availability—are considered, and we highlight limits to establishing multiple overlapping industries. This is reflected by an analysis using a fuzzy logic model to integrate indicators from multiple disciplines and to evaluate their current capacity to contribute to establishing equitable, sustainable and viable ocean sectors consistent with a blue economy approach. We find that the key differences in the capacity of regions to achieve a blue economy are not due to available natural resources, but include factors such as national stability, corruption and infrastructure, which can be improved through targeted investments and cross-scale cooperation. Knowledge gaps can be addressed by integrating historical natural and social science information on the drivers and outcomes of resource use and management, thus identifying equitable pathways to establishing or transforming ocean sectors1,3,4. Our results suggest that policymakers must engage researchers and stakeholders to promote evidence-based, collaborative planning that ensures that sectors are chosen carefully, that local benefits are prioritized, and that the blue economy delivers on its social, environmental and economic goals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The main research objective of this study is to examine how coastal urban communities in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF) organize the sustainable development (and emerging blue economy) strategy planning process. Along with this general objective, this study focuses on four more specific questions: First, to examine whether the sustainable development and blue economy concepts are integrated into the urban development strategies and whether they are a real priority for the northern coastal communities? Second, to figure out which local government and civil society institutions are involved in the policy planning process and whether this sphere of local politics is transparent and open to public discussions? Third, to find out which specific aspects of the sustainable development and coastal blue economy concepts are given priority in the municipal development strategies? Finally, to discuss whether the AZRF coastal sustainable development/blue economy strategies aim to solve short‐term/most pressing problems or they suggest longterm policies built on sustainability principles and are oriented to solve fundamental socioeconomic and ecological problems of the AZRF coastal communities? The hypothesis of this study is that a properly designed strategy planning system would be helpful for both familiarizing northern municipalities with the blue economy concept and its effective implementation. This research is based on several empirical cases, including major Arctic coastal urban centers/ports—Anadyr, Arkhangelsk, Dudinka, Murmansk, Naryan‐Mar, Pevek, Sabetta, and Severodvinsk. © 2021 by the authors.

Our vision is a planetary scale array monitoring ocean heat and circulation and sea-level rise and revolutionizing real-time warning systems for earthquake and tsunami disaster mitigation. This is enabled by the trans-ocean cable infrastructure linking society together: 1.4 million km of cable, 20,000 repeaters every 70 km hosting the sensors, constantly being refreshed over 10–25 years, without interfering with telecom. Initial sensors are ocean bottom temperature, pressure and seismic acceleration. System suppliers are on board, the first major SMART project is funded and underway in Portugal (2020), and seven others are in various stages of planning and funding—a perfect example of the Blue Economy in action for the UN Decade. JTF will provide coordination between ocean science, operational oceanography, hazard early warning centers, industry, and relevant government agencies. SMART cables will create profound opportunities for innovation—requiring people with appropriate depth and breadth of expertise.

It establishes important baselines that can serve as points of comparison as, and after, surf tourism returns, inevitably changed, post-COVID-19. Employing a direct cost method, international surf tourism expenditure was valued between $31.5 to $64.9 billion USD per year and surfers reported being willing to pay between $1.99 and $4.1 billion USD more annually for sustainable surf tourism products.

	abstract = {Cruise activities, until 2020, have presented a significant increase in revenue, as well as number of cruises and passengers transported, and it has become a challenge for ports to respond to this demand for services. In response to this, the world’s ports have implemented different governance models. In this context, in this paper, we aim to review the different governance models, as well as port cooperation, competition, and stakeholders. For this purpose, using science metric meta-analysis, an article set is extracted that strictly refers to the governance model of two databases integrated into the Core Collection Web of Science, whose selection process is polished with the PRISMA guidelines, establishing the eligibility criteria of studies using PICOS tool, to which a qualitative meta-analysis is applied. A limited studies set is identified, that includes governance model implementations, private strategies and internalization patterns in the port sector and cruise ships, patterns of port cooperation and governance, governance models in cruise ports, structures and strategies, and changes in the cruise market. Finally, various governance model forms are determined, all documented in the scientific research worldwide, discussing the various components of study topics. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The blue economy, comprising coastal and marine resources, offers vast benefits for sub-Saharan Africa: of the 53 countries and territories in the region, 32 are coastal states; there are 13 million sq km of maritime zones; more than 90% of the region's exports and imports come by sea; and the African Union hails the blue economy as the 'new frontier of African renaissance'. Despite their importance, the region's coastal and marine resources have been neither fully appreciated nor fully utilized. They are only now being recognized as being key to Africa's potential prosperity. As the region grows, it has, in general, not taken adequate safeguards to protect these valuable resources. That is partly because some of the problems (pollution, for example) are regional and know no borders. All too often, short-term gains are made at the expense of the long term (overfishing, for example). This book provides, for the first time, a study of the constraints and opportunities the blue economy offers for sub-Saharan Africa. It includes an introduction and overview; sectoral analyses (including tourism, fisheries, mineral resources, culture, shipping and maritime safety); country case studies; and analyses of regional and international efforts towards better coastal zone and marine management. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Donald L.

The state, as the dominant structure in the world, enables the realization of sustainable maritime transport aims through its instruments. Therefore, it is very significant to consider the national maritime policies because the effective implementation of the global policy is impossible without considering the adequate mechanisms at the state level. The adopted Montenegrin strategic documents impact the institutional framework set-up of the Blue Economy (BE) sectors and potentials for eco-logically sustainable maritime transport. Although there are no practical directions for the sustainable use of sea resources, Montenegro is affirmatively oriented to the BE concept. Knowing that Montenegro is in the process of the pre-accessing EU phase, it is of importance to be on the right road to creating a national maritime transport policy including environmental practices, to become part of the strategic implementation of the BE. The paper provides recommendations that can serve for the successful follow-up of the BE activities in Montenegro and the wider area. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Sustainable use of the ocean for food and energy production is an emerging area of research in different countries around the world. This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the “Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre”. To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia's unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {In recent years, the interest in the study of seas and oceans has dramatically increased as they are considered of primary importance for forecasting catastrophic events or for supporting blue economy, as well as the marine tourism, improving the tourist reception or enhancing any marine-related activity. This led to the development of IT platforms that allow to monitor the marine environment and provide a number of services to different kinds of final users, whether they are private individuals interested in the status of the seas, or companies whose business depends on the marine environmental monitoring. The main limitations of current platforms are due to such a difference between free trials, which often focus only on specific aspects of deep waters, and subscriptions, which provide analyzes whose reliability is generally not proportional to the costs. This paper presents SmartWave, a project funded by Regione Sicilia (European Regional Development Fund), that aims to develop a novel IT platform to observe and predict phenomena that characterize the marine environment, while also providing the consumer with a unified portal to collect, access and analyze marine-related information. To achieve this goal, one of the main challenges of this project is to aggregate and standardize heterogeneous data from multiple sources in order to offer very accurate information to private or business consumers. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Effective fisheries management is necessary for the long-term sustainability of fisheries and the economic benefits that they provide, but focusing only on ecological sustainability risks disregarding ultimate goals related to well-being that must be achieved through broader social policy. An analysis of global landings data shows that average fishing wages in 36%–67% of countries, home to 69%–95% of fishers worldwide, are likely below their nationally determined minimum living wage (which accounts for costs of food, shelter, clothing, health and education). Furthermore, even if all fisheries in every country were perfectly managed to achieve their Maximum Sustainable Yield, a common sustainability target, average incomes of fishers in up to 49 countries—70% of fishers worldwide—would still not meet minimum living wages. Access to decent work and livelihoods are fundamental human rights, including for all fisherfolk around the world, and strategies to support their well-being must therefore integrate a much wider set of perspectives, disciplines and institutions. Key first steps for fisheries researchers are to more fully recognize and estimate fisheries benefits to households—including income from women and/or alternative employment, unreported landings, or shadow values of subsistence catch—and to help identify and learn from economic equity outcomes in rebuilt fisheries around the world. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

In the recent years, it has steadily multiplied attractiveness amongst vacationers in Asia especially in the countries of South East Asia and the Far East. The wave of cruise tourism has also touched Bangladesh, which has ample scope and opportunity to improve this promising sector. The fast growth of river and ocean cruise and geographic expansion has amplified the traveling involvedness rising the financial, socio-economic, ecological and cultural impacts. Consequently, the significance of cruise improvement must be evaluated on how it marks initially to society in a travel destination. It is a descriptive investigation and the study was grounded on together primary and secondary sources to study consequences, which would highlight on the following features: instituting a 24X7 visitor service point, ensuring a wide-ranging logistic facilities associated with cruise tourism, welcoming overseas cruise line operators to scrutinize exceptional sights in Bangladesh, collaborating with other Asian nations, forming a distinctive management division, along with development and emerging exclusive resources related with the travel and tourism sector of Bangladesh. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Recently, blended finance has received increased attention as a way to create biodiversity markets and attract private capital. Building on qualitative research on efforts to create markets for private investments in marine conservation, this paper analyses how an ensemble of non-governmental organisations, development finance institutions and philanthropists seek to fill the financing gap for marine conservation in the “Blue Economy” by using blended finance as a guiding principle. I argue that by offsetting the uncertainties related to investing in a new conservation finance space, blended finance is applied as a way to fix investors’ fictional expectations and gradually transform uncertainty in risk. In doing so, this paper contributes to the literature on for-profit biodiversity conservation by highlighting how capital's risk interpretations are constitutive of the effort to create new markets. While blended finance is applied to create new markets from below, I discuss two other possible futures that might emerge as blended finance is applied in this new frontier. On the one hand, it risks becoming a development rent that is captured by the financial sector. On the other hand, blended finance can become a technical solution that enables the maintenance of a primordial faith in market-based environmental governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Abstract—One of the modern global trends is the accelerated formation of a “blue economy” based on transport and logistics, resource and raw materials, and other opportunities of the seas and oceans, which occupy more than 70% of the Earth’s surface. The article substantiates the growth in the importance of maritime economic activity for the Russian Federation and emphasizes the peculiarities of realizing its interests in the World Ocean, taking into account foreign policy, marketing and economic, technical and technological, financial and investment, infrastructural, and institutional opportunities and limitations. Attention is focused on the factors and features of the dynamics and spatial localization of such important industries for Russia as seaports and logistics, hydrocarbon production on sea shelves, production and processing of marine biological resources, shipbuilding, and coastal industry. It is shown that, on the one hand, Russia’s sphere of potential (declared) interests is the waters of the entire World Ocean and, on the other, the country’s maritime activity has a predominantly Circumeurasian (delimiting the mainland confined to its marginal seas) character, consistently shifting (under the influence of climatic, market, and geopolitical factors) into the Arctic, as well as the coastal zones and water areas of the Far East. The maritime interests of the leading Russian companies (Gazprom, Rosneft, Lukoil, NOVATEK, Rosatom and Rosatomflot, Sovkomflot, Norilsk Nickel, etc.) are emphasized, an inventory of limiting factors and the risks of further maritime orientation of the Russian economy has been compiled, and the most important areas of Russia’s presence in regions of the World Ocean in conditions of growing geopolitical turbulence and geoeconomic competition are identified. As specific results, we should single out the well-substantiated priority directions of Russia’s presence in the World Ocean, as well as the main priorities and directions for building up an effective Russian presence there. The identified limiting factors and limitations of maritime activity in modern Russia are of particular interest. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

By considering the overlap between the two sustainability frameworks it is possible to identify specific sectors and activities within the BE that also fit the operationalised criteria for NbS. Undertaking this process for one sector of the BE (aquaculture) has provided evidence that aquaculture activities, if planned and operated within the criteria, would qualify as NbS and as such may unlock financing for the provision of ecosystem services. © Copyright © 2021 Hughes.},

	abstract = {Increasing the production of food from the ocean is seen as a pathway toward more sustainable and healthier human diets. Yet this potential is being overshadowed by competing uses of ocean resources in an accelerating “blue economy.” The current emphasis on production growth, rather than equitable distribution of benefits, has created three unexamined or flawed assumptions that growth in the blue economy will lead to growth in “blue food” production, increased production will inevitably lead to improved food and nutrition security, and mariculture production will replace marine capture fisheries. In this perspective, we argue that if research and policies are pursued without addressing these “blind spots,” blue food contributions to reducing hunger and malnutrition, and to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, will be limited. Taking a broader food-system approach beyond production to also considering food access, affordability, and consumption will refocus the blue food agenda on making production and consumption more equitable and sustainable while increasing access for those who need it most. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.; Food from the ocean can help diets become more sustainable and healthy. Competition between food production and other marine sectors for resources and space limits the ability of “blue food” to improve diets. Established assumptions that blue economy growth leads to blue food growth, increased production equals food and nutrition security, and mariculture will replace capture fisheries need further investigation.

	abstract = {According to the European Commission, aquaculture is among those maritime sectors contributing to the blue economy due to its potential for generating jobs, business opportunities and, most importantly, for ensuring food security in Europe. In 2014, EU member states set new strategies to support sustainable aquaculture and ambitious targets of productions to be met by 2020 in the three segments, marine fish, freshwater fish and shellfish. A recent assessment made by the European Commission concludes that some countries might not be able to attain the established goals and this paper presents an in-depth analysis of such strategies to identify the social constraints hampering aquaculture growth in France, Italy and Spain as well as the measures established to overcome them. Most of the identified issues are related to the social acceptability of local communities, local stakeholders and consumers, suggesting that this still represents an unsolved issue hampering aquaculture development in Europe. In fact, our results show that (a) the sector suffers from a bad image related to its environmental impacts; (b) a lack of integrated spatial planning is leading to increasing conflicts with other activities; and (c) there is predominance of top-down consultation mechanisms. It is concluded that there is not a single solution to enhance social acceptability of aquaculture since this depends on a number of social, economic and environmental factors that may differ from site to site, and countries need to adopt a more integrated approach where concerns of local communities and stakeholders are understood and taken into account. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

	abstract = {The term ‘Blue Economy (BE)’ is increasingly popular in modern environmental research. The concept seeks to explore ocean-based development opportunities with environmental stewardship and protection. Yet different scholars and actors adopt this term often in conflicting ways without attempting to explore the relevance and the link between the blue economy and the broader environment viz., total environment. The potential opportunities to resolve the conflicts require a better understanding of the impacts and/or interactions of the BE on the total environment. This paper aims to map the interface between the two for a better understanding of the total environment and implications for the BE. Using a systematic literature review, this study finds that the field of the blue economy in association with the total environment is very new and emerging in the literature, and the link between the BE and the total environment is increasingly being invoked, yet clarity on the link or interactions remain vague. By analysing the co-occurrence of selected keywords and networks, we present six clusters (three for general relationship, and the other three for specific dimensions of total environment). In a general relationship between the BE and the total environment, clusters of environmental sustainability, marine resource, and economic development are identified to link directly to the BE. In specific dimensions of the total environment, clusters of growth and sustainable development, spatial planning and environmental management, and environmental sustainability and the BE are presented. The analysis outcomes show that specific areas from the total environment (growth, spatial planning, environmental management, and environmental sustainability) are directly linked to the BE where a call for a wider range of studies in the future is identified. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {After the permanent demarcation of Exclusive Economic Zone boundaries with Myanmar and India through the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Bangladesh has exclusive rights to exploit and to explore marine resources across 118,813 km2 in the Bay of Bengal. To reap economic benefits from maritime space, the government of Bangladesh recently emphasized the development of a blue economy. Maritime economic activities, including shipping, trade, fishing, fishing industries, mineral extraction, exploitation of hydrocarbons, salt production, production of renewable energy, and marine and coastal tourism, are key elements of the maritime interests of policymakers. However, the safety of maritime activities also raises concerns that include shipping accidents, smuggling, and illegal fishing, which pose threats to maritime interests. Enhancing blue economic growth and protecting marine and coastal environments are essential to ensure maritime security. Therefore, in the framework of a comprehensive ocean governance approach, we suggest establishing a separate Ministry of Ocean Affairs with essential functions to formulate an integrated coastal and marine strategy, to address the policy guidelines, and to implement action plans for coastal management in Bangladesh. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},
