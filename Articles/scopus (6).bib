	abstract = {The underexplored biodiversity of seaweeds has recently drawn great attention from researchers to find the bioactive compounds that might contribute to the growth of the blue economy. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of seasonal growth (from May to September) on the in vitro antioxidant (FRAP, DPPH, and ORAC) and antimicrobial effects (MIC and MBC) of Cystoseira compressa collected in the Central Adriatic Sea. Algal compounds were analyzed by UPLC-PDA-ESI-QTOF, and TPC and TTC were determined. Fatty acids, among which oleic acid, palmitoleic acid, and palmitic acid were the dominant compounds in samples. The highest TPC, TTC and FRAP were obtained for June extract, 83.4 ± 4.0 mg GAE/g, 8.8 ± 0.8 mg CE/g and 2.7 ± 0.1 mM TE, respectively. The highest ORAC value of 72.1 ± 1.2 µM TE was obtained for the August samples, and all samples showed extremely high free radical scavenging activity and DPPH inhibition (>80%). The MIC and MBC results showed the best antibacterial activity for the June, July and August samples, when sea temperature was the highest, against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enteritidis. The results show C. compressa as a potential species for the industrial production of nutraceuticals or functional food ingredients. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We utilize critical discourse analysis to explain how the most dominant concepts of the blue economy somewhat reflect the position of the Montenegrin state along its path between EU accession, economic revival and its political past as a substantial drawback. By researching the complex theoretical aspects of the blue economy in literature, we apply discourse theory in the analysis of the ‘Montenegrin narrative’ to examine how discourse analysis reveals the specificities of Montenegro as far as its path towards the blue economy is concerned. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that the coastal zone attracts human populations like no other. There is ever increasing demand on the coastal zone by tourists, residents and developers alike; it is named as the fastest growing sector of the blue economy. Hence, coastal zone processes require better understanding to be effectively managed in the context of sustainable development of the asset. While sea level may be rising over the long-term, and many global-resolution studies lament the loss of sandy beaches as a result, coastal managers work over far shorter time-scales thus require site specific information to manage the coastal zone on a daily and monthly basis. In this contribution we discuss nine years of morphological change along a sandy beach in Durban, South Africa. The beach is managed by the eThekwini Municipality who are responsible for maintaining a coastal zone of ca. 100 km. The morphological data of this study were collected on a near monthly basis over 9.6 km of sandy beach between October 2011 and March 2020. From these data, beach volume and area are calculated and the variation is documented over time in conjunction with wave data recorded from a proximal directional wave buoy. Over the study period, the beach has experienced a net loss of 177885m3 and 29,375 m2 in volume and area respectively. However, the beach response has not been uniform throughout the study area. The southern three-quarters of the beach were affected by significant losses while the northern one-quarter gained in volume and area over the same period. The summer wave climate is characterised by increased variability in swell origin with greater easterly contributions than other seasons, and typically lacks the frequency of large swell (>3.5 m) events (7% of events) common to autumn (20%), winter (35%) and spring (38%). Winter, followed by spring then autumn seasons have more focused swell origins and southerly contribution, particularly in terms of large swell events. During periods of reduced event frequency allow for partial beach recovery, while erosion is associated with periods of increase event frequency. The sediment budget has been significantly reduced though impoundments on the proximal river catchment, compounded by un-managed sand mining. Rather than sea level, these near-field controls on sediment availability likely play a major role in beach volume and area in response to wave climate. There is less sediment available to nourish the beach naturally following erosional events; artificial nourishment will likely be required to maintain the sandy beach in the future. © 2021},

	abstract = {Blue Growth has become one of the key topics of ocean management. It is defined as a holistic framework for an environmentally friendly and socio-economically sustainable development of ocean-related activities with a special emphasis on technological innovation. Capture fisheries are widely considered to have no substantial growth potential and consequently are not subject to the European Union’s Blue Growth strategy. In our review, we, however, argue that capture fisheries should play an essential role in national Blue Growth strategies. We identified two interconnected management strategies to foster Blue Growth in fisheries, a) the implementation of Community Development Quota (CDQ) systems and b) the support of small-scale fisheries (SSF). They hold the potential to benefit fishery-dependent coastal communities and therefore counteract consolidations in the fishing sector. Additionally, they provide the possibility to improve quota access for small-scale fishermen. Besides having better access to quota, the future of SSF depends on sources of public funding for technical improvement and innovation as well as increased representation in the management. In this perspective, we present different cases that successfully implemented CDQs (the Alaska pollock fishery) or have considerable potential to implement CDQ programs or improve their current approaches (United Kingdom, Ireland, and Iceland). We further discuss examples for successful management strategies to support SSF directly. If these aspects are considered in a Blue Growth strategy, the survival of fishery-dependent communities could be assured, and SSF could develop from predominantly part-time or subsistence fisheries to a full-time occupation. By those means, they would be part of a fostering Blue Economy and strengthen environmentally friendly and socio-economically sustainable fishing practices in Europe.

	abstract = {Seafood production in required quantities is facing increasing pressures due to reasons such as rising population, increasing demand, overfishing, landing of by-catch, climate change-related biodiversity changes, extinction of species and others. At the same time, industrial production of value added fishery products generates significant amounts of nutrient-rich discards, besides voluminous amount of process effluents. These discards, by-catch and effluents are rich sources of nutrients, industrially important ingredients and also bio-energy. Developments in marine biotechnology offer novel eco- friendly green processes for bio-refining of discarded seafood portions. This article discusses potentials of green processing for the valorization of seafood discards and process effluents towards zero waste that can improve sustainable seafood supply chain. The green processes generally make use of bioconversions of discards to release components attached to food matrices, which are extracted by suitable downstream processing techniques. Algal biotechnology and biorefinery-based approaches have significant scope for commercial scale processing of seafood discards. Because of their functional nature, the isolated products can have valuable applications in health, therapeutic and industries in other fields. Green processing can encourage zero-waste seafood processing, environmental protection, blue economy and has potential to realize the Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) of the United nations, particularly the SDG #12.3. © 2022 The Author},

This article aims to review opportunities and strategies in realizing the blue economy by empowering coastal communities in the Sumatra. The method was a qualitative exploratory method with SWOT and combined with SSM analysis. The data sources were obtained through secondary data from literature studies, comparisons through multi institutions data. The study found that community empowerment can be done by considering the potential of fishery resources and the community's interest in managing the fisheries sub-sector. The development of national food barns should be focused on the Blue Economy sector and can be started through the Sumatra region. Stakeholder synergy can be integrated in fostering, supervising and mobilizing coastal communities in supporting their welfare.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Important actions that have been identified in support of sustainable development goals include capacity-building, training, and education. This includes educational opportunities for ocean-based renewable energy development in support of a healthy planet and ocean. Offshore wind is experiencing rapid development globally and, while the U.S. offshore wind market is still nascent, it is on the brink of exponential growth based on large cost reductions driven largely by European development and technology advances. Growth is also expected in wave and tidal energy with significant opportunities identified for various distributed markets through the Powering the Blue Economy™ initiative, with longer-term implications for expansion at the utility scale (LiVecchi et al 2019 Powering the blue economy; exploring opportunities for marine renewable energy in maritime markets p 207). In order to expedite progress and maximize benefits to the national, state, and local economies, these development actions will require a broad, diverse, and appropriately trained workforce. The ocean-based renewable energy workforce needs engineers and scientists to develop cost-effective technologies, as well as trade and maritime workers to eventually deploy the technologies at scale. In the United States, educational institutions, state governments, and private developers are taking action to understand job skills and capability requirements and to develop educational and training programs to meet offshore workforce needs; most are focused on offshore wind power, with gaining interest in marine energy. This article explores the workforce requirements of the growing ocean-based renewable energy industry and the current state of education and training programs to meet those requirements in order to identify gaps and make recommendations for further workforce development activities and initiatives. An international view needs to be adopted that incorporates the education and skill needs of early-stage marine energy technologies and evolving offshore wind technologies together with more market-ready offshore renewable energy markets. By accelerating educational development opportunities in ocean-based renewable energy, these growing blue economy markets can deliver significant economic and social benefits. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The sustainable use of fisheries resources is a priority of the African Union in developing the Blue Economy (BE). Growing global demand for seafood has attracted diverse actors to African waters, including Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs) fleets. Complex fisheries governance challenges, unsustainable rates of fishing and rising fisheries-related crimes have ensued. To reverse these impacts, some African states are deploying various fisheries governance mechanisms. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, the review of literature, fisheries databases, international and regional agency reports, NGO and government reports and case studies from West and East Africa, we demonstrate two critical findings. First, fisheries governance mechanisms in Africa act largely to constrain small-scale fisheries (SSF) while failing to contain the industrial fisheries sector, resulting in the marginalisation of the SSF. Secondly, despite a higher incidence of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in industrial fisheries than the SSF, fisheries governance mechanisms continue to advance the 'Survival of the Richest' – the industrial sector, to the detriment of the 'Fittest' – the SSF. The SSF supports millions of jobs and is better adapted to meet the continents' nutrition and socio-economic security. For the fisheries sector to contribute to the sustainable development of Africans, states must redirect governance towards regulating the industrial sector, emphasising equitable access for the SSF whilst prioritising ecological sustainability. © 2021 The Authors},

Founded on the pillars of sustainability, the basis of the blue economy, there is harmony between the regulatory scales, although the lack of management capacity, the dysfunctions due to the absence of legal order and its environmental impact determine sustainable development.

The paper contributes to the emerging literature on the development of a participative BE by presenting an innovative Quadruple Helix model, which not only connects domestic government, academia, firms and users but acts as a driver boosting the foreign exposure of the country in this specific domain. The model is tested in Qingdao, an exemplary city included in the Blue Economic Zone of the Shandong Province in China, through an exploratory approach based on desk research integrated with semi-structured interviews with eight experts. The findings suggest that Qingdao is built on a Triple Helix where the government holds a leading role in defining the domestic and international activities of academia and businesses, as in the case of the Blue Silicon Valley and the Qingdao West Coast New Area. Contrary, structures and practices fostering the involvement of civil society were not retrieved, even if projects to develop a sustainable Quadruple Helix model are expected by exploiting international collaboration. Furthermore, the findings show that to promote international partnerships in BE it is imperative to define a common and shared language at the global level. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Voluntary (or non-binding) commitments offer an action-oriented mechanism for addressing interconnected, complex and pressing issues. Though not designed to replace negotiated or binding outcomes, voluntary commitments can offer a critical tool in currently ungoverned or under-governed systems. The Blue Economy is an example of a rapidly evolving agenda where formal governance arrangements are at best nascent, in part due to the trans-border nature of issues and prominent involvement of multiple types of actors. As such voluntary commitments provide an important mechanism through which to monitor the evolution of the concept and identify gaps or shortfalls in its implementation. Our analysis of global voluntary commitments on the Blue Economy made to recent high-profile ocean futures meetings, found a trend towards capacity development, research, and investment in emerging and larger scale sectors such as offshore aquaculture and renewable energy. A concurrent focus was on securitizing, regulating or diverting effort from historically significant fisheries sectors. European organizations are playing a dominant role in Blue Economy commitments, with a notable absence of commitments from major Blue Economy powers such as China and India. We identify a number of gaps and shortfalls, particularly in relation to active consideration of social equity in the Blue Economy. We identify a range of recommendations on how these deficiencies may be addressed through a greater focus on a broader suite of objectives and a more inclusive approach to ocean meetings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper presents initial results from converting plastic marine litter processed as-is, without pretreatment, and sorting into marine gas oil (MGO) compliant with the ISO8217 DMA standard via a pyrolysis and distillation process. Yields, composition and key properties of products along with levels of eight environmental contaminants potentially generated by the process are presented. More than 100 kg of actual marine litter from the Venice Lagoon, including polyolefins packaging and polyamides fishing nets, were converted into products at approximately 45 wt% yield of which approximately 50% (V/V) was MGO. By our knowledge, this is the first report of chemical recycling of real marine litter targeting the production of standardized marine fuels beyond laboratory scale, outlining coarse but realistic figures finally available as an initial benchmark. The process supports the concept of circularity in the blue economy and could be employed to tackle difficult terrestrial plastic waste to help prevent marine litter generation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the successful commercialization of cell-based seafood requires the adoption of the regulation on product labelling. This article explores the trademarks issues of cell-based foods specifically and whether these types of intellectual property rights can contribute to the promotion of sustainable fisheries in the so-called 'blue economy'. It examines the extent to which international trademark protection has the ability to contribute to better ocean governance by accommodating higher public policy imperatives, the recent case law on Article 20 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, and the newly adopted 'justifiability test' for special requirements as they apply to trademarks. It appraises some of the legal implications for the regulatory design of domestic labelling regulation as they apply to cell-based seafood.  Copyright © 2022 by Mariela de Amstalden.},

	abstract = {Background: The Blue Economy is a recent field of study that encompasses economic activities that depend on the sea, often associated with other economic sectors, including tourism, maritime transport, energy and fishing. Blue growth supports the sustainable growth of the maritime and marine sectors as the oceans and seas are engines of the global economy and have great potential for growth and innovation. This article undertakes a bibliometric analysis in the terms of Blue Economy (BE), Maritime Economy (MAE), Ocean Economy (OE), Marine Economy (ME), and Blue Growth (BG) to analyze the scientific production of this field of study. Analysis of the authors’ definitions of BE, BG, ME and OE provides interesting relationships divided into sustainability and governance; economics and ecosystem protection; industrial development and localization; and the growth of the ocean economy, with development as the central axis that encompasses them. The main contribution is to find out if there is a link between the BE and the CE through the keyword study. Results: The results show a significant increase in articles and citations over the last decade. The articles address the importance of different sectors of BE and the interest of governments in promoting it for the development of their national economies. Using bibliometric mapping tools (VOSviewer), it is possible to find possible links between concepts such as CE and BE through the BG and to visualize trending topics for future research. Nascent and future research trends include terms such as small-scale fisheries, aquatic species, biofuel, growth of the coastal BE, internationalization and blue degrowth (BD), the latter approaches aspects of BG from a critical perspective. Conclusions: In conclusion, it highlights the need for alliances between the sectors that compose BG with the incorporation of the CE in order to achieve a sustainable BE in both developed and developing countries. Through the keyword analysis it is shown that the BG strategy is the bridge between the BE and the CE. The CE presents itself as a promising alternative that could mitigate tensions between stakeholders who support both growth and degrowth positions. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The blue economy has become an influential concept in international and national marine governance discourse. Various contested interpretations exist, and different actors choose to emphasise different aspects of the triple goal of environmental, economic, and social improvements. However, despite disagreement over its interpretations, the blue economy finds support in many different arenas. This paper explores the position of dominance that the blue economy has reached, and examines how supporters of the concept maintain and employ power to keep it relevant. The paper applies a mixed-methods approach: 29 semi-structured interviews with people in roles of formal decision-making across the fisheries sector, economic development and tourism sector, conservation and environment sector, and specific blue economy-institutions are supplemented by observations from the wider landscape during 4 months of fieldwork in Seychelles. Findings show that in international discourse, the blue economy obtains and maintains its influence through persuasion and through the construction of a ‘common sense’ and productive way forward, capable of achieving triple wins. Within this narrative, oceans are undergoing a reconfiguration as economic frontiers, and the blue economy places economic growth from oceans centrally within contemporary environmental governance. Maintaining the blue economy as a powerful concept on the ground is done through social power relations: the blue economy functions as a boundary object, contributing to depoliticisation of discussions about a shared vision. Depoliticisation allows Seychelles to continue using the concept despite simmering dissent among policy makers, practitioners, and resource users. Dominance of the blue economy on the international stage means that associating with it brings Seychelles visibility and influence. The usefulness of the concept in eliding tensions makes it difficult for counter-hegemony to arise, although alternatives are emerging elsewhere, such as blue justice. However, fundamental change is needed to re-politicise environmental decision-making and explicitly discuss values and images attached to the blue economy. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems provide a wide range of goods and services that directly and indirectly benefit economies and support human health and wellbeing. However, these ecosystems are vulnerable to anthropogenic influences such as climate change, pollution and habitat destruction. The European Union (EU) recognises the role of the blue economy in providing jobs and contributing to economic growth, with the EU Integrated Maritime Policy being a cross-sectoral framework within which maritime activities are managed and coordinated. Sustainability is a central tenet, ensuring that sectors such as aquaculture and offshore wind energy, which are earmarked for growth, must develop in ways that do not negatively impact the health of the marine environment. However, there is currently little consideration of how these activities might impact public health. The current research used survey data from 14 European countries to explore public perceptions of these issues, broadly focusing on 10 maritime activities, with a specific focus on five activities related to the EU's 2012 Blue Growth Strategy. The respondents appreciated the interconnections between these maritime activities, environmental protection and public health, as well as the potential trade-offs. Preferences for policy intervention to protect public health from different activities were predicted by both marine contact (marine sector employment, recreational activities) and socio-demographic (political attitudes, gender, age) variables, potentially aiding future engagement and communication initiatives. Substantive differences observed across countries in terms of policy preferences for different activities, however, warn against generalising for the European population as a whole. © 2021 The Authors},

To be successful in these efforts, they have been pushing technological development which in turn has increased the demand for power as most of these developments are power hungry. However, with the present power generation knowledge confined to fossil-fuel, achieving sustainability has been limited and a challenge to achieve. To overcome this limitation and to harness the full potential of the ocean-based Blue Economy, countries around the world, including India, are making concerted efforts to develop sustainable technologies to generate usable power from ocean-energy. Accordingly, the options available for utilising ocean-based renewable energy technologies to sustainably power growth through economic activities in the marine and coastal domain while being a meaningful contributor to the blue economic growth is discussed. In doing so, a global perspective of the status of the Blue Economy of marine renewable energy technologies with a focus on the opportunities for India has been provided.

	abstract = {The ocean is currently an extremely large and under-developed source of renewable energy. The recent interest in the Blue Economy has led the scientific community to increase investigations in sustainable oceanic energy options, such as Point Wave Energy Converters (WEC). These devices harvest the wave energy using the excited oscillatory motion of the buoy, which is connected to a Power Take-Off system (PTO). During the last decades, the development of these devices has been boosted but they are still behind other renewable energy technologies. The Furthlab at Texas A&M University has showed that the spheroid buoy shape with a low length to diameter ratio is a good candidate shape to extract wave energy, by testing different buoy shapes and aspect ratios at a non-linear Stokes-II wave generation. This paper is the next step in our research and numerically investigates the effect of changing the wave characteristics, such as amplitude, frequency, and speed, on the power-generating ability of the spheroid buoy system. Three-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of the selected buoy were performed in OpenFOAM with the integration of a dynamic mesh module to handle the heave motion of the buoy. In addition, the PTO system was compensated with a forced oscillator mechanism of spring and damper. A comparison between the buoy’s displacement and frequency responses, and power efficiency showed the optimal operating sea state to maximize energy output using the spheroid WEC. The results conclude that the best wave conditions to maximize the power extraction efficiency using a spheroid buoy with a diameter of 1 m and length of 0.5 m are wave length greater than 4 m, wave height less than 0.15 m, and wave speed between 0.07 and 0.12 m/s.

International efforts to address these challenges include the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda. Further, some countries are refocusing their ocean programs to align with blue economy strategies globally. We look to Canada, an ocean nation developing a blue economy strategy, to examine the climate-responsiveness of their oceans policies. First, we identify climate change impacts on ecosystem services affecting each of Canada's coasts through a document scan. Then, through a structured policy analysis, we examine whether Canadian fisheries and oceans policy are responsive to these impacts. Finally, we discuss how current policies do or do not address climate impacts on oceans and coasts in Canada, and how this focus, or lack thereof, will have an outsized impact on certain ocean sectors (e.g., inshore fisheries). Our findings show a policy landscape largely dependent on climate change action promoted in a few broad federal initiatives, with oceans-related climate action operating through area-based conservation measures and research and monitoring initiatives. We conclude with recommendations for Canada and similar ocean states to integrate climate and ocean policies across federal departments and ocean sectors by centering vulnerable coastal users in policy formulation.

	abstract = {The Mediterranean islands’ blue economy and, more specifically, the tourism sector, largely regulate Europe’s gross product. Climate change threatens the ecological, societal, and economic sustainability of the islands in many ways, with increasing wildfires making up one of the most critical components of the climate change impacts on tourism. Here, we aim to identify and assess forest fire vulnerability and risk due to climate change for seven Mediterranean islands through the application of the “impact chain” conceptual framework. The backbone of this approach requires the integration of quantitative and qualitative data according to the three main risk components sensu the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), i.e., hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, with a structured participatory approach involving stakeholders and experts. Our results illustrate the islands with high potential for improvement in terms of adapting capacity and, by indicating the contribution of the different risk components, highlight the main environmental and socio-economic elements that affect the islands’ vulnerability and risk under climate change. The approach’s potentials and constraints are discussed, suggesting that the method can be handily used to point out the priorities that must be addressed by mitigation and adaptation policies and measures at the island level. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {A major paradigm shift is underway globally, a revolution in our relationship with the ocean. From cavalier exploitation of offshore resources spurred on by dreams of infinite wealth, nations now recognize a thriving ocean economy needs a healthy ocean. Past events brought global attention to the impressive rise in offshore revenue generated by the Blue Economy. In 2021, ocean values were estimated at $2.5 trillion annually (Sumaila et al., 2021). The advent of ex-clusive economic zones enhanced by technological innovations led to rapid in-creases in off shore commercial and industrial activities, accompanied unfortunately by mismanaged and overexploited resources. The resultant decline in ocean health from unsustainable practices, compounded by climate-related im-pacts, provided the momentum toward sustainable strategies for development, institutionalized by the 2016 United Nations (UN) Conference on Sustainable Development and the resultant Sustainable Development Goals. National practices expanded categories of original estimates of ocean gross domestic product, formerly based solely on National Income Accounts to include environmental and non-market assets, revealing a more accurate net estimate of the ocean’s values. The New Blue Economy, or knowledge-based economy, has been in large part responsible for economists’ ability to capture environmental and non-market values, allowing this paradigm shift toward a sustainable world to occur. The NBE generates the rapid pace of scientific discovery and technological innovations that facilitated those discoveries through advanced measurement and analytical tools. The latest UN declaration, the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable De-velopment, solidifies the future of this positive paradigm shift. © 2022, Marine Technology Society Inc..

Using the methods of morphological analysis, thematic analysis, and structural analysis, this article identifies and reports on six innovation concepts for the electrification of the seas: Charging at wind farms; Charging at fish farms; Charging at thermal-powered platforms; Charging by floating solar panels; Charging at tidal plants; Charging at offshore container terminals. This article provides a base for entrepreneurship by generating insight into the affecting variables for each configuration as well as the identification of the strategic variables. It furthermore contributes a novel methodological approach to produce said understanding.

Though there is a vast diversity of macroalgal species along the coastal states of India, they are not fully explored for their nutraceutical benefits. In this study, the antioxidant and antiglycemic properties along with its polysaccharide and total phenolic content of fifteen selected macroalgae from the Indian coast was evaluated. The antioxidant activity was assessed based on the radical scavenging and reducing power efficiency and the antiglycemic activity was determined based on its α-glucosidase inhibition capacity. The results show that Pterocladia capillacea (Rhodophyta) and Stoechospermum marginatum and Sphacelaria rigidula (Phaeophyta) exhibited good antioxidant and antiglycemic activity, equivalent to model compounds. Statistical analysis shows a highly significant correlation between both these activities and the total phenolic content. Characterizing the bioactivity can benefit the current generation as they are greatly affected by various chronic diseases due to oxidative stress. Exploring the macroalgae can provide potential natural alternatives, which are of great demand in the healthcare industry and pave way for its sustainable utilization for creating the Blue Economy. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Heavy metal pollution is still present in the Danube River basin, due to intensive naval and agricultural activities conducted in the area. Therefore, continuous monitoring of this pivotal aquatic macro-system is necessary, through the development and optimization of monitoring meth-odologies. The main objective of the present study was to develop a prediction model for heavy metals accumulation in biological tissues, based on field gathered data which uses bioindicators (fish) and oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers. Samples of water and fish were collected from the lower sector of Danube River (DR), Danube Delta (DD) and Black Sea (BS). The following indicators were analyzed in samples: cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) (in water and fish tissues), respectively, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) (in fish tissues). The pollution index (PI) was calculated to identify the most polluted studied ecosystem, which revealed that Danube River is seriously affected by the presence of Fe (IP = 4887) and strongly affected by the presence of Zn (IP = 4.49). The concentration of Cd in fish muscle tissue was above the maximum permitted level (0.05 µg/g) by the EU regula-tion. From all analyzed OS biomarkers, MDA registered the highest median values in fish muscle (145.7 nmol/mg protein in DR, 201.03 nmol/mg protein in DD, 148.58 nmol/mg protein in BS) and fish liver (200.28 nmol/mg protein in DR, 163.67 nmol/mg protein, 158.51 nmol/mg protein), com-pared to CAT, SOD and GPx. The prediction of Cd, Pb, Zn, Fe and Cu in fish hepatic and muscle tissue was determined based on CAT, SOD, GPx and MDA, by using non-linear tree-based RF prediction models. The analysis emphasizes that MDA in hepatic tissue is the most important inde-pendent variable for predicting heavy metals in fish muscle and tissues at BS coast, followed by GPx in both hepatic and muscle tissues. The RF analytical framework revealed that CAT in muscle tissue, respectively, MDA and GPx in hepatic tissues are most common predictors for determining the heavy metals concentration in both muscle and hepatic tissues in DD area. For DR, the MDA in muscle, followed by MDA in hepatic tissue are the main predictors in RF analysis. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In 2006 the European Union (EU) began a dramatic change in its conception and approach to maritime policy. By developing what was called Integrated Maritime Policy, there was an attempt to coordinate different sectorial policies and thus adding value, through synergies and economies of scale. At the same time, and as a result of scientific and technological advances, five strategic sectors with great growth potential were identified: aquaculture, renewable energies, blue biotechnology, deep sea mining, and nautical tourism. These were the pillars for the Blue Growth Strategy, leading to more jobs and global economic growth. This trend quickly spread to other continents, universalising the concept of blue growth. However, the growing competition for maritime space, due to new uses, led to the realisation that along with the need to ensure confidence and stability for investors, it would be imperative to develop new planning and management instruments for these spaces. During this process, governments quickly realised that this evolution, which had the potential for far reaching economic and social impacts, required a new institutional framework adapted to this new reality, which would end up having an impact on the governments structure itself. We have witnessed, particularly during the last decade, a profound conceptual change in the governance of maritime space. The design of new political, legal, institutional, and governmental frameworks, which are introducing a new model of maritime and marine governance at a global scale, are probably the most critical one since World War II. This article develops this analysis, based on several examples, both in the EU as well as in other countries outside the bloc, particularly those surrounding the Atlantic, in order to demonstrate that the drive towards a blue economy triggered a profound and deep change in marine policies and governance. © Copyright © 2021 Guerreiro.},

	abstract = {Understanding the economic value of marine sanctuaries such as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) is important to justify public and private investments and to provide information to support management activities and understand their role in the nation’s blue economy. Very few studies have employed economic contribution analysis in examining economic value, even though it is more useful in influencing the behaviors of decision makers. This study therefore employs such a methodology to determine the economic importance of tourism and visitor spending in the sanctuary to Monroe County, Florida’s economy. Visitors who came to the area for ocean recreation and tourism spent a total of USD 1.7 billion, which translates to a contribution of 19,688 total jobs, USD 752 million in total labor income, USD 1.2 billion in total value added, and USD 2 billion in total output to the region. With regard to the spending of snorkelers and divers only, total spending is about USD 1.07 billion, contributing about 12,441 total jobs, USD 466 million in total labor income, USD 767 million in total value added, and USD 1.2 billion in total output. Ocean recreation is therefore an important economic driver in the region and efforts should be directed at protecting the diverse and sensitive ecosystem of the sanctuary. © 2022 by the authors.

Understanding the services and goods of deep-sea ecosystems would enable better resource governance and decision-making. In the present study, we reviewed and assessed deep-sea ecosystems services using the Ma conceptual framework, which incorporates ecosystems services and goods with human welfare. We also analyzed and measured the scientific production between 2012 and 2021 using the Dimension dataset. The bibliometric analysis showed a lack of studies related to deep-sea ecosystem services, which suggest the urgent need to overcome the existing knowledge gap regarding deep-sea components. However, the current knowledge revealed the crucial role that these ecosystems provide to the planet. Furthermore, we highlighted that there are common services and goods, and every ecosystem service feeds into another one. Developing actions and policies based on approaches that combine all deep-sea ecosystems services and goods are needed for the sustainable growth of the deep-sea economy in accordance with the United Nations Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. © 2021 by the authors.

The HLP is co-chaired by the Prime Minister of Norway and the President of Palau. Simply put, the HLP seeks to ensure a SOE worldwide. In February 2021, the #VirtualBlueDecade initiative convened a panel of ocean practitioners from both the Global South and Global North to reflect on practical ways to build a SOE. Here, we present a summary of the key issues discussed by the panel, grouped around five topics: (i) words do initiate actions; (ii) goal setting is an important step in achieving a SOE; (iii) unsustainable practices are no longer justifiable as necessary evils for funding or obtaining social license for the transformation to a SOE; (iv) scientists must learn to communicate with policy makers; and (v) support South-South cooperation. We conclude that to achieve a SOE, the concept of “Informed Selfishness” should be considered as a guiding principle for developing policies and implementing sustainability actions. © 2021},

	abstract = {Due to their insularity and small economies, several islands have become reliant on tourism activity for the livelihood of their communities. Islands of the same archipelago have faced various challenges in terms of tourism growth and related impact. Primarily, tourism has been characterised by seasonality (the strong spatio-temporal concentration of tourists in a destination) especially in the most peripheral islands. In other cases, tourism has grown considerably resulting in overemphasis on mass tourism throughout part of the year. This is largely experienced due to Sand, Sun and Sea (3S) tourism. Fieldwork, including interviews with key stakeholders and ecotours off-season, was conducted in the Aegadian Archipelago, off the west coast of Sicily. Findings revealed that ecotourism not only is the preferred alternative form of tourism among stakeholders but is also possible and ideal as confirmed through the ecotours. This is because different ecotourism activities can be practised all year round, thus mitigating seasonality. In return, this can help ease the financial, social and environmental challenges associated with current tourism models improving the well-being of local communities. Marine ecotourism is considered as a means to give more value to marine protected areas and to make existing tourism activity in the peak season more sustainable. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Due to the poor climate and construction conditions, maritime communications significantly lag behind their terrestrial counterparts, which hinders the application and optimization of maritime mobile services. Recently, the cloud-edge-terminal (CET) architecture has enabled terrestrial mobile users to use all devices and facilities collaboratively, which effectively alleviates network pressure and improves users' quality of experience (QoE). To bring these advantages to the maritime scenario, this article proposes an integrated satellite-maritime CET architecture, and considers the mobility of maritime vehicles in network resource management, including integrated transmission optimization, CET offloading, and proactive caching with resource-sharing maritime edge clusters. These proposals can provide a new perspective for future maritime network management to be more suitable for the mobility of maritime communication entities.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The mechanism of regional revitalisation emphasises exploring local DNA, characterising resources, and clarifying industrial positioning. This revitalisation may promote the return of young people to the countryside and encourage the younger generation to take over traditional industry operations. Moreover, they can innovate the design to activate idle facilities to become a local characteristic field. This revitalisation will gradually attract talent and imbue local traditional industries with new kinetic energy. With regard to this study the authors adopt the analysis method, observation method, field research and interview method. For regional revitalisation in marine and coastal waters, the Ocean Affairs Council proposes the following strategies: establishing a public–private partnership platform for marine science and technology issues, training young marine talent, addressing the cultural heritage of marine aboriginal villages, and counselling local marine specialists. As a case study, this paper analyses the situation and the development of the marine leisure revitalisation industry in the local area of Kouhu Township in Yunlin County. Meanwhile, the work has found that successful regional revitalisation need to collaborate local governments and NGOs to make good use of local DNA and to create a blue economy in local areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This renewed focus on national aquaculture legislation is supported by industry who expect that an aquaculture act will lead to streamlined regulation and state support for aquaculture production and development, but also by environmental non-governmental organizations who seek stronger regulatory governance over an industry that has a long history of socio-ecological conflicts. In this brief commentary, we identify three key challenges to the establishment of a national aquaculture act in Canada and we examine the likely impact of these challenges to the future shape and direction of aquaculture regulation, with implications that extend beyond Canada. We critically reflect on the potential implications of a weak act, one that will not overcome the ongoing socio-ecological conflicts associated with aquaculture in Canada and elsewhere. The most likely outcome will be for these conflicts and demands to be resolved in the courts, which will provide a new critical area for social science research on marine policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Coastal ocean observing and modeling systems (coastal observatories), connected with regional and global ocean systems, improve the quality of information and forecasts for effective management of safe and sustainable maritime activities. The public availability of systematic and long-term information of the ocean is an engine for the Blue Economy, boosting economic growth, employment, and innovation. An overview of some Brazilian initiatives is presented in this paper, involving universities, private companies, federal and state agencies, covering institutions from south to north of Brazil. Although these initiatives focus mainly on ocean physics, integrated efforts can extend the scope to include biogeochemistry and marine biodiversity, helping to address interdisciplinary problems. Existing initiatives can be connected, and new ones fostered, to fill in the gaps of temporal and spatial coverage of ocean monitoring in the vast oceanic area under Brazilian jurisdiction (nationally referred to as the Blue Amazon, in reference to the similar richness of the Amazon Forest). The alignment among national and regional initiatives, as well as with international programs, can be promoted if coordinated by a national-level organization, maximizing the return of public investment and socioeconomic benefits. In light of international examples, possible future institutional arrangements are discussed, leveraging from existing national public policies and international cooperation that Brazil is taking part. The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development is a timely opportunity to encourage an institutional arrangement to support and articulate an integrated network of coastal observatories in Brazil. © Copyright © 2021 Franz, Garcia, Pereira, de Freitas Assad, Rollnic, Garbossa, da Cunha, Lentini, Nobre, Turra, Trotte-Duhá, Cirano, Estefen, Lima, Paiva, Noernberg, Tanajura, Moutinho, Campuzano, Pereira, Lima, Mendonça, Nocko, Machado, Alvarenga, Martins, Böck, Toste, Landau, Miranda, dos Santos, Pellegrini, Juliano, Neves and Polejack.},

	abstract = {This study aims to describe the concept of a green economy and a blue economy in Indonesia in 2016-2020, to realize sustainable development, with indicators of poverty alleviation, employment, utilization of natural resources, and reduction of waste. The research method is qualitative-descriptive used by analyzing the news from five reputable online news media in Indonesia using NVivo 12 plus software and other literature related to research problems. The results showed that the intensity of reporting on the green economy discourse varies between each online news media, namely: labor absorption indicators are more dominant reported by Tribunnews.com and Kompas.com, natural resource management by Tempo.co, waste reduction by Detik.com, and poverty alleviation by Antaranews.com. Meanwhile, in the blue economy concept, the most dominant indicators reported are indicators of efficiency in using natural resources by Tempo.co and Kompas.com, poverty alleviation by Detik.com and Antaranews.com, and waste-free indicators by Tribunnews.com. Furthermore, word frequency analysis on the green economy concept shows that the most frequently reported topics are about the use of renewable energy, while in the blue economy concept, the most frequently discussed topics are about fish farming for sustainable food and the cleanliness of the oceans from waste. Compared to the blue economy concept, the green economy concept has been reported more by the media. However, the blue economy concept is a bit more favored because it is cheaper and more environmentally friendly/waste-free. This is because no waste is wasted at all on the concept of a blue economy. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is the most rapidly growing food production sector globally. In certain coastal social-ecological systems, this has resulted in significant changes and sustainability challenges. In particular, coastal environments which used to support only capture fisheries are becoming sites for brackish water aquaculture production; this impacts the sustainability of aquatic food production. Sustainability challenges associated with aquaculture expansion and intensification necessitate a contextually rooted understanding of institutions and institutional changes which can be used as an informed basis for leveraging institutions to achieve desirable sustainability outcomes in the aquatic food sector. This research used a qualitative empirical case study involving in-depth interviews, participant observation, and analysis of institutional documents in the region of Central Luzon, Philippines. It applied the inter-institutional systems concept which considers multiple institutions with distinct but linked purposes and functions in the societal spheres of state, market, and civil society. The study found that aquaculture emerged as an important livelihood because of rice farmers’ need to adapt to saltwater intrusion into what were formerly rice farms. It grew into an industry due to developments in the availability and accessibility of inputs such as fingerlings and feeds. This process was also driven by the high demand and high profitability of fish farming at the time. Regulatory institutions have not adequately adapted to protect the environment. Market institutions adapted but the changes mostly benefited consignacions (middlemen) and large-scale players. However, organised groups of collaborating smallholder fishers and fish farmers are helping to address the disadvantages they face. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The Blue Economy is a recent economic development paradigm, being promoted worldwide as a way to deliver sustainable ocean development in the context of the sustainable development goals. Research has drawn attention to its contested nature and the propensity of sectoral interests to co-opt it to their own ends. An emerging body of critical studies of the Blue Economy, as practiced, provides an opportunity to address the question “What is the blue economy?” in new ways. This review of published empirical case studies initiates a conversation between governmentality concepts and place-space–time theory, aiming to open new lines of enquiry regarding the influence of spatiality on the nature of governance. This approach has allowed the elucidation of a complex and nuanced understanding of the Blue Economy, complementing earlier discourse and content analyses. In relation to Blue Economy governance, I pose the specific question, “Does place matter?”, leading to an interrogation of material and spatial relations in Blue Economy governance. I describe a complex spatialised governmentality, dominated by growth-based imaginaries and market-led practices. I draw attention to the production of ocean space through socio-material Blue Economy relations and the material and spatial contingency of its governance. Finally, I draw a distinction between “place” and “location” which has important consequences for Blue Economy governance. © 2021, The Author(s).},

These deep areas extend from, in most cases <10 km from shore, have connections to shallow and coastal marine habitats through oceanographic processes, and support important living and non-living resources, which are becoming increasingly exploited to support a valuable blue economy. Recognising the need for sustainable development, implementation of conservation and management measures in Tanzania's offshore waters has begun, with the development of coastal protected areas and marine spatial plans (e.g. the Coastal and Marine Spatial Plan for Zanzibar). As yet, the deeper areas of Tanzania have not been considered in marine spatial planning. Here we present a synthesis of available data on the habitats and biological communities of deep-water Tanzania, including new data collected in collaboration with the deep-water oil and gas industry, to provide an indication of regional-scale patterns and areas of potential importance. We also discuss the value and multiple uses of the deep ocean areas to Tanzania, and assess the ecological effects of impacts in these environments. This information is valuable to the Tanzanian government to help inform development of management measures to continue to make sustainable use of valuable deep-water resources. To facilitate uptake, we provide a series of recommendations on considering the Tanzanian deep ocean areas in marine spatial planning to boost future management of the important and sensitive offshore domain. © 2021 The Authors},

The article's aim is to fill that gap, focusing on land tenure rights of coastal territory and its governance. For that purpose, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries is key to bringing the concept of the blue economy into the lives of small-scale fisheries stakeholders. The article attempts to analyse whether Chilean legislation complies with the FAO framework, particularly in the area of tenure rights over fishing inlets as well as whether this framework is accepted by those engaged in small-scale fishing. The hypothesis is that, in areas not covered by statutory law, which is mandatory, fishermen have already been intrinsically applying the FAO framework, which is voluntary. Thus, it is important to acknowledge their practices when developing legislation and legal reforms that attempt to introduce such a framework.

	abstract = {Despite being a vital asset for global sustenance and economy, ocean aquatic ecosystems are in danger due to the effects of incorrect management of their resources, pollution, and climate change. Considering the seafood industry discards half of its fish-product mass in the ocean, a proper valorization of its residues would decrease not only the ocean contamination but also improve the management of marine resources and increase the sector competitiveness. With these goals in mind, ocean-based industries are adopting new sustainable production models, similar to biorefineries, which are effective for waste valorization, namely, converting low-value biomass into commercially relevant by-products. Based on a deeper knowledge of aquatic feedstocks, the development and implementation of a marine biorefinery can be fundamental to consolidate a "greener"socioeconomic development, similar to that observed in green chemistry. However, biorefineries are sophisticated multi-step systems with numerous feedstocks and commodities. Therefore, their implementation requires expertise in all stages of manufacturing, in addition to a clear vision of all raw materials, residues, and products. In this sense, with this perspective, we provide an initial overview of the current state-of-the-art on marine biorefineries and the sources and applications of their by-products. Afterward, we suggest how to integrate green chemistry and blue economy principles into ocean-based industries, aiming to support a more sustainable, profitable, and conscious ocean economy.

In the same year, 14 state leaders who were members of The Ocean Panel, including Indonesia, agreed to encourage transformation towards sustainable ocean economic development. This step was made concrete with the launch of the document "Transformations for a Sustainable Ocean Economy: A Vision for Protection, Production and Prosperity". This article aims to normatively analyze the politics of law in the enactment of the Omnibus Law, and its impact on the fulfillment of sustainable fisheries resources in Indonesia. The findings indicate a massive threat of exploitation in the marine and fisheries sector after the enactment of this Law. It is counterproductive to the government's commitment to encouraging the transformation towards sustainable ocean economic development. The government must evaluate various norms in the Omnibus Law related to the marine and fisheries sectors which are then adjusted to the commitment to sustainable ocean economic development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Marine spatial planning that addresses ocean climate-driven change (‘climate-smart MSP’) is a global aspiration to support economic growth, food security and ecosystem sustainability. Ocean climate change (‘CC’) modelling may become a key decision-support tool for MSP, but traditional modelling analysis and communication challenges prevent their broad uptake. We employed MSP-specific ocean climate modelling analyses to inform a real-life MSP process; addressing how nature conservation and fisheries could be adapted to CC. We found that the currently planned distribution of these activities may become unsustainable during the policy's implementation due to CC, leading to a shortfall in its sustainability and blue growth targets. Significant, climate-driven ecosystem-level shifts in ocean components underpinning designated sites and fishing activity were estimated, reflecting different magnitudes of shifts in benthic versus pelagic, and inshore versus offshore habitats. Supporting adaptation, we then identified: CC refugia (areas where the ecosystem remains within the boundaries of its present state); CC hotspots (where climate drives the ecosystem towards a new state, inconsistent with each sectors’ present use distribution); and for the first time, identified bright spots (areas where oceanographic processes drive range expansion opportunities that may support sustainable growth in the medium term). We thus create the means to: identify where sector-relevant ecosystem change is attributable to CC; incorporate resilient delivery of conservation and sustainable ecosystem management aims into MSP; and to harness opportunities for blue growth where they exist. Capturing CC bright spots alongside refugia within protected areas may present important opportunities to meet sustainability targets while helping support the fishing sector in a changing climate. By capitalizing on the natural distribution of climate resilience within ocean ecosystems, such climate-adaptive spatial management strategies could be seen as nature-based solutions to limit the impact of CC on ocean ecosystems and dependent blue economy sectors, paving the way for climate-smart MSP. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {As the technology of hydrokinetic tidal energy conversion looks to exploit smaller markets in the wider ‘blue economy’, innovation is still required to ensure cost competitiveness with other energy sources. A typical assumption of existing techno-economic models of tidal energy converter (TEC) arrays is that TECs positioned to minimise negative hydrodynamic interactions will maximise economic return. That the number of TECs within an array should be chosen to maximise the annual energy production, follows from this assumption. To examine the validity of these assertions for small, area-constrained arrays, a hypothetical model of the relationship of levelised cost of energy (LCOE) to the mean mechanical annual energy production (MMAEP) is developed. The model exhibits three classes of behaviour, determined by the rate of energy lost to interactions as TECs are added to an optimally positioned array; significantly, only one class has greatest MMAEP corresponding to lowest LCOE. To test this model, a contemporary optimisation algorithm is added to the advanced ocean energy techno-economic simulation tool ‘DTOcean’ and applied to arrays of TECs constrained by a 2ha deployment area. It is shown that the hypothetical LCOE model accurately describes the DTOcean results up to and including 12 TECs deployed. At 13 TECs deployed, the level of TEC interaction increases dramatically, invalidating the hypothetical model. Notably, however, the LCOE is shown to reduce significantly by allowing negative interactions between TECs, reducing by 47.8% from the best non-interacting array. Thus, subject to an improved understanding of the relationship between the environment, TEC reliability and costs, the results indicate that allowing negative interactions between TECs may increase the economically extractable resource of small area-constrained tidal energy sites. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Renewable energy, sustainable seafood, and a healthy marine ecosystem are integral elements of a sustainable blue economy. The rapid global advancement of offshore wind coupled with its potential to affect marine life compels an urgent need for robust methodologies to assess the impacts of this industry on fisheries resource species. Basic Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) and Control-Impact (CI) designs are the most common experimental designs used to study the effects of offshore wind development on fisheries resources. These designs do not account for spatial heterogeneity which presents a challenge because empirical evidence shows that impact gradients occur at wind farms, with larger effect sizes close to turbine foundations that attenuate with increasing distance. Combining the before-after sampling design with distance-based methods could provide a powerful approach for characterizing both the spatial and temporal variance associated with wind development. Toward enhancing future monitoring designs for fisheries resource species at offshore wind farms, this paper aims to: (1) examine distance-based sampling methods that have been or could potentially be used to study impacts on fisheries resources at offshore wind farms including distance-stratified BACI, distance-stratified CI, Before-After-Gradient (BAG), and After-Gradient (AG) methods; (2) synthesize the methods and findings of studies conducted to date that have used distance-based methods to examine ecological impacts of offshore wind development for benthic macroinvertebrates, finfish, birds, and small mammals; (3) examine some of the central methodological elements and issues to consider in developing distance-based impact studies; and (4) offer recommendations for how to incorporate distance-based sampling methods into monitoring plans at offshore wind farms. © Copyright © 2021 Methratta.},

	abstract = {The east coast of Africa is renowned as an adventure tourism getaway destination, and scuba dive tourists from around the world frequent the region to dive on its pristine coral reefs. Environmental change, however, is becoming a key driver for dive tourists’ decisions to travel, and these tourists are avoiding areas where coral reefs are no longer pristine. Indirect environmental risks, occurring outside the borders of countries and outside the control of dive operators, impact coral reef tourism within those countries and on the greater Blue Economy. Indirect environmental risks include climate change, industrialisation of coastal regions, increased shipping and boating activities, as well as marine and land-based pollution. This paper reports on the perceptions of dive operators on the indirect environmental risks which threaten the future of the dive tourism industry in the East African Marine Ecoregion. The research followed an exploratory and descriptive research design within a post-positivism paradigm. Via purposive sampling, surveys were conducted with 34 dive operators from Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa. Research findings indicate two overall areas of concern impacting coral reefs—activities relating to climate change, followed by coastal development and industrialisation of coastal areas. In terms of specific indirect risks, marine pollution is significant, followed by coral bleaching and extreme weather events. There is an increasing level of concern that continued environmental disturbances will impact business in future. This is not just a problem for the coastal tourism industry but also for coastal communities who share this precious resource. It is vital to cast a spotlight on the turbulent waters of environmental risks, which ultimately affect the sustainability of marine tourism and the wider Blue Economy. By doing so, regional plans can be shaped to respond to these threats in a more discerning way. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In 2020, 3.5 billion people depended on the ocean for their source of protein. By 2050, with an estimated population of 9.7 billion, the need for healthy marine ecosystems, with species and habitat biodiversity to support global food security, was paramount. This meant aggressively protecting and rebuilding the marine species populations and habitats necessary to restore marine ecosystem structure, function, and resilience, in tandem with mitigating the impacts of climate change and providing a sustainable means for coastal communities dependent on the ocean for their livelihoods. The partnering lessons learned over many decades and their associated impact on the national policies of many nations led to an increased number of collaborations across the globe, including initiatives from the United Nations in the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The Blue Economy is a catch all term that is used to describe a wide variety of development approaches and priorities in the ocean and coastal areas. A number of distinct, and sometimes conflicting discourses have emerged in relation to the Blue Economy, which are distinguished by the degree to which they prioritize different development objectives. This paper explores the range of Blue Economy interpretations, governance strategies and implementation approaches that exist across Commonwealth countries. Key Blue Economy policy statements and governance instruments are analysed in order to ascertain the way the Blue Economy is being institutionalized at a national level, with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals and the Commonwealth Blue Charter. High-level Blue Economy objectives appear to prioritize economic and environmental objectives, with limited engagement with equity objectives including food security and gender equality. Blue Economy objectives are primarily being institutionalized through a diverse array of strategies, plans and policies with limited information on mechanisms for implementation. Finally, there are signs that the Blue Economy may be facilitating a greater degree of integration across sectoral management, with the emergence of range of boundary-crossing arrangements in a number of the countries examined.

	abstract = {European Union (EU) policy encourages the development of a blue economy (BE) by un-locking the full economic potential of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and other water resources, especially in member countries in which it represents a low contribution to the national economy (under 1%). However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geo-graphic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta–Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost‐efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water‐dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Brăila, Galați, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the ʺDanube Delta” Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already‐existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galați county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galați compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost‐demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This work is the result of an international research effort to determine the main impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine recreational fishing. Changes were assessed on (1) access to fishing, derived from lockdowns and other mobility restrictions; (2) ecosystems, because of alterations in fishing intensity and human presence; (3) the blue economy, derived from alterations in the investments and expenses of the fishers; and (4) society, in relation to variations in fishers’ health and well-being. For this, a consultation with experts from 16 countries was carried out, as well as an international online survey aimed at recreational fishers, that included specific questions designed to capture fishers’ heterogeneity in relation to behavior, skills and know-how, and vital involvement. Fishers’ participation in the online survey (5,998 recreational fishers in 15 countries) was promoted through a marketing campaign. The sensitivity of the fishers’ clustering procedure, based on the captured heterogeneity, was evaluated by SIMPER analysis and by generalized linear models. Results from the expert consultation highlighted a worldwide reduction in marine recreational fishing activity. Lower human-driven pressures are expected to generate some benefits for marine ecosystems. However, experts also identified high negative impacts on the blue economy, as well as on fisher health and well-being because of the loss of recreational fishing opportunities. Most (98%) of the fishers who participated in the online survey were identified as advanced, showing a much higher degree of commitment to recreational fishing than basic fishers (2%). Advanced fishers were, in general, more pessimistic about the impacts of COVID-19, reporting higher reductions in physical activity and fish consumption, as well as poorer quality of night rest, foul mood, and raised more concerns about their health status. Controlled and safe access to marine recreational fisheries during pandemics would provide benefits to the health and well-being of people and reduce negative socioeconomic impacts, especially for vulnerable social groups.

	abstract = {As large ocean states with aspirations for sustainable development, it comes as little surprise that Pacific Island nations have found appeal in the concept of the blue economy. This paper attempts to map the construction and mobilization of the blue economy concept in the Pacific Islands over the last ten years through case studies of three regional bodies: the Pacific Small Island Developing States grouping (PSIDS), the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF), and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Rather than working to uncover some central definition or understanding of a Pacific blue economy, this paper frames the concept as a political tool that is mobilized by specific agents in response to specific challenges and in pursuit of specific goals. It is suggested that the blue economy has been engaged as an instrument of political maneuver by Pacific regional bodies, with these agents leveraging the concept across both regional and international platforms to advance their political and diplomatic interests. However, emerging observations also indicate a potential disconnect between the political effectiveness of this concept and its material reality, namely its ability to advance sustainable ocean development outcomes on the ground to the benefit of Pacific communities and ecosystems. Therefore, while the blue economy may present an attractive political tool for Pacific Islands agents, this paper suggests that greater scrutiny is required into the concept's material value and virtue. © 2021},

	abstract = {The fundamentals of the blue economy promoting sustainable development by minimizing the consumption of fresh water, organic pollution and chemical contamination. On the other hand, the six sigma tool enables companies to improve the performance of their processes by reducing waste and statistical techniques. Not many works have been identified that related these two approaches, therefore, the objective of this work is to apply the six sigma tool with the blue economy fundamentals to assess the economic and environmental performance in the aircraft refueling process. The methods used were Return of Investment (ROI) and Mass Intensity Factor (MIF). A multiple case study was carried out involving two largest Brazilian airlines and the fuel distributor. The main results show the reduction of flight delays and, consequently, a decrease in the diesel consumption by trucks and energy generators, and water. The calculated economic gains were 52.9 million dollars annually and the environmental gains were the non-generation of 150 thousand tons annually. This work contributed to the theory for being the first to link SS in Aviation with measuring environmental benefits, even more so through the Blue Economy and to the practice for presenting to managers the possibility of obtaining economic and environmental benefits in the aircraft refueling process with no investment. © 2021},

	abstract = {The conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources has been declared by the United Nations as one of 17 priority Sustainable Development Goals. At present, most of the maritime states are striving to improve the efficiency of their use of marine resources, including sea space. In particular, the European Union is implementing a number of projects related to the implementation of marine spatial planning (MSP) tools. The Baltic Sea is considered as a pilot region, where a pan-Baltic coordinated MSP plan has been developed to provide for sustainable development and blue growth in the marine and coastal economy. The Russian Federation is one of the Baltic countries, but the MSP procedure at the state level does not have institutional and regulatory support, which requires the elimination of gaps and additional development of the maritime management system. The laws of the organization and development of the general theory of management are used in this study. An Integrated Management Model for sustainable marine and coastal use is proposed as a tool for ensuring blue growth, including four interrelated elements (specific management functions), namely “Integrated Coastal Zone Management”, “Marine Spatial Planning”, “Management of Marine Macroregion” and “Ocean Governance”. Their functional content and interaction mechanisms are discussed in order to implement an integral approach to marine use. The vertical structure of the proposed integral model includes three levels corresponding to the federal and regional levels of government and the level of municipal self-governance. The use of the integral model should help accelerate the process of introducing and using MSP instruments in the process of strategic planning in the socio-economic development of the Russian coastal territories. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Historically, energy constraints have limited the spatial range, endurance and capabilities of ocean observation systems. Recently developed wave energy conversion technologies have the potential to help overcome these limitations by providing co-located and persistent power generation for ocean observations, enabling new opportunities for ocean research. In this paper, we develop the first techno-economic model for wave-powered ocean observation systems and use the model to study system characteristics and cost drivers. Our model utilizes time-domain simulation and optimization to identify cost-optimal system characteristics and to estimate capital and operational costs. Using our model, we evaluate the use of wave energy to power a 200 W ocean observation system deployed for five years at five unique geographic locations. We found that, depending on the geographic location, cost-optimal wave energy powered systems require an ≈ 0.5–3 kW wave energy converter and an ≈ 15-50 kWh battery. The corresponding range of power system costs over the deployment duration is between $110,800 and $673,200. We build on these results by performing a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters and identifying the potential economic impact of future technology advancements. Overall, our results indicate that characteristics of the geographic location, power system durability, and electrical power demand are key drivers of power system economics for ocean observing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Blue Economy, a concept broadly describing a sustainable use of the oceans, is increasingly invoked by a variety of stakeholders in the maritime domain. As there is no unambiguous definition of the Blue Economy, this chapter investigates different understandings of the Blue Economy concept and shows how the maritime security and the Blue Economy agendas are co-dependent. By introducing Blue Economy strategies of selected states and organisations, and scrutinising the way they relate to the maritime security agenda, the importance of the Blue Economy for maritime security governance is discussed. As maritime security and the Blue Economy mutually enable each other, an integrated perspective is necessary to realise the potential of the Blue Economy for securing the maritime domain. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Ruxandra-Laura Bosilca, Susana Ferreira and Barry J.
