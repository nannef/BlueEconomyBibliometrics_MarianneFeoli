	abstract = {The marine biopharmaceutical industry (MBI) has been considered as an important part of the blue economy. The high-quality development of this industry depends on the high-level coordinated development of technological innovation system (TIS). In the present study, the coupling mechanism of industrial innovation input subsystem and innovation output subsystem was analyzed for the first time. On this basis, the development level and coupling coordination level of TIS in China’s MBI during 2008–2018 were empirically evaluated with the capacity coupling coordination model. Then, the obstacle factors were diagnosed and recognized with the obstacle model. The results showed that the innovation input index fluctuated at a low level in China’s MBI. The innovation output index has basically maintained a growth trend, whereas the quality of development was not high. Although the coupling coordination level of TIS showed a positive change as mild disordered → primary coordinated → well-coordinated, the development type of innovation system has changed from the lagging output of innovation into the lagging input of innovation. Insufficient input of innovation factors remained the main obstacle to the improvement of coordination level. Based on the above analysis, suggestions were put forward from the perspectives of policy and fund guarantees to improve the coupling coordination level in China’s MBI. © 2023, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

	abstract = {Emerging science and technologies and their use in various fields are immense. Carbon-containing compounds are precious on earth as blue carbon. A blue economy is emerging owing to the huge demand for material synthesis and its applications in various fields such as food, medicine, technology, and the product development sectors. Using sustainable ocean resources to benefit human needs through economic development is termed “blue economy.” Blue carbon, which is derived from the ocean’s resources, embraces socioeconomic development, which is known as blue economy. Blue carbon refers to organic carbon derived from ocean's flora, such as seagrass, seaweed, mangroves, and marshes. Marine resources generated through carbon capture and sequestration help to boost the economy. In this chapter, the blue economy and blue carbon based on marine algae are discussed and explored. Marine algae (seaweed) are macroscopic and adapted to different conditions in the marine environment. Based on carbon sequestration and the accumulation of multiple products, seaweed is considered as a blue carbon generator for the development of the blue economy. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Global energy strategy has quickly shifted to a new paradigm. Countries understand the importance of a near-zero carbon energy mix and the need to reduce their energy imports and become energy independent. One immediate solution is the re-enforcement of renewable energy infrastructures such as wind, solar and hydro generation. However, certain sectors, particularly the Blue Economy, may need a different solution. The oscillating-water-column (OWC) wave energy converter is a proven concept, many prototypes of which are already being deployed on the open sea, and can help bridge this gap. Energy harvesting from this system will be improved if more efficient (and reliable) power take-off (PTO) systems and control algorithms are used. A novel control algorithm for a turbine–generator set was developed based on the physical interactions between the PTO and the OWC system. The results were compared with experimental data from real operation at sea. The algorithm does not need to predict the sea state conditions in order to maximise power generation. Additionally, it protects the PTO in extremely energetic sea states and minimises overspeeding and the use of a safety valve. Comparing the operating results of the 30 kW biradial turbine–generator set at the Mutriku wave power plant with the corresponding numerical results provided by the novel control algorithm showed a 6% increase in annual electricity production. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the framework of a sustainable marine bioeconomy, the present work describes an advanced, eco-friendly, fully integrated biorefinery process for marine Ulva fasciata macroalgae. That would serve as a solution for ecosystem bioremediation, an effective utilization of marine macroalgal resources, and a new initiative to promote a green and low-carbon economy. Ulva fasciata biomass can be utilized as an organic fertilizer with total N, P2O5, and K2O contents of 3.17% and a C/N ratio of 11.71. It can also be used as a solid biofuel with a sufficient calorific value of 15.19 MJ/kg. It has high carbohydrate content and low lignin content of approximately 44.85% and 1.5%, respectively, which recommend its applicability in bioethanol and biobutanol production. Its protein, fiber, lipid, and ash contents of approximately 13.13%, 9.9%, 3.27%, and 21%, respectively with relatively high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and omega-9 fatty acids (n-9 MUFAs) and relatively low omega-6 fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) and a n-6/n-3 ratio of 0.13 also recommend its applicability as food additives and animal feeders. Moreover, the suggested sequential zero-waste biomass residue process yielded 34.89% mineral-rich water extract (MRWE), 2.61% chlorophylla,b, 0.41% carotenoids, 12.55% starch, 3.27% lipids, 22.24% ulvan, 13.37% proteins, and 10.66% cellulose of Ulva fasciata dry weight. The efficient biocidal activity of extracted ulvan against pathogenic microorganisms and sulfate-reducing bacteria recommends its application for medical purposes, water densification, and mitigation of microbially induced corrosion in the oil and gas industry. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The blue bond market has emerged as one of the latest additions in the sustainable debt market. Its goal is to channel funding toward sustainable blue economy projects related to the ocean and freshwater. While the protection of hydric resources has gained importance within the problem of climate change, Sustainable Development Goals linked to water remain the most underfunded. Since the issuance of the first blue bond in the Seychelles in 2018, multiple public and private organizations have turned to the blue bond market to raise funds. However, unlike the green bond market, no comprehensive market overview exists, preventing stakeholders from judging whether this label has been effective in protecting water resources and drawing conclusions on its future potential. This paper draws on an extensive review of academic research and complements it with a unique and comprehensive analysis of blue bonds issued to date, providing a contribution to the literature on sustainable finance. Between 2018 and 2022, 26 blue bond transactions took place, amounting to a total value of USD 5.0 billion, with a 92% CAGR between those years. Currently, blue bonds represent less than 0.5% of the sustainable debt market. The use of proceeds has mostly focused on waste management, biodiversity, and sustainable fisheries, but also ranges across other areas of the sustainable blue economy. Only two-thirds of blue bond issuers report on impact metrics, providing further opportunity to add detail and rigor. We draw comparisons to the more mature green bond market and conclude that a lack of standardized definitions, metrics, and expertise by issuers and investors are significant barriers to the blue bond market. Resolving these barriers is crucial to attract corporations and ensure continued growth of the blue bond market. © 2023 by the authors.},

While particular attention needs to be paid to the potential risks posed by the perspective of economic gains resulting from marine exploitation, a large public support is also required to build a sustainable society. The mass media plays a critical role in communicating scientific advances and risks, shaping opinions, and fostering behavioural change. The article discusses the media coverage of the blue economy in British newspapers through a frame analysis. The analysis reveals that the blue economy is largely framed in terms of economic opportunities and weak sustainability, and treated in a very factual, non-critical way. Sea blindness enables us to understand the lack of in-depth discussion about the blue economy and its framing as an overtly positive economic opportunity. The findings also suggest that the way the blue economy is represented proceeds from the dominant development discourse that has spread onto the marine space.

	abstract = {A sustainable coastal “blue economy” is one of the most significant opportunities and challenges in the new era. However, the management and conservation of marine ecosystems must recognize the interdependence in the coupled human and natural systems. In this study, we employed satellite remote sensing to map the spatial and temporal distribution of Secchi disk depth (SDD) in Hainan coastal waters, China for the first time, and quantitatively revealed the impacts of environmental investments on the coastal water environment in the context of global climate change. Based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in situ concurrent matchups (N = 123), a simple green band (555 nm)-based quadratic algorithm was first developed to estimate the SDD for the coastal waters of Hainan Island in China (R2 = 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.74 m). The long time-series SDD dataset (2001–2021) for Hainan coastal waters was reconstructed from MODIS observations. Spatially, SDD showed a pattern of high water clarity in eastern and southern coastal waters and low water clarity in the western and northern coastal areas. This pattern is attributed to unbalanced distributions of bathymetry and pollution from seagoing rivers. Seasonally, the humid tropical monsoon climate drove the SDD into a general pattern of high in the wet season and low in the dry season. Annually, the SDD in Hainan coastal waters improved significantly (p < 0.1), benefiting from environmental investments over the last 20 years. However, the increasing global oceanic wind speed in recent years has exacerbated sediment resuspension and deep ocean mixing, counteracting approximately 14.14% of the remedial management's effectiveness in protecting and restoring the coastal ecosystem.

	abstract = {While the ocean space has long been ignored by social sciences, the past 15 years have witnessed an increased interest in the marine environment by scholars in Human Geography. The academic literature on the blue economy, almost non-existent a few years ago, is now burgeoning. The academic debate has offered some critical assessment of blue economy initiatives, but more needs to be done to address the true place of environmental protection within a blue economy, and to put people at the centre of concerns and analyses. Of particular concern, is the ambiguity of the blue economy concept and the confusion over its social and environmental sustainability, which can ultimately result in harmful practices. An important question is then how should social scientists in general and geographers, specifically, engage with these debates, and in particular how should the potential human and social costs of the blue economy be investigated and addressed while assuring justice and fairness? The papers presented here share the vision that environmental sustainability, justice and equality should be at the heart of the blue economy; not just conceptually, but practically too. The papers pursue efforts to identify blue economy risks and the mechanisms through which they occur; assess the place of inclusion and participation in a sustainable blue economy; define what blue economy policies should include to drive just and sustainable practices; and identify where the dominant understandings of the blue economy and its priorities are coming from. In other words, they put considerations of justice and broader cultural structures at the centre of their concerns and analysis. They also highlight the need to bypass geographical boundaries and gain insights from other disciplines and methodologies to grasp such an encompassing concept, and foster not just a blue economy with social justice, but a blue economy for social justice.

We examined their accountability and disclosure practices on sustainable development goals (SDGs) using the drivers, pressures, state, welfare, and response accounting framework. Based on their 2019 sustainability reports, just 7% of the companies assessed disclosed on SDG14. However, 51% of these companies can be considered as aware, albeit to varying degrees, of the pressures their industries place on the oceans, 44% deploy mitigating activities, and 26% are aware and actively lead business responses to ocean challenges. Although we have seen just early responses in addressing ocean challenges, companies’ awareness and activation must converge to achieve ocean sustainability and move businesses into a truly blue economy. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {For more than a billion years, seaweeds have been a segment of marine primary productivity this fact must be contemplated while considering emerging conceptual frameworks such as the “blue economy”. This sector not only has the potential to provide renewable feedstock but its cultivation and processing ticks an important box for sustainable development. Seaweed cultivation in India is gaining momentum and great attention is being given to developing the infrastructure. A flagship program ‘Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)’ has provided adequate budgetary allocation to achieve a production of 11.2 Mt (fresh) feedstock. However, the scheme seems to focus only on material benefits (product development) and the ecosystem services, especially regulatory services have seldom been taken into consideration. Thus, the present article tries to address the estimation of potential regulatory ecosystem services [capture carbon, uptake nutrients and heavy metals (Cr, Co, Cd)] met through Kappaphycus alvarezii farming, at the Pan-India level. The estimates were made for both tube net and raft cultivation methods separately. The farm cover was estimated to be around 700,000 ha supporting approximately 780,000 farmers for tube net, while it was 56,000 ha supporting ~ 1.25 million farmers for raft cultivation. A total number of tube nets that would be put to use would be 140 million and 56 million in the case of rafts. Once the target is achieved India would have gained the ability to annually capture approximately 600,000 t of carbon, 22,000 t of nitrogen, and 2000 t of phosphorous and absorb more than 1000 t of heavy metals cumulatively. Nevertheless, a monetary valuation of ecosystem services is needed to arrive at rational decisions by policy-makers and resource managers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The ability to quantify nature's value for tourism has significant implications for natural resource management and sustainable development policy. This is especially true in the Eastern Caribbean, where many countries are embracing the concept of the Blue Economy. The utilization of user-generated content (UGC) to understand tourist activities and preferences, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, remains at the early stages of development and application. This work describes a new effort which has modelled and mapped multiple nature dependent sectors of the tourism industry across five small island nations. It makes broad use of UGC, while acknowledging the challenges and strengthening the approach with substantive input, correction, and modification from local experts. Our approach to measuring the nature-dependency of tourism is practical and scalable, producing data, maps and statistics of sufficient detail and veracity to support sustainable resource management, marine spatial planning, and the wider promotion of the Blue Economy framework. © 2023},

Oceans supply food, energy, mineral resources and are storehouses of bio-diversity; they influence weather and climate and provide an ecosystem for sustaining human life and other biota. Oceans are the major source of fossil-fuel-based energy and influence the economy of the world and thus also are of strategic importance. It is imperative that future growth and prosperity will be dependent on oceans in view of the im-pacts of climate change on sustainability. For the same rea-son, the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, stressed expanding the green economy to a blue eco-nomy. The conservation and sustainable utilization of the oceans, seas and marine resources have been identified as one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Con-sidering the importance of ocean development, UNESCO/ International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) has decla-red the current decade as the ‘Decade of Ocean Science’ to deliver the science needed to achieve SDG-14, ‘Life under Water’. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recognized the vital role of the ocean-dependent economy for future deve-lopment and very aptly articulated the importance of the blue economy as follows: ‘To me, the blue chakra or wheel in India’s flag represents the potential of the blue revolution, or the ocean economy’. As oceans are going to play a stellar role in global development, it is vital that G20 under India’s Presidency gives sufficient importance to develop the blue economy for global good. © 2023, Current Science.

	abstract = {Marine plastic waste is one of the most difficult global ocean governance issues at present, and is also the focus of marine waste governance in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea region surrounded by China, Japan, and Republic of Korea (ROK). China, Japan, and Republic of Korea (ROK)are now aware of the importance of this issue to their surrounding waters and their country’s development. However,the poor implementation of marine governance gives rise to the unsatisfactory effect of marine plastic waste governance in the sea area. Based on the concept of blue economy and the data of plastic pollution in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, this paper discusses the feasibility of establishing binding legal norms and policies to promote the progress of marine plastic waste treatment in China, Japan and Republic of Korea. By using research methods of text analysis and status survey, this paper analyzes the differences and common demands of China, Japan and Republic of Korea for marine plastic pollution control. It is concluded that three countries have common demands in the management of the whole life cycle of marine plastic pollution, the establishment of flexible legal instruments, and the participation of stakeholders. Finally, through the case experience of the blue cycle model of marine plastic waste in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China, this paper proposes that this model can also be used in the management of marine plastic waste in China, Japan and Republic of Korea. Three countries can gradually promote the cooperation of marine plastic waste laws and regulations by starting with the treatment of\ fishery plastic waste, and innovate the blue cycle model, so as to finally promote the conclusion of the regional marine waste treatment agreement.

Coastal margins will be shrinking as sea levels rise due to climate change, squeezing already scarce port resources, exacerbating competition for these spaces, and generating conflicts. This paper focuses on the competition for waterfront space on the Thames River of Connecticut bordered by the municipalities of New London, Groton, Norwich, Ledyard, and Montville. Emerging wind power in the new Blue Economy looks to reshape port usage in the Thames River. The recent focus on wind generation by the State of Connecticut, coupled with several competitive bidding events for wind-generated electricity, has augmented demand for port space that will serve as a staging area for this offshore development. Although the development of wind power will occur offshore, Connecticut ports are anticipating port use by wind companies with winning bids. This paper explores the processes by which port space has been (re)allocated and contested, and examines the nature of the ensuing conflicts and outcomes.

	abstract = {The Blue Economy (BE) has captured the attention of diverse interests to the ocean and there is rising concern about making it more equitable and inclusive. As it currently stands, diversity, social equity, and inclusion considerations have not been foregrounded in the discourse surrounding the BE and are continuously overlooked and undervalued. This paper reviews the ongoing social inequalities in the BE and distribution of benefits and costs across different groups in society. It also explores why equity matters, and how it can be achieved. Mirroring the call for under-represented or marginalized social groups to receive a fair share of the returns, which may be more than they have received to date. Our analysis shows that between 1988 and 2017, a Germany–based company has registered about 39% of all known marine genetic resources, while three companies in Asia control 30% of the market share of seafood sector in 2018. These findings show high consolidation of the ocean space by top corporations. Therefore, this paper argues that the exclusion of equity considerations within the BE investments can undermine ocean-based activities such as marine wildlife conservation initiatives that may disrupt the ocean sustainability agenda.

Research related to smart island destinations is still limited, let alone those that utilize blockchain technology to create the smartness of the destination. This research is an empirical study that captures the perceptions of stakeholders in the blue economy on smart islands and the use of blockchain technology in order to build smart islands, a destination that consists of many islands that lack connectedness, such as the Seribu Islands in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data were collected using qualitative and quantitative approaches (mixed methods). Qualitative data were collected from scientific journal publications and followed up with VOS viewer analysis, and quantitative data with the questionnaire survey responses from 150 blue economy industry players in the Seribu Islands and structural equation modeling showed that good digital literacy and blue economy management have significant influence on blockchain technology and impact smart islands. This study indicates that, for islands that have challenges in accessibility and connectivity, the presence of blockchain and smart technology is needed to integrate various resources from each stakeholder so that the blue economy in the islands can be developed more effectively and efficiently, while at the same time ensuring the achievement of sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.

Even though there is a policy in the form of assistance from the government in the form of subsidies, fishermen still feel doubtful about being able to get such assistance. To overcome this and with the potential of solar energy in Indonesia, as well as a manifestation of appropriate technology and blue economy policies, a photovoltaic system is made that is combined with underwater lights as a fishing tool. Activities are carried out by measuring environmental conditions and the energy that comes out of the PV system and giving questionnaires to the fishermen. The results showed that the use of PV systems combined with underwater lights in fishing activities gave good results. The result of electrical energy that can be generated is 393.24 Wh/day and can meet the ship's electricity needs for 4 days.

	abstract = {Current framing of the blue economy is problematic and deficient in a number of key aspects, specifically in terms of how resilience and justice are currently understood and applied in blue economy discourse. A more holistic and comprehensive understanding and framing of what a sustainable blue economy is, is required to avoid perpetuation of the ecological and social problems of conventional economic growth. New understandings of blue economy which place justice, resilience, and sustainability centrally are required if the blue economy concept is to retain credibility in the context of ongoing climate disruptions, socio-economic challenges, and the progressive degradation of coastal ecosystems. The blue economy needs to represent a practical, real-world solution to these issues for coastal communities striving for sustainability. While ideas of ‘just transition’ have been afforded considerable attention in the literature, here the argument is forwarded for a ‘just disruptions’ approach, underpinned by presentation of a novel framework. The ‘just disruptions’ framework posits that rights-based and capabilities-based approaches to justice, including principles of distributive and procedural justice, be applied to inform adaptive and resilience focused responses in coastal zones. Applying these principles in practice, the realities of space, place, scale, and power relations need to be acknowledged and more deliberately considered. Such a framing is urgently required to firmly ground debates on blue growth and blue economy in the imperatives of resilience, and social and ecological sustainability. © 2021 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).},

	abstract = {Marine plastic waste pollution damages the stability of the marine ecosystem and inhibits the sustainable development of the "blue economy", which has aroused widespread concern worldwide. Nowadays, cooperation on marine plastic waste management is an urgent research topic. A global consensus on management cooperation is emerging, but the economic feasibility of cooperation has not yet to be proven. This paper takes the amount of capital investment, technology level of governance and the amount of marine plastic waste to be treated as variables affecting the cooperative income to construct a cooperative network game model for marine plastic waste management from the perspective of economics. The paper distributes benefits based on the "Myerson value", analyzes the equilibrium conditions of the model and tests the stability of cooperation. In addition, numerical analysis is carried out using actual data from key countries to demonstrate the practical economic feasibility of cooperation in marine plastic waste management. The findings include: (1) The technology level of governance and the amount of marine plastic waste to be treated have a negative impact on the country's choice of cooperative governance strategies and the stability of cooperative alliance, while the amount of capital investment is conductive to it. (2) The size of the alliance has an impact on country's strategic choices and the stability of the alliances. Too small an alliance is not conducive to cooperative alliance building, which gradually becomes more likely as the size of the alliance increases, but it is uncertain the effect of oversized alliance and what size is most appropriate. (3) Cooperation in marine plastic waste management is economically feasible at both the theoretical and practical levels. (4) Encouraging technological innovation to improve the governance level, implementing extended producer responsibility measures to shift the management cost, exerting the positive influence of key countries to promote the stability of the alliance, and establishing a reasonable interest adjustment mechanism to coordinate the interests of all parties are helpful to build a stable and efficient cooperation alliance and improve the economic feasibility of marine plastic waste management cooperation. This paper not only provides theoretical support for the global cooperation of marine plastic waste management, but also proves the feasibility of practice and points out the direction for its practice. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution presents a major challenge facing stakeholders and decision-making worldwide. Plastics in the ocean damage biodiversity and marine ecosystem services that the blue economy relies upon. The present work analyses and reviews the literature on plastic pollution and the background knowledge about marine plastic pollution in Morocco. The economy of Morocco depends mainly on marine activities, including fisheries, tourism, and maritime trade. These sectors were identified as the main in-situ sources of plastics entering Moroccan coastal waters. The analysis results showed that the increasing abundance of plastics in such marine systems causes substantial economic loss to blue economy activities. In contrast, the lack of data on the plastic waste quantity entering Moroccan water is a limiting factor for assessing plastic pollution. This highlights the need for a risk assessment and more field investigations to value the weight impacts of marine activities generators of plastics on biodiversity and the economy. In addition, implementing laws and rules forbidding the disposal of plastic waste (PW) in public spaces, mainly beaches, and streets, is urgently needed. Raising awareness of plastic waste management and prioritizing improved waste collection, sorting, and management would boost Morocco’s establishment and adoption of circular economy strategies. It is worth noting that while implementing the management projects and regulatory frameworks of plastic waste, considering their source and usage purpose is mandatory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Based on in-depth anthropological field research in rural Japan, this paper analyses the ongoing reform of Japanese fishery governance and its social and environmental justice implications, as globally proliferating discourses on the ‘blue economy’ and ‘blue growth’ are driving the enclosure of one of the last vestiges of natural resource commons in small-scale fisheries. Coastal fisheries in Japan are often idealized as one of the last bastions of resource co-management in an industrialized country, with local cooperatives collectively controlling territorial fishing rights. However, demographic change, declining profitability, and dwindling resource stocks are challenging their viability. Reform of the fishery law, designed to stimulate new growth and industrialization – particularly in aquaculture – includes the opening up of coastal fishery resources to corporate investors, the strengthening of top-down regulation, and the introduction of individual fishing quotas (IQ). The desire to boost domestic seafood production also has to be seen within the context of the double anxiety of high dependency on international trade for foodstuff and of Japan's vanishing rurality. This emphasis on private capital and presupposed economic and scientific rationality builds on the same rationale of blue economy and blue growth discourses, which promise financial along with ecological returns on large-scale investments in sustainable ocean economies. Growth-oriented reform in Japan now imperils successful resource co-management in coastal small-scale fisheries. Its analysis therefore offers deeper insights into the transformative as well as dispossessive potential of the global paradigmatic shift towards an intensified industrial exploitation of the oceans. The question of social and environmental justice is central in the re-allocation of access rights to ocean spaces and resources and the re-arrangement of decision-making processes in fishery governance, as local fishing communities face a very real threat of dispossession and disempowerment.

	abstract = {Introduction: Blue economics research is a research field that is achieving more and more interest among international scientists. This study adds more knowledge as it aims to investigate the causal relationships between blue economic factors – living and non-living resources, ocean energy, port activities, shipbuilding and repair, maritime transport, coastal tourism, human development indicator, per capita income, fish capture, internal renewable water resources per capita, marine protected areas, greenhouse gas emissions and population density, all factors related to maritime activities – and the blue economy (BE) itself. Methods: In order to reach these objectives, some special analytical and econometric methods are used. Among them the multivariate Granger causality theory, the correlation analysis and panel data techniques are employed. This set of methods helps us to study the complex set of relationships among the various factors related to the BE and their influence on per capita income (PCI) and economic growth. The data used to conduct this research were collected from the Eurostat, the E.U. statistical database. Several European countries and the span period 2010-2018 are used too. Results: The analysis showed evidence that per capita income is associated to other factors of the blue economy, that PCI (Granger) causes coastal tourism and population density, and that there are five other factors that positively influence PCI growth, namely, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), maritime transport, nonliving resources and ports’ activities. This paper adds some new understandings to theory and calls the attention to society, in general, and the blue economics, in particular. For instance, if policymakers want to increase income per capita of these regions, they should take action on some variables such as human development indicator (HDI), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, living resources, maritime transport and ocean energy. The results reveal that blue economy is a good alternative to promote both economic growth and PCI. Discussion: The concerns that make up the blue economy, such as ocean energy, port activities, ship building and repair, maritime transport, coastal tourism, HDI, maritime fish capture, marine protected areas, and GHG reductionare good factors to stimulate economic growth. Among these, the most influencing are maritime transport, living resources and the production of ocean energy. This study adds knowledge to theory, innovates in the methods and techniques used, in the results discovered, in its discussion, and in the mixture of blue economic factors, too. As far as we know, it is one of the first papers that fills this gap in the literature regarding the more and more important blue economy.

Globally, the Indian aquaculture sector is currently the second largest in terms of aquacultural production but is moving toward different species that meet SDG and facilitate international marketing opportunities. The farming of aquacultural species with innovative technology constitutes an efficient use of resources. Productive research on feeding, disease management, construction, and layout helps overcome the challenges faced in aquaculture.

	abstract = {The modern day seascape is a mix of natural habitats (saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass, unvegetated beaches), but increasingly is being replaced with hard engineering structures (e.g. floating pontoons) that have resulted in novel habitats available for flora and fauna. While these engineered structures provide new marine habitat resources, from the viewpoint of biodiversity, they effectively support a sub-set of species found in natural habitats. Unlike previous studies that have used divers for fish visual census, we used a remotely operated vessel with an underwater camera to examine the fish community using floating pontoons in a marina facility in tropical central Queensland, Australia. The camera filmed continuously the edge and underside of pontoons (both surveys covered similar pontoon linear distances – July (winter) 430m; November (summer) 485m; 2021). Fifteen fish species representing 14 families were recorded, with more species observed during summer compared to the winter survey. Remarkably, across both surveys of the 243 fishes individuals that were recorded, 166 (68%) appeared upside-down in videos (i.e., oriented to the underside of the pontoon). Engaging a behaviour of swimming upside-down has been acknowledged in natural habitats elsewhere; some coral reef species living in caves or reef ledges orientate themselves to the cave ceiling or overhanging ledge to increase prey capture rate. However, this is the first study to record fishes exhibiting the same behaviour. We conclude that our less invasive video survey approach provided the opportunity to observe fishes in a state of natural behaviour, orientating themselves towards the pontoon substrate, which is probably simply a response of adhering to basic characteristic modes, i.e., it is the orientation relative to the substrate that is important, rather than their orientation in space per se. Indeed marina pontoons provide an additional feature in already habitat complex estuaries; these data add to why we need to consider the ecosystem services offered by marine infrastructure, and the plasticity of fish to adapt to new environments in an expanding blue economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) often favors blue growth objectives over biodiversity conservation, diminishing its role in promoting sustainability. We used in-depth qualitative document analysis to assess how conservation principles and priorities are included in five case studies to identify a path for better integrating conservation with MSP. Five themes emerged, reflecting conservation in MSP from weak to strong inclusion: (1) prioritizing economy; (2) ecosystems as limits; (3) social-ecological systems; (4) ecosystems as functional; and (5) ecosystems as fundamental. Our analysis suggests MSP priorities for managing or mitigating impacts and conservation was less apparent, though some plans appear more prepared to integrate conservation. We propose the concept of conservation ready MSP, where plans are designed to integrate conservation in MSP as a way to support sustained ocean use. MSP may be more conservation ready when specific commitments are made and conservation underpins ocean use, reflecting the fundamental role of biodiversity conservation in sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The blue economy integrates commercial, research and innovation activities across diverse industrial sectors. Achieving a sustainable blue economy requires unlocking the potential of science and innovation to develop innovative ocean sustainability solutions. This study explores the role of foresight in co-creating alternative, preferred futures for a sustainable blue economy looking towards 2030 and in establishing an interdisciplinary dialogue about research and innovation opportunities to achieve these futures. To this end, a foresight exercise is conducted with marine scientists and researchers in 6 countries in Europe. The exercise is designed in three stages: scanning, scenario-building and strategic orientation, and uses a combination of foresight methods to encourage creative thinking and exploration. The scenarios developed in the study describe alternative future worlds built on the establishment of self-sustaining communities and engaged societies; the diffusion of digitalisation and growth of blue biotechnologies; booming ecosystem services and open and collaborative research infrastructures that impact different sectors of the blue economy. A portfolio of research and innovation areas is developed that aims to inspire new research directions in four domains: (i) integrated ocean management tools; (ii) closed loop, circular polyculture systems; (iii) co-creation of innovation and transdisciplinary research; and (iv) open access and collaborative databases supporting ecosystem services. The study highlights the role of foresight in bridging across disciplinary perspectives and industry sectors. Foresight can be used to complement Decision-Support Systems and other quantitative approaches for research agenda-setting and for decision-making on policies addressing sustainability in the marine sciences. The process contributes to futures skills-building at institutional level and helps establish a futures mindset for strategic planning. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper identifies the current state and prospects for scientific cooperation in the field of the Blue Economy in the Black Sea Region. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications indexed in one of the largest international citation databases of peer-reviewed literature (Scopus) for the past 5 years. The following terms were selected: Blue Economy, Ocean Economy, Blue Growth, Ecosystem-Based Management and Marine Spatial Planning. For the detailed search query, we adopted the classification of the traditional and emerging sectors of the Ocean Economy, developed by the OECD, and integrated relevant keywords (equivalents) from the marine economy framework classification of the EU, US and China Blue Economy sectors. Findings The results show that non-regional actors (like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada) have been actively involved in the research agenda in the field of the Blue Economy, inter alia in the Black Sea Region, while the representation of the regional stakeholders (in particular, the BSEC Member States) is relatively low. The majority of the countries in the Black Sea Region are involved in the common scientific research agenda related to the Blue/Ocean Economy, including its traditional and emerging marine (ocean-based) sectors. Ecosystem-Based Management is underrepresented as a research area. The Black Sea Region significantly lacks academic-corporate collaboration in the field of the Blue Economy. Originality/value The current studies related to the development of the Blue Economy as a scientific area of research specifically in the Black Sea Region are underrepresented in the academic literature. The study allowed us to identify the countries from the Black Sea Region that are leading in terms of the research related to the Blue/Ocean Economy, as well as determine research trends for international cooperation related to the development of Blue/Ocean Economy in the Black Sea Region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Growth in offshore blue economies is predicted to accelerate as emerging food and energy production industries look to expand into these environments. Operating in novel environments for these industries inherently fosters uncertainty in outcomes generated by a complex suite of hazards, some of which are unknown prior to deployment. Faced with such uncertainty, a precautionary, flexible, and cross-disciplinary (integrated) approach is recommended to optimize the potential for hazards to be identified in a timely, comprehensive, and robust manner, and mitigated. However, relevant disciplines – such as aquaculture production, marine engineering, and marine renewable energy design, and associated interactions with society and the environment – often evolve with their siloed techniques and lexicons. Here we first provide an overview of selected discipline-specific approaches to hazard analysis as a first step in a pathway that can generate a holistic synthesis of hazards to and from multiple emerging sectors in novel environments. Despite challenges of applying these individual methods to cross-disciplinary projects for emerging industries, we then identify where disciplines share methodological approaches and where opportunities exist to develop integrated methods. With a growing focus on sustainable economic growth and optimizing the use of ocean space through multi-use, our review highlighted that the emerging offshore Blue Economy could benefit from the development of a flexible, integrated approach to identify and assess hazards in a comprehensive, robust and useful manner for successful planning, development, and operations. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {To enact a just and sustainable blue economy, one must consider all the actors involved in its shaping. This paper argues that a quintuple helix approach to stakeholder engagement – involving government, academia, the business community, and civil society – and an inclusive transdisciplinary action research (TAR) methodology are promising avenues with which to do so. Embracing critical pragmatism as a foundational framework, key ideas from three strands of research are consolidated: (1) the recent work on the geographical dimension of socio-technical sustainability transitions; (2) the literature on just sustainabilities and just transition; and (3) action research and transdisciplinary approaches to problem solving. This allows for the reimagination of a common future for the blue economy that is developed through a different kind of democratic process driven and informed by co-learning, and shared experiences. By adopting a transdisciplinary action research approach, actors from different disciplines and spheres of experience can gain a better mutual understanding and find commonality through the open door of collaboration. The theoretical argument presented in this paper is illustrated by a vignette of an ongoing TAR project at Southern Connecticut State University, which outlines the challenges and opportunities inherent to implementing a TAR approach.

	abstract = {Developing new technologies to utilize natural renewable energy resources and fluxes is critical to mitigate climate change and energy crisis. As a renewable energy resource, wave energy is more predictable and has a higher power density compared to solar and wind. However, the technology for wave energy harvesting is still relatively nascent. One of the major challenges as the sector developers is the lack of spatial–temporal representation of wave resources, or wave power generation, from a generic WEC. This paper proposes a novel Wave Net Power Assessment (WNPA) method by utilizing the theoretical Wave Energy Converter (WEC) power limits (including the radiation power limits, Budal's limit, and gross wave power), and applies it to a decade of wave conditions across the USA East Coast, West Coast and Hawaiian Islands. The WNPA method assesses the wave resource from device point of view (unlike traditional gross wave resource assessment) and is generally applicable to WECs regardless of dimension, size, and degrees of freedom (DoFs). The geospatial application of the WNPA method allowed for the analysis of wave power production potential along U.S. coastlines and provides WEC developers meaningful data to make decisions about the best spatial region to deploy certain WECs. Numerical simulations are conducted for WECs with 5 different sizes, 3 different operating modes across the West Coast, East Coast, and Hawaii over 10 years. In addition, productivity, efficiency and gross power quality comparisons are made in terms of the size and degree-of-freedom for WECs deployed at certain ocean sites (e.g., PacWave). A few of the most important findings: (1) The net wave power is dramatically smaller than the gross wave power, which indicates the new WNPA method has a more conservative assessment of the wave power potential; (2) A heaving 10 m WEC is found to have the highest (compared to other sizes and degrees of freedom) absorption efficiency on the West Coast and Hawaii; (3) For smaller 2 m surging/pitching WECs, ocean sites on the East Coast (e.g., Diamond Shoals, NC) maximize power production. (4) There are distinct trade-offs between maximizing power or minimizing power quality and dependencies exists between the location of interest, the WEC size, and the priority degree of freedom. The proposed methodology can be utilized by WEC technology and project developers to conduct apriori preliminary analysis of WEC deployment locations and device characteristics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Governance systems are complex adaptive systems where multiple components interact extensively. This is the case for governance of the blue economy, focused on sustainable development of marine resources. Here, the relevant policy and legislative arrangements are fragmented, and marine uses, activities and resources are generally managed on a sectoral basis by independent entities from multiple jurisdictions. In Australia, for example, complex arrangements have created uncertainty in relation to what, when, how, and by whom blue economy activities are possible. Network approaches to map and analyse complex systems could potentially improve our understanding and facilitate management of policy and legal complexity. Yet, there are few studies that have adopted such approaches in ocean governance. Our research demonstrates the application of an innovative approach based on network graphs and text mining to analyse a policy and legislative system associated with Australia's blue economy (i.e., policy and legal arrangements applicable to the coastal and marine areas within the seaward boundaries of the continental shelf around the State of Tasmania). Using a database of over 2000 international, federal, state policy and legislative arrangements, cross-sector analyses were undertaken to identify potential gaps and overlaps that may hinder the deployment of blue economy activities, particularly those relating to integrated seafood and energy production systems. Our graphs allowed quick and easy visualisation of policy and legislative clusters around government entities, relationships between those entities and clusters, as well as potential gaps and overlaps in the existing policy and legislative landscape. Results point to a lack of integration and a need for fit-for-purpose policy and legislation, particularly for the development of co-located blue economy activities. Our approach may be used in research of other complex governance settings to inform policymaking as well as for communication and educational purposes. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Coastal communities are on the frontlines of three accelerating global change drivers, climate change, blue growth, and the expansion of area-based conservation, leading to a “triple exposure” scenario. Despite efforts to maximize social benefits from climate, development, and conservation, externally driven processes can converge to amplify vulnerabilities and inequalities. Pre-existing social injustices increase the sensitivity of affected individuals to change and limit their capacity to adapt or benefit from the interacting impacts of triple exposure. We argue that external implementors cannot effectively and equitably achieve climate, economic, and conservation goals without prioritizing social justice and building general resilience. We therefore recommend that implementors: (1) address root causes of vulnerability, namely pre-existing social injustices; (2) use participatory systems approaches to improve understanding of local contexts and potential consequences of proposed initiatives; and (3) leverage inclusive partnerships to facilitate collaborative design and implementation. These strategies—applied together and adapted to local contexts—can support well-being, justice, and resilience within coastal communities experiencing rapid change. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The application of the hydroacoustic method in fisheries research has progressed both qualitatively and quantitatively. These developments include innovations in beams, techniques, applications, and technology computing (software). The application of the hydroacoustic method is now more widely applied in combination with other data collection methods such as fishing gear (e.g., set net, trawling, fishing, electrofishing, etc.), chemical methods, and assessment of environmental parameters such as dissolved oxygen and temperature. The current study aims to profile the scientific output of fisheries stock assessment utilizing hydroacoustic techniques to systematize existing knowledge and provide further directions for research. A total of 3364 search articles indexed on Web of Science and Scopus from 2000 to 2022 were collected using the set criteria. After careful screening for eligibility, 864 articles were analyzed using the PRISMA methodology. Key themes that emerged were hydroacoustic survey techniques (362 studies, 38%), fish characterization (197 studies, 25%), fisheries management (94 studies, 12%), population distribution (122 studies, 14%), and fish migration dynamics (81 studies, 10%). An overlay visualization of key themes shows that the key focus in recent years includes acoustic telemetry, bioacoustics, conservation, and reproduction. More innovations in the hydroacoustic method are needed, such as (1) Multi-field application, (2) Application to environmental monitoring, and (3) Simplified sampling design and analysis technique. Moreover, other applications could be further explored, such as the effect of changes in the fish ecosystem, climate change, pollution, and other disruptions, that could further aid the scientific community in contributing towards a blue economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Maritime transport is a vital sector for global trade and the world economy. Particularly for islands, there is also an important social dimension of this sector, since island communities strongly rely on it for a connection with the mainland and the transportation of goods and passengers. Furthermore, islands are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, as the rising sea level and extreme events are expected to induce severe impacts. Such hazards are anticipated to also affect the operations of the maritime transport sector by affecting either the port infrastructure or ships en route. The present study is an effort to better comprehend and assess the future risk of maritime transport disruption in six European islands and archipelagos, and it aims at supporting regional to local policy and decision-making. We employ state-of-the-art regional climate datasets and the widely used impact chain approach to identify the different components that might drive such risks. Larger islands (e.g., Corsica, Cyprus and Crete) are found to be more resilient to the impacts of climate change on maritime operations. Our findings also highlight the importance of adopting a low-emission pathway, since this will keep the risk of maritime transport disruption similar to present levels or even slightly decreased for some islands because of an enhanced adaptation capacity and advantageous demographic changes. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Recent studies revealed profound seafloor impacts and sedimentary carbon loss due to fishing and shipping, yet most other human activities in the ocean have been overlooked. Here, we present an assessment of organic carbon disturbance related to the globally-extensive subsea telecommunications cable network. Up to 2.82–11.26 Mt of organic carbon worldwide has been disturbed as a result of cable burial, in water depths of up to 2000 m. While orders of magnitude lower than that disturbed by bottom fishing, it is a non-trivial amount that is absent from global budgets. Future offshore developments that disturb the seafloor should consider the safeguarding of carbon stocks, across the full spectrum of Blue Economy industries. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aquaculture farming systems are the predominant source in coastal regions of the country. India, which accounts for 7.56% of global production, is the second-largest producer of marine foods. This industry accounts for around 1.24% of India’s Gross Value Added (GVA). Seafood (fish, prawns, etc.) continues to provide a vital source of healthy and nutritious food, revenue, and financial assistance to millions of people throughout the world, particularly in India. The sector employs around 28 million people at the primary level and over 50 million individuals along the value chain. Over the previous 3 years, the yearly average growth rate in this industry has been 7%. Seafood is one of the best alternatives for reducing hunger and nutrient shortage since it is a low-cost, high-protein source. The main difficulties in culture fisheries are low average production because of poor technological adoption, illness prevalence, and a lack of high-quality seed and affordable feed for targeted species. Better governance, aquaculture farming, seafood, policy support, and capacity building are all critical activities for the country’s blue economy ambitions. This diagnostic chapter seeks to comprehend the current level of production and product development, notably in the aquaculture industry in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Shrinkage of the fertile land-based agriculture industry gave up a new avenue for growth in Andhra Pradesh, India. Obviously, coastal zones are the state’s bountiful natural resources. The state of Andhra Pradesh has identified the marine food sector as one of the primary growth sectors of the newly established Andhra Pradesh’s socio-economic development. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs) became promising investments to meet climate change targets while bringing autonomy and development to several coastal countries. However, these developments may cause externalities, primarily affecting users dependent on maritime space and its seascapes, such as Tourism and Recreation (T&R). The marine renewable expansion, in general, is expected by some of the actors involved to affect T&R with the prospect of decreasing local welfare and the number of visitors. Nonetheless, this influence over Coastal and Maritime Tourism & Recreation is not well addressed by academic papers. Here we assess this literature gap via a semi-systematic narrative meta-synthesis (SSNMS) which expands on the methodology and results of two guiding reference studies (Scottish Government, 2008; Parsons & Firestone, 2018) to conjecture about this topic. The SSNMS promotes the evaluation studies produced between 2015 and 2019 selected through a rigorous investigation of relevant peer-reviewed keywords in Scopus and Web of Science. The analysis revealed that the studied knowledge gap persists and that OWFs can indeed impact coastal communities dependent on maritime tourism and recreational activities, despite the obligatory Environmental Impact Assessment for OWFs. However, both negative and positive impacts greatly vary with development stages and locations. Nevertheless, results still provide valuable conclusions common to generic coastal areas dealing with offshore wind farms sitting. In the few cases where authors consider T&R in their impact analysis, the results indicate a lack of public sensitivity and participation. Higher clarity and participation in the process might play a key role in generating optimistic attitudes toward OWF projects and positive synergies in between the local Blue Economy actors. In conclusion, the projected negative impacts mainly emerge as a reaction to the absence of proper integration between local T&R stakeholders and OWF developers, demonstrating that adverse effects are mitigable and preventable. Furthermore, the results indicate that a distinctive Tourism & Recreation Impact Assessment should be part of the obligatory technical assessments submitted by the OWF developers in coastal areas that rely on these activities. © 2022},

However, blue start-ups also experience financing constraints and in this research, we evaluate the factors that drive their gearing ratio. Using a comprehensive sample of firms across twenty-seven EU member states between 2013 and 2020, we find a negative link between debt ratio and climatic and ocean disruptions. We also report a positive relationship between asset tangibility and gearing, while regulations have a negative influence on the choice of debt as the preferred mode of financing. Our findings also suggest that blue startups with more private equity, have a lower variation in their capital mix. Finally, the fundamentals play a favorable role to motivate the use of debt financing. These findings have important implications for blue start-ups and the related ecosystem. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

In this paper, we report on discussions with diverse stakeholders to identify community needs and develop a set of functional requirements for the ongoing development of ocean science-specific analysis tools. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with individuals working in the Blue Economy space, revealing four central issues inhibiting the development of effective imaging analysis monitoring tools for marine science. We also identified twelve user archetypes that will engage with these services. Additionally, we held a workshop with 246 participants from 35 countries centered around FathomNet, a web-based open-source annotated image database for marine research. Findings from these discussions are being used to define the feature set and interface design of Ocean Vision AI, a suite of tools and services to advance observational capabilities of life in the ocean. © 2023 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {The blue economy has an estimated value of $1.5 trillion annually, which is predicted to double by 2030 (NOAA, 2021). As R&D funding for wave energy converters (WECs) continues to rise globally, wave power costs are anticipated to fall; this, in tandem with unstable oil prices and unfavorable conditions for deploying small-scale offshore renewables like solar and wind, is likely to lead to the widespread adoption of networks of small-scale WECs. Using a comprehensive market-sizing approach, this paper analyzes the business case for these WEC networks, which have the potential to enable offshore industries to benefit from an "Ocean Internet of Things," or O-IoT. This market analysis reveals not only the blue economy industries most ripe for adoption, but it establishes the idea of "increasing marginal returns" for the wave energy industry stemming from widespread network effects, contrary to the "diminishing marginal returns" dominating most industries. Networks of small-scale WECs, with average power outputs around one kilowatt, will likely unlock immense value in mature, growing, and embryonic offshore industries. In a mature industry like oil and gas, WECs may enable operations like remote sensing and pipeline inspection. In a growing industry like aquaculture, WECs may enable operations like feeding and fish stock monitoring. In an embryonic industry like coral reef restoration, WECs may even enable operations like seawater electrolysis for mineral accretion. While the blue economy is expected to continue outpacing the global economy through 2030, this paper concludes that robust networks of small-scale WECs may enable this growth even further. As oil and gas and other offshore industries set sustainability targets for 2030, 2050, and beyond, WEC networks present a novel approach to decarbonize operations while unlocking new value. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {How can countries identify comparable competitors and find like-minded partners in the international trade market of blue products to achieve better blue economic growth? This paper maps the “Blue Country Space” (BCS) based on the differences in the export capacity of blue products possessed by countries and decomposes it through the hierarchical structure analysis of complex network, dividing countries into different hierarchies. The results demonstrate that countries with leading positions in the international trade market of blue products are at higher hierarchies in BCS, as evidenced by their diversification and comprehensiveness of blue products of different complexity. The paper therefore argues that better blue economic growth also implies a cascade leap in BCS. Countries should not voluntarily give up their original low-complexity blue products to achieve better development. They can also establish long-term trade partnerships through regional cooperation to enter higher hierarchies together with members in the same hierarchy. Different hierarchies reflect the differences in blue product portfolios of different complexity. Countries in the same hierarchy become the most direct competitors due to they have similar blue product export capabilities. While the competition between countries in adjacent hierarchies is relatively weak. There is no obvious competition between non-adjacent hierarchies, which tend to be more trade complementary. These findings suggest that the BCS can be used as a useful additional policy analysis tool. Each economy can use this tool to analyze differences with comparative foreign competitors. Learning from the experience of higher-hierarchy countries in managing ocean and coast industries, leading to reflections on the development of its own blue industrial structure, and contributing to the formulation of blue industrial policies by policymakers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This review engages with the ongoing blue economy debate to decipher old and emerging forms of economic, institutional, physical and social exclusions of local communities and vulnerable societies that may result from the development of ocean projects and policies across the globe. The results of this scientific and policy review show that, whereas for some traditional maritime activities such as fisheries, the drivers of exclusion are well studied and somehow addressed in policies, for other emerging sectors, such as ocean energies or deep-sea mining, there is a lack of understanding on how to recognise and prevent the different forms of exclusion. Exclusion is likely to occur when decisions are taken at the highest level of governance to achieve national or international targets of economic growth, food safety, clean energy or leisure, with little consideration of the effects on local economic, social and environmental contexts. On the other hand, when the principles of inclusiveness are given due consideration, they prove to be beneficial for the societies’ well-being, increasing the chance of long-term social acceptability. We conclude that, to embrace inclusiveness, both governments and industries have to (a) go beyond the capitalist commodification of nature and recognise benefits other than the economic ones, namely, emotional, cultural and spiritual; (b) promote initiatives that fulfil local needs in the first place and are adapted to local contexts; (c) cooperate with local institutions and stakeholders to promote the co-management of resources and adaptive development. Likewise, research institutions, funding organisations and governmental agencies have to engage in new ways to assess the effects of ocean development that go beyond the quantitative approach and seek to integrate qualitative information, traditional knowledge and local perceptions. © 2023 by the authors.},

Existing hospitality establishments promote sport fishing with angling as the main form of recreational fishing. Development of this industry is expected to generate accrued benefits of eco-tourism and community empowerment by providing alternative sources of income from the already strangled commercial and subsistence fisheries calling for diversification within the fishing industry. Key informant questionnaires were administered to County tourism and fisheries representatives, hotel directors or managers, and officials of Beach Management Units while questionnaire-led-interviews were conducted at the beaches or community recreation sites. Seven tourist resorts, one yacht club, and seven beaches/fish landing sites were assessed. The study aimed to assess the current status of recreational fishing and identify growth opportunities within the industry. Recreational fishing was concentrated around Mfangano Island targeting Nile Perch using artificial baitfish as a tackle. On average, boat hire charges including fishing tackle were USD 30 per trip (< 3 hours) and USD 100 per day per fishing trip. "Blue tourism" rating was low across the respondents with the 2007 political unrest said to have heavily impacted the number of tourists to the region. Water Hyacinth and poor water quality remain a key challenge within Winam gulf while overfishing posed a major concern in the open lake with the number of longline fishers reported to be on the rise. Resource spatial planning should be instituted to cater for the different players in the Blue Economy. The strict enforcement of the Nile Perch slot size is recommended and cooperation among industry players on access and use of the products from recreational fishing. A national census survey on recreational catches should be conducted if its full potential is to be realized in promoting blue growth. © 2023 Taylor and Francis Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Compounding these challenges, research suggests that the ability of SIDS to enact environmental governance, and their ability to mobilise international support, remain constrained by resource limitations and broader geopolitical discourses of marginality. However, Seychelles’ Government has challenged these imaginaries via its engagement with the “Blue Economy” as a framing for ocean-climate governance. This paper argues Seychelles’ construction, and utilisation, of the Blue Economy is built upon particular geopolitical imaginaries underpinning ocean-climate governance in SIDS. Drawing on elite interviews conducted in Seychelles in 2017, this paper explores how the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT) acts as a mechanism that incorporates ocean governance and climate adaptation. It argues the Blue Economy serves as a geopolitical imaginary that underpins Seychelles’ ocean-climate governance. Moreover, elites have drawn upon three separate geopolitical island imaginaries to justify Seychelle's role within the Blue Economy, Seychelles as: a pristine island state, an island of experimentation, and a large oceanic state. This paper will argue that such geopolitical imaginaries underpin ocean-climate governance through the Blue Economy and highlight the significance of considering them in analysing the Blue Economy. Further, it highlights the important insight of elite perspective in uncovering the geopolitical logics underpinning ocean-climate governance in SIDS. © 2023},

	abstract = {The rapid development of blue economy and human use of offshore space triggered the concept of co-location of marine activities and is causing diverse local pressures on the environment. These pressures add to, and interact with, global challenges such as ocean acidification and warming. This study investigates the combined pressures of climate change and the planned co-location of offshore wind farm (OWF) and aquaculture zones on the carbon flow through epifaunal communities inhabiting wind turbines in the North Sea. A 13C-labelled phytoplankton pulse-chase experiment was performed in mesocosms (4 m3) holding undisturbed hard-substrate (HS) communities, natural sediment with infauna, and mobile invertebrate predators. Carbon assimilation was quantified under current and predicted future-climate conditions (+3 °C and −0.3 pH units), as well as a future-climate co-use scenario with blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) aquaculture. Climate change induced an increase in macrofaunal carbon assimilation as well as an organic enrichment of underlying sediments. Dynamic (non-)trophic links between M. edulis and other HS epifauna resulted in shifts among the species contributing most to the phytoplankton-derived carbon flow across climate scenarios. Increased inter- and intraspecific resource competition in the presence of M. edulis aquaculture prevented a large increase in the total assimilation of phytoplankton by HS fauna. Lower individual carbon assimilation rates by both mussels and other epifauna suggest that if filter capacity by HS epifauna would approach renewal by advection/mixing, M. edulis individuals would likely grow to a smaller-than-desired commercial size. In the same scenario, benthic organic carbon mineralisation was significantly boosted due to increased organic matter deposition by the aquaculture set-up. Combining these results with in situ OWF abundance data confirmed M. edulis as the most impactful OWF AHS species in terms of (total) carbon assimilation as well as the described stress responses due to climate change and the addition of bivalve aquaculture. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The abundance of fish catches in Indonesia is excellent potential. Still, if the abundant results cannot be adequately managed and are just wasted, it will eventually lead to bad things. This problem was also found in Seraya Village, Karangasem, Bali, where large fish yields and the fish processing process were still constrained by weather and environmental conditions causing the expected results to not be achieved. To overcome this, a photovoltaic (PV) system-based fish dryer was developed that can assist the fish drying process. Utilization of this system is also supported by good solar energy potential. The system can generate 402.78 Wh of electrical energy per day, covering 104.89% of the electrical energy demand of the fish dryer. The results of statistical tests using the Mann-Whitney test for fish weight and unpaired t-test for fish moisture content showed no significant results (p>0.05). This value states that there is no difference in the results of drying fish with the PV system and the traditional method. From this, we can conclude that fish drying using a solar power system works similarly to conventional fish drying methods. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {This study investigates the managerial approaches family SMEs adopt to address sustainability in the context of the Blue Economy. Using a qualitative methodology, we conduct nine case studies of family firms operating in Sicily's COSVAP Fishing District area. The data are collected via semi-structured interviews with the founders/managers and analyzed using the Gioia method. The results reveal that family SMEs approach sustainability by adopting three managerial approaches. In the first approach, SME managers conceive sustainability as a threat to the economic sustainability of their firms. The second approach implies that sustainability must undergo specific compromises. The third approach considers sustainability as an opportunity whereby social, environmental, and economic sustainability goals are balanced. Regarding the theoretical implications, our work provides a comprehensive account of managerial approaches of family SMEs toward sustainability. The study offers insights for practitioners and policymakers concerning how to facilitate the transition of family SMEs - and, specifically, fisheries - toward sustainability.

	abstract = {Many activities associated with the expanding blue economy are characterised by high complexity, uncertainty, and significant potential for environmental impacts. In a shared marine environment, these conditions can lead to conflict, with increasingly polarised debate ultimately hindering new development. Key communication determinants of this conflict include: (i) the level of interest in the debate; (ii) the strength of attitudes; (iii) the certainty of attitudes; (iv) the level of trust between stakeholder groups; and (v) gaps in information. Using the Australian salmon industry as an exemplar of aquaculture conflict, we have run a stakeholder survey to measure each of these determinants. Implications for building effective communication strategies have been explored, addressing systemic issues such as legitimacy and credibility of information sources, message discrepancy, and negation of misinformation. The findings suggest that to reduce conflict and build community trust, communication will require targeted long-term strategies, allowing government agencies, aquaculture companies, scientists and communities to inform and be informed. Policies that promote a common dialogue and collective learning with regard to interactions between aquaculture, coastal ecosystems and communities will be critical in shifting the focus from concerns of collusion and secrecy, towards that of engagement and collaboration on impact and trust attributes. Policy makers and research agencies will also need to provide adequate resources, training, and incentives for scientists to expand their role from providing traditional technical advice, to engaging more broadly on contentious socio-ecological issues. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study presents a strategy for environmental management that aims to enhance efforts to restore threatened ecosystems. We review the exploratory system and classify the stakeholders and driving forces behind nature exploitation. Based on successful environmental management cases, we propose practical modifications for adding economic value to restoring collapsed ecosystems, resulting in the development of blue management. Blue management isolates specific stakeholders such as nature exploiters, governmental bodies, and nature scientists. We propose the division of nature users into large footprinting companies (funders), natural resources exploiters industry (managers), and subsistence exploiters (workforce) and emphasize the importance of increasing the interaction between nature exploiters and natural scientists to accelerate the restoration of threatened natural resources. Blue Management offers stakeholders practical alternatives for improving collapsed/threatened natural assets (ecosystems) based on economic, social, and ecological theories. It provides a summarized pathway for decision-makers to restore unproductive resources, avoiding the migration of the exploratory system to new pristine resources. In summary, blue management is a practical approach that combines economic, social, and ecological theories to restore threatened ecosystems. It offers decision-makers a pathway to restore unproductive resources while avoiding the exploitation of new pristine resources. Additionally, blue management has the potential to improve the research and development of technologies and systems related to nature restoration. We believe that this approach can help achieve the goals of the UN decade of ecosystem restoration and contribute to the sustainable use of natural resources. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Community members have interests in the development of marine industries such as characterise the blue economy agenda. One of these interests is levels of personal and community wellbeing. Governments, local authorities and marine industries are frequently confronted with conflicting values and interests when making decisions about marine industry development. Yet it is not clear how decisions can be made in ways that also focus on community members’ wellbeing. Assessing wellbeing is substantively different from other aspects of development assessment as it comprises (i) subjective and (ii) relational aspects as well as (iii) material aspects. We applied this three-fold wellbeing lens to investigate the connections people make between marine places and their personal wellbeing and how people perceive changes to marine places (industry development) affects this connection. We discuss three key findings: (i) people's subjective and relational experiences of personal wellbeing in relation to marine places were more important than experiences of material aspects; (ii) the specific quality of the marine environments and the values associated with the physical environment strongly influenced people's subjective and relational wellbeing experiences; and (iii) the development of marine industries may negatively influence people's experience of wellbeing in marine places if not done in ways that are sympathetic to their connections with these marine places. We discuss these findings with respect to the marine industry development and suggest that conceptualising and assessing wellbeing using only material concepts and measures in expanding marine industries will risk missing critical information in the development of sustainable local blue economies. © 2023},

We focus on desalination, an understudied aspect of the blue economy that is growing exponentially. Proponents herald desalination as a sustainable solution to increase fresh water sources, while solving socio-environmental issues left behind by the overuse of natural freshwater. However, far from being a social and environmental panacea, new political and economic interests are fused to sustain this technology with impacts for both the environment and local social systems. In this paper, we review the literature and develop a framework to understand mechanisms of dispossession via the blue economy and apply it to desalination projects in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. Drawing from a review of environmental impact assessments and declarations of environmental impacts, the research analyses communities' concerns about the impacts of desalination. Our analysis revealed (1) lack of meaningful inclusion in decision-making; (2) physical displacement of communities or from areas required for livelihoods; (3) concerns about environmental effects, and related social impacts; and (4) few social or economic benefits to local people. The research concludes that desalination is a sector of the blue economy that is opening a new sphere of dispossession in the oceans.

The nutrient levels in surface water were relatively elevated as a result of sewage and riverine inputs. As, Cd, Pb, Hg and Ag levels in sediment from Kilindini Harbor pose minimal threat to marine life whereas Cu, Zn and Ni in the sediment pose a moderate threat to marine life while Cr levels in the sediment may have a severe impact on marine life. The concentrations of trace metals, PCBs, and DDT in the surface sediment were lower than the ERL thus posing a low threat to marine organisms. DDD+DDE/DDT ratios were above 0.5 suggesting historical input of DDT from rivers Tana, Sabaki and Ramisi. Trace metal concentrations in biota from Mtwapa, Makupa and Tudor creeks were below the WHO permissible levels of heavy metals in fish.

This study employs economic contribution analysis to estimate the economic contributions of ocean recreation spending of visitors to Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS) and the coastal Georgia region. Employing economic contribution analysis is found to be more useful in influencing stakeholder decisions, and can therefore be a useful tool in providing inputs for management decisions related to marine protected areas. This study shows that visitors to coastal Georgia spent about USD 1.4 billion on ocean recreation activities in a single year. This translates to a total economic contribution of 18,950 jobs, USD 603 million labor income, USD 938 million value added, and USD 1.8 billion output. About USD 123 million of the total visitor spending can be attributed to GRNMS, contributing 1702 total jobs, USD 54 million in total labor income, USD 84 million in total value added, and USD 159 million in total output. This study highlights the importance of coastal Georgia and GRNMS as economic drivers of the region’s economy, supporting the need for continued management and investment in the Sanctuary and its resources. © 2023 by the authors.},

The physical disconnection of citizens from the marine scape, and the dominance of fishing and mining industries, has been used by state and development actors to present it as empty of socio-cultural relations. However, to declare Namibia’s coasts and ocean as forgotten unless articulated through capital is to conceal that they have been labelled “no-go” zones. I argue that, by considering exclusions and looking beyond proximity in discussions of equity and representation, the marine scape is articulated by civil society, to elucidate forms of resistance. © 2022 The Author.

	abstract = {Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing food industry globally, and proposed expansion plans include substantial increases in production over the next decades. While this will improve global food security, contribute to the blue economy and create jobs locally, the potential negative impacts on the marine environment could be massive. The existing literature suggests that further research needs to be conducted into the dynamic nature of the social-ecological systems which host aquaculture. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment survey of Norwegian households' trade-offs between salmon production and job creation, and the detrimental impacts on the marine environment. Most respondents were at the outset neutral or supportive of plans for a substantial increase in aquaculture production. However, when informed about potential environmental impacts in terms of marine plastics and salmon lice affecting wild salmon stocks, and asked to trade these off against the positive effects, the majority opposed the plans and expressed a positive willingness-to-pay to avoid the planned expansion. Applying a hybrid mixed multinomial logit model we find that income, education and to some extent age, along with environmental attitudes, explain most of the variation in people's preferences. Support for large aquaculture expansion is higher among people who consume farmed salmon frequently and those living in areas with a high density of aquaculture farms. Hence, we do not find the so-called “not in my backyard” (NIMBY) effect. These results, which arguably contrast with previous studies of environmental impacts from aquaculture, can be useful for public planners globally as they consider expanding the blue economy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The ocean and coasts are largely absent from the ‘Green New Deal’ proposal. In response to the limited attention paid to the sustainability and equitable governance approaches of the blue economy, a US ‘Blue New Deal’ has been proposed aiming to protect the health of the ocean and support coastal communities' adaptation to climate change. The Blue New Deal emerged as a central policy proposal from 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren to enhance the role of the blue economy while simultaneously addressing the climate crisis. Through a just transitions analysis, this article evaluates the proposal for a US Blue New Deal — as designed by Senator Elizabeth Warren — that would be applied towards enhancing socioeconomic resiliency, environmental justice, and addressing social inequities. As part of a critical policy analysis evaluating the areas of focus Warren's Blue New Deal presents, environmental justice and sustainability are central to the success of managing, and enhancing the role of, the blue economy. The challenges facing the Blue New Deal reflect a ‘one size fits all’ federal approach that has implications for addressing multifaceted obstacles in key sectors of the blue economy, its governance, and tackling interconnected crises that exacerbate socioeconomic inequities and vulnerabilities of marginalised coastal communities. This article proposes a blue justice framework for the Blue New Deal that seeks to address the tensions and contradictions that exist in its current form and indicates how a comprehensive policy framework can enhance the sustainability and equitable involvement of the blue economy.

	abstract = {Due to the strong interconnectedness between the ocean and our societies worldwide, improved ocean governance is essential for sustainable development in the context of the UN Ocean Decade. However, a multitude of different perspectives—ecological, societal, political, economic—and relations between these have to be understood and taken into consideration to foster transformative pathways towards marine sustainability. A core challenge that we are facing is that the ‘right’ response to complex societal issues cannot be known beforehand as abilities to predict complex systems are limited. Consequently, societal transformation is necessarily a journey towards the unknown and therefore requires experimental approaches that must enable the involvement of everyone with stakes in the future of our marine environment and its resources. A promising transdisciplinary research method that fulfils both criteria—being participatory and experimental—are real-world laboratories. Here, we discuss how real-world labs can serve as an operational framework in the context of the Ocean Decade by facilitating and guiding successful knowledge exchange at the interface of science and society. The core element of real-world labs is transdisciplinary experimentation to jointly develop potential strategies leading to targeted real-world interventions, essential for achieving the proposed ‘Decade Outcomes’. The authors specifically illustrate how deploying the concept of real-world labs can be advantageous when having to deal with multiple, overlapping challenges in the context of ocean governance and the blue economy. Altogether, we offer a first major contribution to synthesizing knowledge on the potentials of marine real-world labs, considering how they act as a way of exploring options for sustainable ocean futures. Indeed, in the marine context, real-world labs are still under-explored but are a tangible way for addressing the societal challenges of working towards sustainability transformations over the coming UN Ocean Decade and beyond.

As part of this initiative, it aims to demonstrate its influence on the development of a sustainable blue economy. Several measures are used to measure the blue economy sustainability of European countries. These measures include value added at the factor costs of crude oil extraction; gas extraction; activities related to oil and gas production; crushed stone or rock mining, clay or kaolin mining; salt extraction; as well as supporting activities engaged in the mining and quarry operations. We also use various indicators to capture digitalization performance in both the private and public sectors. During the 2009–2020 period, the European region will benefit from digital transformation in terms of improving marine minerals sustainability. Nevertheless, this effect is likely to be more apparent over the long term. Particularly, over a longer period, some aspects of digitalization in public services do have an empirically measurable effect on any components of marine minerals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Appropriate governance structures are extremely important for fishery-dependent communities in developing integrated territorial development strategies and an adaptive capacity for change, including a climate one. This paper assesses to what extent fishery co-management schemes (e.g., fishery LAGs, being regional/local governance instruments in fishing communities) are strengthening sustainability. The latter includes improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources (RES), coping with the climate crisis, minimizing environmental impacts, and promoting a sustainable blue economy. For detecting the policy aspects of aligning climate neutrality and a sustainable blue economy, the research lens focuses on the Greek Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs), given that these are mostly located in coastal/marine and insular territories with significant blue growth potential. To map and assess their capacity and efficiency in pursuing Green Deal objectives, a co-development process with FLAG managers was put in place. The results and findings of this process reveal the scarcity of sustainability and blue-economy-related strategies. The key conclusion is that a transition to a post-carbon blue economy on a local level requires an understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of fishery co-management schemes. The latter, being multi-sectoral structures, may boost dialogue and cooperation to harmonize local development strategies and EU policies. Maritime spatial planning (MSP), as an evolutionary governance process itself, can be a driver for making FLAGs evolve and strengthen commonization, blue justice, and equity for fishers. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Fishers’ local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be used to reconstruct or supplement long-term trends in heavily exploited population or poorly assessed species with low biomass. We used historical memories of small-scale fishers to understand their perceptions of changes in catch trends in marine fisheries over the last 20 years. The study aimed at evaluating how fishers could provide consistent and reliable data on major fish species/groups comparable with official catch data and to explore the potential of increasing their participation in fishery management. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews with experienced fishers and stakeholders, using a structured template related to the catch and effort data. Using FGD data, we systematically compared changes in fish catch rates and effort over time and space. Data were collected on major groups of species that had reasonable landing over time. Overall, the analysis revealed changes in catch rate, monthly landings per landing center, factors that likely influence the catch trends, and the spatial expansion of fisheries. Our study provides insight into species’ abundance over time. Fishers’ LEK shows declining catch rates for major species and groups, but monthly harvests at landing centers have increased over two decades because of increased fishing efforts. Small-scale fishers are catching more fish from deeper waters over time, indicating a geographical expansion and/or development of fisheries beyond traditionally exploited areas. Such expansions of nearshore fisheries may result from the overfishing of nearby areas. On the contrary, this could be viewed as a positive indication of the potential for growth and development of small-scale fisheries in the region, especially in the context of the blue economy. The agreement between official statistics and fishers’ data on species catch trends over time suggests that fishers have a good understanding of their fishing system. This indicates that fishers’ knowledge could be invaluable, especially in data-poor areas. LEK integration into policy and management is thus expected to facilitate the efficient management of small-scale fisheries.

	abstract = {In an emerging "blue economy," the use of large multi-purpose floating platforms in the open ocean is being considered. Such platforms could possibly support a diversified range of commercial activities including energy generation, aquaculture, seabed mining, transport, tourism, and sea-based laboratories. A Markov decision process (MDP) framework is proposed to deal with operations and maintenance (O&M) issues that are inevitable; challenges arise from the complex stochastic weather conditions that need to be accounted for. Using data as well as contrasting synthetic simulations of relevant weather variables, we demonstrate the robustness/versatility of the MDP model. Two case studies - one involving constant and another involving time-dependent downtime costs - are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed MDP framework incorporates weather patterns from available data and can offer optimal policies for distinct metocean conditions (i.e., temporal variations in the weather). A realistic example that illustrates the implementation of the proposed framework for multiple O&M issues involving salmon net pens and wave energy converters demonstrates how our optimal policies can minimize O&M costs and maximize crew safety almost as if the true future were known for scheduling. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {Urban-industrial seascapes are prevalent around the world, yet we lack a basic understanding of how the mosaic of different habitats in these areas are used by mobile marine fauna, including features such as industrial ports and marinas. Urbanised areas have been alternately characterised in scientific literature as degraded, depauperate, or in some cases diverse and abundant. To advance our spatial and temporal understanding of the community of mobile marine fauna in these areas, we used repeated sonar image sampling over large swathes of two urban-industrial seascapes, combined with underwater video. 2,341 sonar segments were captured across Mackay Harbour and the Pioneer River estuary (North Queensland, Australia). We used this information to generate a preliminary understanding of the ecology of these locations. We found that overall, urban-industrial seascapes can contain counts of mobile marine fauna similar to natural areas, and that these seascapes are characterised by dynamic diel shifts in the spatial arrangement of mobile marine fauna in the water column. At night, large fish are prevalent in the water column, while during the day, assemblages are dominated by small fish. Within these urban-industrial seascapes, deeper areas containing heavy infrastructure such as ports can harbour large densities of fish, including heavily targeted fisheries species. These areas deserve recognition as marine habitat, are of consequence to fisheries, and have the potential to influence surrounding ecosystems. Important research questions remain regarding their impact on food webs and animal movement at larger scales. Copyright © 2023 Bradley, Sheaves and Waltham.},

While available studies deal with various impacts of shrimp farming on coastal communities and the environment, there is a lack of analysis about the drivers of blue revolution. To fill this gap, this chapter examines sociopolitical and economic drivers of blue revolution in coastal Bangladesh. It particularly focuses on how state policies have provided a significant impetus to the rise in production and export of shrimp in global markets. We also synthesize scholarly literature on the social and environmental effects of shrimp aquaculture on vulnerable coastal communities. Our analysis reveals that the rise in revenue from shrimp farming has resulted in exploitation, injustice, and degradation of the coastal environment that have intensified the existing vulnerability of many disaster-stressed coastal population. Given these far-reaching effects, we call for building an inclusive policy framework for the equitable and sustainable governance of shrimp aquaculture that will promote underlying principles of the blue economy. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Mahbuba Nasreen, Khondoker Mokaddem Hossain and Mohammed Moniruzzaman Khan; individual chapters, the contributors.

This study covers aspects such as building a blue economy to achieve SDGs, the importance of a healthy ocean for current and future generations, maintaining the momentum to save the ocean, achievements of the United Nations (UN) conference on the Sustainable Blue Economy, and the highlights of the UN World Water Development Report 2020. This study specifically analyses the health effects and threats to biodiversity, adaptation and mitigation, improved wastewater management, prioritizing water, accessing climate funds, water and climate change, and the relationship between the blue economy and UN SDGs as well as identification of key stakeholders. This is achieved through a detailed literature review on the blue economy that identifies global organizations working on creating a blue economy, elements of the blue economy and current development efforts, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, sustainability and equity, ocean governance, international law and frameworks, and improvement in governance frameworks among other issues. The methodology used attempted to develop a macro, comprehensive, and systematic aggregate database at the country level on macro parameters, namely blue economy, blue finance, BE-SDGs linkages, water development, marine sector, SDGs data on SDG-14 (life underwater), SDG-6 (access to safe drinking water and sanitation), SDG-3 (good health and well-being), and optimal management of water resources through scientific techniques, such as building several small reservoirs instead of mega projects, develop small catchment dams and protect wetlands, soil management, micro catchment development, recharging of underground aquifers thus reducing the need for large dams, which has encountered challenges due to data limitations. The results of this research study emphasize broader stakeholder consultations at the global level to resolve the issues relating to blue economy, blue finance, and ocean governance. The most important conclusion and policy implications of the study are that international organizations including the United Nations, the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank are working towards achieving the SDGs in general, and the blue economy, blue finance, and ocean governance in particular. © 2022 United Nations.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the evolution of marine governance in Ireland in response to EU policy requirements in relation to the development of a sustainable blue economy in coherence with the United Nations Ocean Decade (2021-2030). In response to these EU requirements, Ireland has introduced the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) and Maritime Area Planning Act, 2021 (MAPA) in 2021 to deliver this sustainable blue economy. This new marine and coastal governance framework in Ireland reforms the consenting regime for key blue economy sectors such as Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) and sets new policy requirements for the integration of aquaculture within the MSP framework. However, the exclusion of aquaculture from the new consenting regime may hinder the full integration of the sector into MSP and impede compliance with environmental goals established by EU Directives (e.g., WFD, MSFD, MSPD). This review identifies policy and legal gaps which may impede the integration of aquaculture into the new Irish marine governance and national MSP process. Furthermore, this paper analyses aquaculture licensing cases to assess the integration of environmental criteria into planning decisions to gather insight into the readiness of the sector’s transition towards a sustainable model. The analysis from this paper indicates that the legal framework underpinning MSP in Ireland may have a limited impact on the integration of aquaculture and hinder the delivery of sustainability across all marine sectors.

	abstract = {Two pressing and overlapping marine policy issues are related to human rights in the ocean and the situation of ocean defenders. Human rights issues and violations are on the rise in the ocean due to the ongoing, rapid and unchecked escalation of anthropogenic activities in marine and coastal environments, which increasingly undermine the fundamental, civil and political, economic, social, cultural or environmental rights of individuals and groups. In this context, it is essential to recognize, support and safeguard the individuals, groups or communities who are mobilizing, advocating or taking action to protect the marine environment, coastal and oceanic territories, and associated human rights from existential threats. Yet, these ‘ocean defenders’ often face marginalization, intimidation, criminalization, threats, violence and murders. The failure to protect the human rights of coastal populations and ocean defenders needs to be urgently rectified by states, the private sector and civil society. We identify six specific areas of urgent action to protect human rights in and related to marine and coastal environments and to support and safeguard ocean defenders.

In addition to the role of carbon storage, kelp forests have certain economic impact in Japan for a long time. However, the environmental and economic effects of kelp forests are not yet clear. Therefore, this chapter introduces the environmental and economic impacts of kelp forests in Hakodate City, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, as a case study. The study suggests promoting cultivation of kelp from both ecological and economic aspects by financial schemes for conservation and restoration of natural kelp. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The blue economy concept has drawn global attention to the maritime economy, recognising expanding maritime industries such as shipping as crucial drivers of economic growth. In recent decades, seaports have correspondingly witnessed significant expansion, allowing them to play a substantial role in achieving blue growth. This study examines the challenges faced by small-scale fishing actors in gaining access to fishing livelihoods in coastal fishing communities close to Ghanaian ports. Drawing on political ecology, the study demonstrates how securitisation in port areas and dispossession has resulted in unstable fishing livelihoods in port communities. The study shows that the growth-oriented goals of port expansions and port security measures have restricted fishing communities’ access to coastal fishing spaces and caused congestion in the canoe bays of Ghana’s fishing harbours. In addition, the urbanisation around the ports has impacted fishers’ ability to meet the rising cost of living in fishing communities with fishing incomes. Furthermore, the study discusses how the new Jamestown fishing harbour complex project has displaced small-scale fishing actors and become a site of contestation between a coastal fishing community and local government authorities. In conclusion, as coastal fishing actors lose their only source of livelihood, resistance may escalate into different forms of maritime conflicts in the blue economy. The study recommends addressing the marginalisation and exclusion of traditional coastal fishing livelihoods to ensure a more equitable blue economy. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Transformation has become a prevailing and desirable concept in blue economy literature. In parallel, researchers have been considering ways to effectively engage stakeholders to support just transformational agendas. Globally, coastal communities are already being affected by the inevitable impacts of climate change and changes to the blue economy. These pressures present complex contexts for coastal zone stakeholder engagement. In this paper, I argue that taking a systems integration approach to interacting with stakeholders is needed to support just transformational change. Assessing stakeholder systems and their relationship to coastal resources is imperative for understanding dynamics that may promote or hinder just transformation. Taking an adaptive management approach to working alongside stakeholders through transitional processes, thus building capacity, is needed to generate momentum toward just transformational change. Lastly, I explain how applications of the subsidiarity principle in integrating stakeholder systems can support a just transformational process and can inform more durable transformational outcomes.
