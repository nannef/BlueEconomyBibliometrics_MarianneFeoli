The high-quality development of this industry depends on the high-level coordinated development of technological innovation system (TIS). In the present study, the coupling mechanism of industrial innovation input subsystem and innovation output subsystem was analyzed for the first time. On this basis, the development level and coupling coordination level of TIS in China’s MBI during 2008–2018 were empirically evaluated with the capacity coupling coordination model. Then, the obstacle factors were diagnosed and recognized with the obstacle model. The results showed that the innovation input index fluctuated at a low level in China’s MBI. The innovation output index has basically maintained a growth trend, whereas the quality of development was not high. Although the coupling coordination level of TIS showed a positive change as mild disordered → primary coordinated → well-coordinated, the development type of innovation system has changed from the lagging output of innovation into the lagging input of innovation. Insufficient input of innovation factors remained the main obstacle to the improvement of coordination level. Based on the above analysis, suggestions were put forward from the perspectives of policy and fund guarantees to improve the coupling coordination level in China’s MBI. © 2023, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,pharmaceutical,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s11802-023-5310-5,coordinated development;marine biopharmaceutical industry;obstacle factor;subsystem coupling;technological innovation system;Military Personnel;China,,,10.1007/s11802-023-5310-5,DOI(,10.1007/s11802-023-5310-5,DOI(10.1007/s11802-023-5310-5) OR,,,, ,

That would serve as a solution for ecosystem bioremediation, an effective utilization of marine macroalgal resources, and a new initiative to promote a green and low-carbon economy. Ulva fasciata biomass can be utilized as an organic fertilizer with total N, P2O5, and K2O contents of 3.17% and a C/N ratio of 11.71. It can also be used as a solid biofuel with a sufficient calorific value of 15.19 MJ/kg. It has high carbohydrate content and low lignin content of approximately 44.85% and 1.5%, respectively, which recommend its applicability in bioethanol and biobutanol production. Its protein, fiber, lipid, and ash contents of approximately 13.13%, 9.9%, 3.27%, and 21%, respectively with relatively high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and omega-9 fatty acids (n-9 MUFAs) and relatively low omega-6 fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs) and a n-6/n-3 ratio of 0.13 also recommend its applicability as food additives and animal feeders. Moreover, the suggested sequential zero-waste biomass residue process yielded 34.89% mineral-rich water extract (MRWE), 2.61% chlorophylla,b, 0.41% carotenoids, 12.55% starch, 3.27% lipids, 22.24% ulvan, 13.37% proteins, and 10.66% cellulose of Ulva fasciata dry weight. The efficient biocidal activity of extracted ulvan against pathogenic microorganisms and sulfate-reducing bacteria recommends its application for medical purposes, water densification, and mitigation of microbially induced corrosion in the oil and gas industry. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Oil and gas,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3390/su15097319,biopolymers;biorefinery;blue economy;Ulva fasciata;valorization;value-added products;biofuel;biomass;carbohydrate;leafy vegetable;lignin;polymer;primary sector industry;resource economy,,,10.3390/su15097319,DOI(,10.3390/su15097319,DOI(10.3390/su15097319) OR,,,,,

Its goal is to channel funding toward sustainable blue economy projects related to the ocean and freshwater. While the protection of hydric resources has gained importance within the problem of climate change, Sustainable Development Goals linked to water remain the most underfunded. Since the issuance of the first blue bond in the Seychelles in 2018, multiple public and private organizations have turned to the blue bond market to raise funds. However, unlike the green bond market, no comprehensive market overview exists, preventing stakeholders from judging whether this label has been effective in protecting water resources and drawing conclusions on its future potential. This paper draws on an extensive review of academic research and complements it with a unique and comprehensive analysis of blue bonds issued to date, providing a contribution to the literature on sustainable finance. Between 2018 and 2022, 26 blue bond transactions took place, amounting to a total value of USD 5.0 billion, with a 92% CAGR between those years. Currently, blue bonds represent less than 0.5% of the sustainable debt market. The use of proceeds has mostly focused on waste management, biodiversity, and sustainable fisheries, but also ranges across other areas of the sustainable blue economy. Only two-thirds of blue bond issuers report on impact metrics, providing further opportunity to add detail and rigor. We draw comparisons to the more mature green bond market and conclude that a lack of standardized definitions, metrics, and expertise by issuers and investors are significant barriers to the blue bond market. Resolving these barriers is crucial to attract corporations and ensure continued growth of the blue bond market. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3390/jrfm16030184,blue bonds;blue economy;blue finance;ESG;green bonds;sustainable finance;sustainable investing,,,10.3390/jrfm16030184,DOI(,10.3390/jrfm16030184,DOI(10.3390/jrfm16030184) OR,,,,,

While particular attention needs to be paid to the potential risks posed by the perspective of economic gains resulting from marine exploitation, a large public support is also required to build a sustainable society. The mass media plays a critical role in communicating scientific advances and risks, shaping opinions, and fostering behavioural change. The article discusses the media coverage of the blue economy in British newspapers through a frame analysis. The analysis reveals that the blue economy is largely framed in terms of economic opportunities and weak sustainability, and treated in a very factual, non-critical way. Sea blindness enables us to understand the lack of in-depth discussion about the blue economy and its framing as an overtly positive economic opportunity. The findings also suggest that the way the blue economy is represented proceeds from the dominant development discourse that has spread onto the marine space.

However, the management and conservation of marine ecosystems must recognize the interdependence in the coupled human and natural systems. In this study, we employed satellite remote sensing to map the spatial and temporal distribution of Secchi disk depth (SDD) in Hainan coastal waters, China for the first time, and quantitatively revealed the impacts of environmental investments on the coastal water environment in the context of global climate change. Based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in situ concurrent matchups (N = 123), a simple green band (555 nm)-based quadratic algorithm was first developed to estimate the SDD for the coastal waters of Hainan Island in China (R2 = 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.74 m). The long time-series SDD dataset (2001–2021) for Hainan coastal waters was reconstructed from MODIS observations. Spatially, SDD showed a pattern of high water clarity in eastern and southern coastal waters and low water clarity in the western and northern coastal areas. This pattern is attributed to unbalanced distributions of bathymetry and pollution from seagoing rivers. Seasonally, the humid tropical monsoon climate drove the SDD into a general pattern of high in the wet season and low in the dry season. Annually, the SDD in Hainan coastal waters improved significantly (p < 0.1), benefiting from environmental investments over the last 20 years. However, the increasing global oceanic wind speed in recent years has exacerbated sediment resuspension and deep ocean mixing, counteracting approximately 14.14% of the remedial management's effectiveness in protecting and restoring the coastal ecosystem.

The academic literature on the blue economy, almost non-existent a few years ago, is now burgeoning. The academic debate has offered some critical assessment of blue economy initiatives, but more needs to be done to address the true place of environmental protection within a blue economy, and to put people at the centre of concerns and analyses. Of particular concern, is the ambiguity of the blue economy concept and the confusion over its social and environmental sustainability, which can ultimately result in harmful practices. An important question is then how should social scientists in general and geographers, specifically, engage with these debates, and in particular how should the potential human and social costs of the blue economy be investigated and addressed while assuring justice and fairness? The papers presented here share the vision that environmental sustainability, justice and equality should be at the heart of the blue economy; not just conceptually, but practically too. The papers pursue efforts to identify blue economy risks and the mechanisms through which they occur; assess the place of inclusion and participation in a sustainable blue economy; define what blue economy policies should include to drive just and sustainable practices; and identify where the dominant understandings of the blue economy and its priorities are coming from. In other words, they put considerations of justice and broader cultural structures at the centre of their concerns and analysis. They also highlight the need to bypass geographical boundaries and gain insights from other disciplines and methodologies to grasp such an encompassing concept, and foster not just a blue economy with social justice, but a blue economy for social justice.

This article presents a unique method for assessing and quantifying seascape perception by characterizing a person viewing the geometry of seascape views both from the land and the sea. The method first utilizes a geographic information system (GIS) model to deconstruct the viewing geometry of a seascape view into five geometric elements, including (1) area of viewshed, (2) length of the visible coastline, (3) horizontal extent of the view, (4) vertical extent of the view, and (5) distance to the view. These geometric elements in the second step were reconstructed through an analytical hierarchical process (AHP) to determine the visual quality perception of participants. The results showed a significant improvement in the visual characterization of the seascape and its visual quality perception in comparison with conventional visual characterization methods.

Nowadays, cooperation on marine plastic waste management is an urgent research topic. A global consensus on management cooperation is emerging, but the economic feasibility of cooperation has not yet to be proven. This paper takes the amount of capital investment, technology level of governance and the amount of marine plastic waste to be treated as variables affecting the cooperative income to construct a cooperative network game model for marine plastic waste management from the perspective of economics. The paper distributes benefits based on the ""Myerson value"", analyzes the equilibrium conditions of the model and tests the stability of cooperation. In addition, numerical analysis is carried out using actual data from key countries to demonstrate the practical economic feasibility of cooperation in marine plastic waste management. The findings include: (1) The technology level of governance and the amount of marine plastic waste to be treated have a negative impact on the country's choice of cooperative governance strategies and the stability of cooperative alliance, while the amount of capital investment is conductive to it. (2) The size of the alliance has an impact on country's strategic choices and the stability of the alliances. Too small an alliance is not conducive to cooperative alliance building, which gradually becomes more likely as the size of the alliance increases, but it is uncertain the effect of oversized alliance and what size is most appropriate. (3) Cooperation in marine plastic waste management is economically feasible at both the theoretical and practical levels. (4) Encouraging technological innovation to improve the governance level, implementing extended producer responsibility measures to shift the management cost, exerting the positive influence of key countries to promote the stability of the alliance, and establishing a reasonable interest adjustment mechanism to coordinate the interests of all parties are helpful to build a stable and efficient cooperation alliance and improve the economic feasibility of marine plastic waste management cooperation. This paper not only provides theoretical support for the global cooperation of marine plastic waste management, but also proves the feasibility of practice and points out the direction for its practice. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105504,Cooperative network game;Economic feasibility;Marine plastic waste management;Myerson value;feasibility study;marine ecosystem;marine pollution;plastic waste;sustainable development;waste management;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105504,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105504,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105504) OR,,,,,DOI(10.1007/s11802-023-5310-5) OR DOI(10.3390/su15097319) OR DOI(10.3390/jrfm16030184) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12433) OR DOI(10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105601) OR DOI(10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117865) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12483) OR DOI(10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117696) OR TITLE(Towards stewardship of oceans: Role of G20 countries) OR DOI(10.3389/fpos.2022.1067481) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105504) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12414) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2023.1034054) OR DOI(10.1016/j.rsma.2023.102902) OR DOI(10.1007/978-981-19-4005-7_56) OR DOI(10.1080/21622671.2023.2212017) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105696) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12410) OR DOI(10.1016/j.renene.2023.04.060) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105588) OR DOI(10.1016/j.rsma.2023.102838) OR DOI(10.52305/IIXG7953) OR DOI(10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106999) OR DOI(10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.113840) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106467) OR DOI(10.3390/ijerph20085604) OR DOI(10.1016/j.geoforum.2023.103682) OR DOI(10.1007/s12524-022-01571-2) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-031-10812-9_22) OR DOI(10.1016/j.aqrep.2023.101557) OR DOI(10.3390/su15086758) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-031-10812-9_8) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12429) OR DOI(10.14321/aehm.025.04.12) OR DOI(10.3390/w15061054) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-031-10812-9) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106589) OR DOI(10.1109/IIPhDW54739.2023.10124417) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-031-24545-9_7) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-443-18816-9.00008-3) OR DOI(10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116811) OR DOI(10.18280/ijsdp.180401) OR DOI(10.1007/s13280-022-01784-2) OR DOI(10.1007/s10811-023-03001-3) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2022.1075667) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12409) OR DOI(10.3390/su15065342) OR DOI(10.11591/ijece.v13i4.pp3686-3694) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12419) OR DOI(10.1007/s11356-023-26973-8) OR DOI(10.3390/fishes8040176) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108184) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105655) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105433) OR DOI(10.1007/978-981-19-4005-7_54) OR DOI(10.1016/j.oneear.2023.01.010) OR DOI(10.1007/s41207-023-00370-6) OR DOI(10.1038/s41467-023-37854-6) OR DOI(10.1007/s12524-023-01688-y) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-031-21644-2_24) OR DOI(10.1145/3544548.3580886) OR DOI(10.4043/32236-MS) OR DOI(10.1016/C2022-0-00271-3) OR DOI(10.3390/su15043253) OR DOI(10.14321/aehm.025.04.03) OR DOI(10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159285) OR DOI(10.11591/eei.v12i3.4690) OR DOI(10.1017/jmo.2023.32) OR DOI(10.3390/en16104210) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106697) OR DOI(10.1016/j.envsci.2023.03.002) OR DOI(10.1111/anti.12890) OR DOI(10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160199) OR DOI(10.1016/j.frl.2023.104119) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12434) OR DOI(10.1002/pan3.10412) OR DOI(10.3390/su15107784) OR DOI(10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105585) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2023.974591) OR DOI(10.1115/1.4056344) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2022.1034039) OR DOI(10.4324/9781003253495-19) OR DOI(10.1111/1477-8947.12267) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2023.1075803) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2022.1089049) OR DOI(10.1007/s40152-023-00302-8) OR DOI(10.1111/geoj.12452) OR
rayyan-1032990199,Blue revitalization or dispossession? Reform of common resource management in Japanese small-scale fisheries,2023,,,Geographical Journal,,189,2,204-216,"Ganseforth, S.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117865491&doi=10.1111%2fgeoj.12414&partnerID=40&md5=9916aece19ef374ec3b1ef94eda36667,,,,"Based on in-depth anthropological field research in rural Japan, this paper analyses the ongoing reform of Japanese fishery governance and its social and environmental justice implications, as globally proliferating discourses on the ‘blue economy’ and ‘blue growth’ are driving the enclosure of one of the last vestiges of natural resource commons in small-scale fisheries. Coastal fisheries in Japan are often idealized as one of the last bastions of resource co-management in an industrialized country, with local cooperatives collectively controlling territorial fishing rights. However, demographic change, declining profitability, and dwindling resource stocks are challenging their viability. Reform of the fishery law, designed to stimulate new growth and industrialization – particularly in aquaculture – includes the opening up of coastal fishery resources to corporate investors, the strengthening of top-down regulation, and the introduction of individual fishing quotas (IQ). The desire to boost domestic seafood production also has to be seen within the context of the double anxiety of high dependency on international trade for foodstuff and of Japan's vanishing rurality. This emphasis on private capital and presupposed economic and scientific rationality builds on the same rationale of blue economy and blue growth discourses, which promise financial along with ecological returns on large-scale investments in sustainable ocean economies. Growth-oriented reform in Japan now imperils successful resource co-management in coastal small-scale fisheries. Its analysis therefore offers deeper insights into the transformative as well as dispossessive potential of the global paradigmatic shift towards an intensified industrial exploitation of the oceans. The question of social and environmental justice is central in the re-allocation of access rights to ocean spaces and resources and the re-arrangement of decision-making processes in fishery governance, as local fishing communities face a very real threat of dispossession and disempowerment.

This study adds more knowledge as it aims to investigate the causal relationships between blue economic factors – living and non-living resources, ocean energy, port activities, shipbuilding and repair, maritime transport, coastal tourism, human development indicator, per capita income, fish capture, internal renewable water resources per capita, marine protected areas, greenhouse gas emissions and population density, all factors related to maritime activities – and the blue economy (BE) itself. Methods: In order to reach these objectives, some special analytical and econometric methods are used. Among them the multivariate Granger causality theory, the correlation analysis and panel data techniques are employed. This set of methods helps us to study the complex set of relationships among the various factors related to the BE and their influence on per capita income (PCI) and economic growth. The data used to conduct this research were collected from the Eurostat, the E.U. statistical database. Several European countries and the span period 2010-2018 are used too. Results: The analysis showed evidence that per capita income is associated to other factors of the blue economy, that PCI (Granger) causes coastal tourism and population density, and that there are five other factors that positively influence PCI growth, namely, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), maritime transport, nonliving resources and ports’ activities. This paper adds some new understandings to theory and calls the attention to society, in general, and the blue economics, in particular. For instance, if policymakers want to increase income per capita of these regions, they should take action on some variables such as human development indicator (HDI), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, living resources, maritime transport and ocean energy. The results reveal that blue economy is a good alternative to promote both economic growth and PCI. Discussion: The concerns that make up the blue economy, such as ocean energy, port activities, ship building and repair, maritime transport, coastal tourism, HDI, maritime fish capture, marine protected areas, and GHG reductionare good factors to stimulate economic growth. Among these, the most influencing are maritime transport, living resources and the production of ocean energy. This study adds knowledge to theory, innovates in the methods and techniques used, in the results discovered, in its discussion, and in the mixture of blue economic factors, too.

Mangrove forests absorb CO2 three times higher than terrestrial forests and tropical rainforests. Moreover, mangrove forests can be a source of Indonesian income in the form of a blue economy. Therefore, an accurate method is needed to investigate mangrove carbon stock. The utilisation of remote sensing data with the results of the above-ground carbon (AGC) detection model of mangrove forests based on multispectral imaging and vegetation index can be a solution to obtain fast, cheap, and accurate information related to AGC estimation. This study aimed to investigate the best model for estimating the AGC of mangroves using Sentinel-2 imagery in Benoa Bay, Bali Province. The Random Forest (RF) method was used to classify the difference between mangrove and non-mangrove by treating several parameters. Furthermore, a semi-empirical approach was used to assess and map the AGC of mangroves. Allometric equations were used to calculate and produce AGC per species. Moreover, the model was built with linear regression equations for one variable x and multiple regression equations for more than one x variable. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to assess the validation of the model results. The results of the mangrove forests area detected in the research location around 1,134.92 ha, with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 0.984 and a kappa coefficient of 0.961. This study highlights that the best model was the combination of IRECI and TRVI vegetation indices (RMSE: 11.09 Mg/ha) for a model based on red edge bands. Meanwhile, the best results from the model that does not use the red edge band were the combination of TRVI and DVI vegetation indices (RMSE: 13.63 Mg/ha). The use of red edge and NIR bands is highly recommended in building the AGC model of mangrove forests because they can increase the accuracy value. Thus, the results of this study are highly recommended in estimating the AGC of mangrove forests because it has been proven to increase the accuracy value of previous studies using optical images. © 2023 by Forest and Society.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.24259/fs.v7i1.22062,Carbon stock;Coastal zone;Mangrove forests;Model;Sentinel image;Vegetation indices;Bali;Indonesia;Lesser Sunda Islands;Sunda Isles;carbon dioxide;coastal zone;mangrove;mapping;modeling;satellite data;Sentinel;vegetation index;Vegetables,,,10.24259/fs.v7i1.22062,DOI(,,,,,,,"DOI(10.4324/9781003001324-25) OR DOI(10.1080/14683857.2022.2067406) OR DOI(10.1016/j.seares.2021.102149) OR DOI(10.4031/MTSJ.56.1.10) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.752764) OR DOI(10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100164) OR DOI(10.1163/22119000-12340239) OR DOI(10.1088/2516-1083/ac1509) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104847) OR DOI(10.1007/s10668-021-01378-0) OR DOI(10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102372) OR DOI(10.4031/MTSJ.56.1.15) OR DOI(10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000712) OR DOI(10.1186/s12302-021-00502-1) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104673) OR DOI(10.1080/18366503.2021.1954494) OR DOI(10.1080/03056244.2022.2042239) OR TITLE(Fishing For Survival in the ‘Blue Economy’– Found Poems From the Irish Islands) OR DOI(10.1088/1755-1315/925/1/012028) OR DOI(10.5957/TOS-2022-010) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104623) OR DOI(10.4031/MTSJ.56.1.9) OR DOI(10.1080/18366503.2021.1962052) OR DOI(10.1134/S1063074021060067) OR DOI(10.3390/su13168936) OR DOI(10.3390/en14165048) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.681546) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105774) OR DOI(10.3390/w14020198) OR DOI(10.3390/su132212478) OR DOI(10.4031/MTSJ.56.1.7) OR DOI(10.1007/s40152-021-00238-x) OR TITLE(Data and Management Strategies for Recreational Fisheries with Annual Catch Limits) OR DOI(10.4031/MTSJ.56.1.13) OR DOI(10.1007/s10113-021-01853-4) OR DOI(10.1007/s40152-021-00240-3) OR DOI(10.35716/IJED/21200) OR DOI(10.1111/gcb.15827) OR DOI(10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117091) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.674594) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-323-90427-8.00014-9) OR DOI(10.1016/j.rser.2021.111424) OR DOI(10.3390/jmse9111212) OR DOI(10.3390/md20010064) OR DOI(10.1038/s41467-021-23168-y) OR DOI(10.4031/MTSJ.56.1.11) OR DOI(10.1111/ppl.13534) OR DOI(10.1088/1755-1315/934/1/012039) OR DOI(10.30827/cuadgeo.v60i3.15953) OR TITLE(Alternative policies based on blue economy for the skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) fishery management of Jayapura City, Papua, Indonesia) OR DOI(10.3390/su13169481) OR DOI(10.4031/MTSJ.56.1.16) OR DOI(10.1163/22119000-12340241) OR DOI(10.1109/AFRICON51333.2021.9570904) OR DOI(10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102397) OR DOI(10.3390/su131810004) OR DOI(10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128988) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104735) OR DOI(10.1109/MNET.011.2100197) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104668) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104700) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.681619) OR DOI(10.21664/2238-8869.2022v11i1.p165-180) OR DOI(10.1163/22116001-03601003) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105703) OR DOI(10.1163/22119000-12340238) OR DOI(10.1039/d1gc03191k) OR DOI(10.1088/1755-1315/860/1/012091) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-92491-1_9) OR DOI(10.1098/rstb.2021.0125) OR DOI(10.3390/su132111563) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.735741) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104880) OR DOI(10.1016/j.renene.2021.08.127) OR"

The Yellow fin Sea Bream (A. latus) is found in coastal belts and locally known as “Dhandya”. Variation analysis between fish species were studied, using mitochondrial DNA. To understand genetic diversity of fish, mitochondrial DNA D-loop provides a good source of information for the management as well as the selective breeding of the sea fauna. Methods: The current study was focus on variation analysis, phenotypic and genetic variation in A. latus fish found in different region of coastal belt of Baluchistan. A total of forty-five fish A. latus from three different areas of Baluchistan (Gaddani, Dam, and Kund Malir) were collected aseptically. The Phenotypic study was done on the bases of their body shape, body color and color of the fins. Four different kinds of A. latus were observed and named as type A, B, C and D. The genetic characteristics were studied by observing the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region. Results: For Mitochondrial DNA analysis, the blood samples were collected from the selected samples and processed for DNA extraction. Primer was designed and PCR was performed. PCR products were sequenced and analyzed for observing genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA of A. latus. Conclusion: The analysis revealed three genetic variations; two heterozygous variations at 32 and 172 nucleotide positions (Adenine substituted by Thymine and Thymine substituted by Guanine) and one homozygous variation at 72 nucleotide position (an insertion of a Thymine). © 2023, The Running Line.

Design/methodology/approach We conducted a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications indexed in one of the largest international citation databases of peer-reviewed literature (Scopus) for the past 5 years. The following terms were selected: Blue Economy, Ocean Economy, Blue Growth, Ecosystem-Based Management and Marine Spatial Planning. For the detailed search query, we adopted the classification of the traditional and emerging sectors of the Ocean Economy, developed by the OECD, and integrated relevant keywords (equivalents) from the marine economy framework classification of the EU, US and China Blue Economy sectors. Findings The results show that non-regional actors (like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada) have been actively involved in the research agenda in the field of the Blue Economy, inter alia in the Black Sea Region, while the representation of the regional stakeholders (in particular, the BSEC Member States) is relatively low. The majority of the countries in the Black Sea Region are involved in the common scientific research agenda related to the Blue/Ocean Economy, including its traditional and emerging marine (ocean-based) sectors. Ecosystem-Based Management is underrepresented as a research area. The Black Sea Region significantly lacks academic-corporate collaboration in the field of the Blue Economy. Originality/value The current studies related to the development of the Blue Economy as a scientific area of research specifically in the Black Sea Region are underrepresented in the academic literature. The study allowed us to identify the countries from the Black Sea Region that are leading in terms of the research related to the Blue/Ocean Economy, as well as determine research trends for international cooperation related to the development of Blue/Ocean Economy in the Black Sea Region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1007/978-981-19-4005-7_56,Bibliometric analysis;Black Sea Region;Blue Economy;Ecosystem-Based Management;International cooperation;Marine Spatial Planning;Research areas;African Continental Ancestry Group,,,10.1007/978-981-19-4005-7_56,DOI(,10.1007/978-981-19-4005-7_56,DOI(10.1007/978-981-19-4005-7_56) OR,,,,,DOI(10.1007/978-981-15-8369-8) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00020-2) OR DOI(10.1080/19480881.2021.1935523) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-69193-6_14) OR TITLE(Policy Insights to Maritime Economy in Pakistan) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00060-3) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00046-9) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.02027-8) OR DOI(10.1080/1523908X.2020.1856054) OR DOI(10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705960) OR DOI(10.1590/2675-2824069.21017TS) OR TITLE(Safe and Environment-friendly approach to recycling of Tanker ship) OR DOI(10.2458/jpe.2899) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.02006-0) OR DOI(10.1590/2675-2824069.21009ksc) OR DOI(10.15517/rbt.v69iSuppl.1.46388) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00027-5) OR DOI(10.1080/19480881.2021.1970440) OR DOI(10.34190/EIE.21.120) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00002-0) OR DOI(10.1139/anc-2020-0012) OR DOI(10.1590/2675-2824069.21019mc) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00022-6) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00057-3) OR DOI(10.1080/19392206.2021.1982241) OR TITLE(ITALIAN PORTS AS THE COUNTRY’S STRATEGIC ASSET.

The Floating Island Project is a spatial and technological fix for the perceived failures of governance by contemporary states and territories justified by claiming that seasteading could offer solutions for coastal and island states facing the deleterious consequences of climate change. TSI’s experiments in governance are not just experiments in the management of populations–they are efforts to perpetuate capitalist accumulation regimes. Using Marxist rhetorical analysis to understand how TSI, Blue Frontiers and the government of French Polynesia attempted to sell seasteading in documents and news articles, social media posts, including other literature on seasteading, the human and more-than-human geographies of the ocean, geographies of volume, and critical literature on the ‘green’ and ‘blue’ economies, allows us to examine how TSI, its spinoff organization Blue Frontiers, and French Polynesia’s government sought to secure sustainable economic development in French Polynesia and political and economic autonomy for the seastead through controlling oceanic space. © 2023 Regional Studies Association.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1080/21622671.2023.2212017,accumulation;blue economy;capitalism;seasteading,,,10.1080/21622671.2023.2212017,DOI(,10.1080/21622671.2023.2212017,DOI(10.1080/21622671.2023.2212017) OR,,,,,DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-821431-2.00037-8) OR DOI(10.1098/rstb.2019.0458) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.00269) OR DOI(10.1016/j.oneear.2020.01.008) OR DOI(10.1111/conl.12716) OR DOI(10.3390/JMSE8100739) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104058) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105015) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105187) OR DOI(10.18543/BAIDC-57-2020PP147-169) OR DOI(10.1007/s10811-020-02044-0) OR DOI(10.4018/978-1-7998-4318-4.ch012) OR DOI(10.1680/jmaen.2019.29) OR DOI(10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100575) OR DOI(10.1007/s40152-020-00168-0) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103773) OR DOI(10.1016/j.oneear.2020.11.011) OR DOI(10.1108/MABR-01-2020-0006) OR DOI(10.2112/JCR-SI112-068.1) OR DOI(10.2112/SI106-090.1) OR DOI(10.1038/d41586-020-03303-3) OR DOI(10.2112/SI95-162.1) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103775) OR DOI(10.1016/C2019-0-02984-6) OR DOI(10.4038/SLJSS.V43I1.7641) OR DOI(10.1016/j.oneear.2019.12.016) OR DOI(10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138256) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104294) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104301) OR DOI(10.1029/2019EA000954) OR DOI(10.1016/j.envint.2020.105528) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104137) OR DOI(10.3390/su12114654) OR DOI(10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100584) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104157) OR DOI(10.1088/1755-1315/423/1/012051) OR DOI(10.1016/B978-0-12-818536-0.00029-4) OR DOI(10.3390/jmse8090684) OR DOI(10.1111/anu.13063) OR DOI(10.1016/j.oneear.2019.12.017) OR DOI(10.3390/antiox9121183) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.584861) OR DOI(10.1163/9789004412026_006) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-61075-3_104) OR DOI(10.1080/19392206.2020.1724432) OR DOI(10.1002/ieam.4255) OR DOI(10.2478/ttj-2020-0006) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111645) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104283) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106772) OR DOI(10.2112/SI106-002.1) OR DOI(10.1108/WHATT-10-2019-0070) OR DOI(10.1111/anti.12593) OR DOI(10.1093/oso/9780198841654.003.0002) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.00672) OR DOI(10.2112/SI95-287.1) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.00586) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103973) OR DOI(10.1080/17583004.2020.1808765) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-44975-9_16) OR DOI(10.3390/atmos11101036) OR DOI(10.1080/09669582.2020.1747475) OR DOI(10.4314/wiojms.v19i1.6) OR DOI(10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139024) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.563205) OR DOI(10.1038/s41559-020-1259-6) OR DOI(10.2112/SI95-183.1) OR DOI(10.1038/s41586-020-2913-5) OR DOI(10.1002/aqc.3257) OR DOI(10.25283/2223-4594-2020-2-97-108) OR DOI(10.25501/SOAS.00033484) OR DOI(10.4337/9781788112239.00021) OR DOI(10.1109/IEEECONF38699.2020.9389228) OR DOI(10.4018/978-1-7998-5036-6.ch008) OR DOI(10.1142/11937) OR DOI(10.1111/1477-8947.12193) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104271) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103843) OR DOI(10.1007/978-981-15-4883-3_14) OR DOI(10.1016/j.dib.2020.105847) OR DOI(10.1007/s40152-020-00164-4) OR DOI(10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.021) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.00795) OR DOI(10.1007/978-981-15-5550-3_6) OR TITLE(Towards Blue Economy: A Perspective) OR DOI(10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100572) OR

Operating in novel environments for these industries inherently fosters uncertainty in outcomes generated by a complex suite of hazards, some of which are unknown prior to deployment. Faced with such uncertainty, a precautionary, flexible, and cross-disciplinary (integrated) approach is recommended to optimize the potential for hazards to be identified in a timely, comprehensive, and robust manner, and mitigated. However, relevant disciplines – such as aquaculture production, marine engineering, and marine renewable energy design, and associated interactions with society and the environment – often evolve with their siloed techniques and lexicons. Here we first provide an overview of selected discipline-specific approaches to hazard analysis as a first step in a pathway that can generate a holistic synthesis of hazards to and from multiple emerging sectors in novel environments. Despite challenges of applying these individual methods to cross-disciplinary projects for emerging industries, we then identify where disciplines share methodological approaches and where opportunities exist to develop integrated methods. With a growing focus on sustainable economic growth and optimizing the use of ocean space through multi-use, our review highlighted that the emerging offshore Blue Economy could benefit from the development of a flexible, integrated approach to identify and assess hazards in a comprehensive, robust and useful manner for successful planning, development, and operations. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105696,Aquaculture;Impacts;Ocean management;Renewable energy;Risk;Seafood production;Sustainability,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105696,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105696,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105696) OR,,,,,DOI(10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.107943) OR DOI(10.5102/rdi.v17i2.6975) OR DOI(10.29133/yyutbd.698092) OR TITLE(Use of space for a sustainable ocean economy: Environmental issues related to the deep seabed and space exploration) OR TITLE(Identifying skill shortages and education and training gaps for the shipbuilding industry in europe) OR DOI(10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971487) OR DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00751-3) OR DOI(10.15351/2373-8456.1105) OR DOI(10.15304/rge.29.3.6956) OR DOI(10.30892/gtg.31307-530) OR DOI(10.1080/1755876X.2018.1543982) OR DOI(10.1111/fme.12311) OR DOI(10.1007/978-981-15-5144-4_1) OR DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00764-y) OR DOI(10.1007/s10811-019-01889-4) OR DOI(10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.02.020) OR DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00754-0) OR DOI(10.1145/3372177.3373329) OR DOI(10.15351/2373-8456.1116) OR DOI(10.15351/2373-8456.1118) OR DOI(10.1007/s12571-019-00950-x) OR DOI(10.1038/s41893-019-0404-1) OR DOI(10.1080/03056244.2020.1853517) OR DOI(10.31838/jcr.07.08.289) OR DOI(10.15351/2373-8456.1099) OR DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00763-z) OR DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.00646) OR DOI(10.5593/sgem2020/5.2/s21.066) OR DOI(10.5751/ES-11304-250102) OR DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104897) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103702) OR DOI(10.1016/bs.amb.2019.08.003) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-29377-2_13) OR TITLE(NOAA working to advance our Nation's blue economy) OR DOI(10.1080/08920753.2020.1803563) OR DOI(10.1080/17538947.2019.1574317) OR DOI(10.1080/09733159.2020.1845457) OR TITLE(Use case of quay crane container handling operations monitoring using ICT to detect abnormalities in operator actions) OR DOI(10.18848/2325-1166/CGP/v16i01/51-63) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-60080-8_6) OR DOI(10.34190/EIE.20.150) OR TITLE(The blue economy of cetaceans) OR DOI(10.1117/12.2571705) OR DOI(10.1007/978-981-13-8743-2_19) OR DOI(10.1080/23308249.2020.1795615) OR DOI(10.1080/09733159.2020.1785087) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.04.002) OR DOI(10.1080/18366503.2019.1633988) OR DOI(10.1016/j.rser.2019.01.060) OR DOI(10.1080/1523908X.2019.1680274) OR DOI(10.15244/pjoes/118747) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-40671-4_8) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103633) OR DOI(10.2112/JCR-SI111-067.1) OR DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.01.010) OR DOI(10.1080/19480881.2019.1625215) OR DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00766-w) OR DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00748-y) OR DOI(10.1111/gec3.12445) OR DOI(10.3989/estgeogr.202055.055) OR DOI(10.15211/SOVEUROPE42020102111) OR DOI(10.1111/anu.12890) OR DOI(10.23919/OCEANS40490.2019.8962706) OR DOI(10.1109/MNET.001.1900131) OR TITLE(Growth of the blue economy) OR DOI(10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W13-1525-2019) OR DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-34630-0_2) OR DOI(10.1080/17530350.2019.1639066) OR DOI(10.15351/2373-8456.1107) OR DOI(10.1007/s10668-018-0133-z) OR DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00777-7) OR DOI(10.3390/su11185080) OR

This paper argues that a quintuple helix approach to stakeholder engagement – involving government, academia, the business community, and civil society – and an inclusive transdisciplinary action research (TAR) methodology are promising avenues with which to do so. Embracing critical pragmatism as a foundational framework, key ideas from three strands of research are consolidated: (1) the recent work on the geographical dimension of socio-technical sustainability transitions; (2) the literature on just sustainabilities and just transition; and (3) action research and transdisciplinary approaches to problem solving. This allows for the reimagination of a common future for the blue economy that is developed through a different kind of democratic process driven and informed by co-learning, and shared experiences. By adopting a transdisciplinary action research approach, actors from different disciplines and spheres of experience can gain a better mutual understanding and find commonality through the open door of collaboration. The theoretical argument presented in this paper is illustrated by a vignette of an ongoing TAR project at Southern Connecticut State University, which outlines the challenges and opportunities inherent to implementing a TAR approach.

As a renewable energy resource, wave energy is more predictable and has a higher power density compared to solar and wind. However, the technology for wave energy harvesting is still relatively nascent. One of the major challenges as the sector developers is the lack of spatial–temporal representation of wave resources, or wave power generation, from a generic WEC. This paper proposes a novel Wave Net Power Assessment (WNPA) method by utilizing the theoretical Wave Energy Converter (WEC) power limits (including the radiation power limits, Budal's limit, and gross wave power), and applies it to a decade of wave conditions across the USA East Coast, West Coast and Hawaiian Islands. The WNPA method assesses the wave resource from device point of view (unlike traditional gross wave resource assessment) and is generally applicable to WECs regardless of dimension, size, and degrees of freedom (DoFs). The geospatial application of the WNPA method allowed for the analysis of wave power production potential along U.S. coastlines and provides WEC developers meaningful data to make decisions about the best spatial region to deploy certain WECs. Numerical simulations are conducted for WECs with 5 different sizes, 3 different operating modes across the West Coast, East Coast, and Hawaii over 10 years. In addition, productivity, efficiency and gross power quality comparisons are made in terms of the size and degree-of-freedom for WECs deployed at certain ocean sites (e.g., PacWave). A few of the most important findings: (1) The net wave power is dramatically smaller than the gross wave power, which indicates the new WNPA method has a more conservative assessment of the wave power potential; (2) A heaving 10 m WEC is found to have the highest (compared to other sizes and degrees of freedom) absorption efficiency on the West Coast and Hawaii; (3) For smaller 2 m surging/pitching WECs, ocean sites on the East Coast (e.g., Diamond Shoals, NC) maximize power production. (4) There are distinct trade-offs between maximizing power or minimizing power quality and dependencies exists between the location of interest, the WEC size, and the priority degree of freedom. The proposed methodology can be utilized by WEC technology and project developers to conduct apriori preliminary analysis of WEC deployment locations and device characteristics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.renene.2023.04.060,Budal's limit;Geospatial analysis;Powering the blue economy;Radiation power limit;Wave energy conversion;Wave resource assessment;Atlantic Coast [North America];Atlantic Coast [United States];Hawaii [United States];Hawaiian Islands;Pacific Coast [North America];Pacific Coast [United States];United States;Climate change;Degrees of freedom (mechanics);Economic and social effects;Energy harvesting;Energy policy;Power quality;Wave power;Budal limit;Geo-spatial analysis;Radiation power;Resource assessments;Wave resource;absorption efficiency;alternative energy;climate change;economic analysis;ocean;resource assessment;spatial analysis;wave energy;wave power,,,10.1016/j.renene.2023.04.060,DOI(,10.1016/j.renene.2023.04.060,DOI(10.1016/j.renene.2023.04.060) OR,,,,,

This is the case for governance of the blue economy, focused on sustainable development of marine resources. Here, the relevant policy and legislative arrangements are fragmented, and marine uses, activities and resources are generally managed on a sectoral basis by independent entities from multiple jurisdictions. In Australia, for example, complex arrangements have created uncertainty in relation to what, when, how, and by whom blue economy activities are possible. Network approaches to map and analyse complex systems could potentially improve our understanding and facilitate management of policy and legal complexity. Yet, there are few studies that have adopted such approaches in ocean governance. Our research demonstrates the application of an innovative approach based on network graphs and text mining to analyse a policy and legislative system associated with Australia's blue economy (i.e., policy and legal arrangements applicable to the coastal and marine areas within the seaward boundaries of the continental shelf around the State of Tasmania). Using a database of over 2000 international, federal, state policy and legislative arrangements, cross-sector analyses were undertaken to identify potential gaps and overlaps that may hinder the deployment of blue economy activities, particularly those relating to integrated seafood and energy production systems. Our graphs allowed quick and easy visualisation of policy and legislative clusters around government entities, relationships between those entities and clusters, as well as potential gaps and overlaps in the existing policy and legislative landscape. Results point to a lack of integration and a need for fit-for-purpose policy and legislation, particularly for the development of co-located blue economy activities. Our approach may be used in research of other complex governance settings to inform policymaking as well as for communication and educational purposes. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105588,Aquaculture;Blue economy;Marine Law;Ocean governance;Offshore renewable energy;Policy Analysis;Australia;alternative energy;aquaculture;economic activity;economic policy;marine policy;policy analysis;sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105588,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105588,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105588) OR,,,,,

An overlay visualization of key themes shows that the key focus in recent years includes acoustic telemetry, bioacoustics, conservation, and reproduction. More innovations in the hydroacoustic method are needed, such as (1) Multi-field application, (2) Application to environmental monitoring, and (3) Simplified sampling design and analysis technique. Moreover, other applications could be further explored, such as the effect of changes in the fish ecosystem, climate change, pollution, and other disruptions, that could further aid the scientific community in contributing towards a blue economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.rsma.2023.102838,Bibliometric analysis;Blue economy;Fisheries acoustic;Hydroacoustic method;PRISMA;Bibliometrics,,,10.1016/j.rsma.2023.102838,DOI(,10.1016/j.rsma.2023.102838,DOI(10.1016/j.rsma.2023.102838) OR,,,,,

However, these developments may cause externalities, primarily affecting users dependent on maritime space and its seascapes, such as Tourism and Recreation (T&R). The marine renewable expansion, in general, is expected by some of the actors involved to affect T&R with the prospect of decreasing local welfare and the number of visitors. Nonetheless, this influence over Coastal and Maritime Tourism & Recreation is not well addressed by academic papers. Here we assess this literature gap via a semi-systematic narrative meta-synthesis (SSNMS) which expands on the methodology and results of two guiding reference studies (Scottish Government, 2008; Parsons & Firestone, 2018) to conjecture about this topic. The SSNMS promotes the evaluation studies produced between 2015 and 2019 selected through a rigorous investigation of relevant peer-reviewed keywords in Scopus and Web of Science. The analysis revealed that the studied knowledge gap persists and that OWFs can indeed impact coastal communities dependent on maritime tourism and recreational activities, despite the obligatory Environmental Impact Assessment for OWFs. However, both negative and positive impacts greatly vary with development stages and locations. Nevertheless, results still provide valuable conclusions common to generic coastal areas dealing with offshore wind farms sitting. In the few cases where authors consider T&R in their impact analysis, the results indicate a lack of public sensitivity and participation. Higher clarity and participation in the process might play a key role in generating optimistic attitudes toward OWF projects and positive synergies in between the local Blue Economy actors. In conclusion, the projected negative impacts mainly emerge as a reaction to the absence of proper integration between local T&R stakeholders and OWF developers, demonstrating that adverse effects are mitigable and preventable. Furthermore, the results indicate that a distinctive Tourism & Recreation Impact Assessment should be part of the obligatory technical assessments submitted by the OWF developers in coastal areas that rely on these activities. © 2022","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,neutral,tourism,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106999,Coastal management;Impact assessment;Marine spatial planning;Maritime multi-use;Offshore wind energy;Recreation;Tourism;Climate change;Coastal zones;Electric utilities;Environmental impact assessments;Investments;Offshore oil well production;Coastal area;Impact assessments;Marine Spatial Planning;Meta-synthesis;Off-shore wind energy;Wind energy development;Wind farm developers;analytical method;autonomy;climate change;coastal zone management;environmental impact assessment;marine policy;methodology;offshore application;recreational management;spatial planning;tourism management;wind farm;wind power;Offshore wind farms,,,10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106999,DOI(,10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106999,DOI(10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106999) OR,,,,,

This paper maps the “Blue Country Space” (BCS) based on the differences in the export capacity of blue products possessed by countries and decomposes it through the hierarchical structure analysis of complex network, dividing countries into different hierarchies. The results demonstrate that countries with leading positions in the international trade market of blue products are at higher hierarchies in BCS, as evidenced by their diversification and comprehensiveness of blue products of different complexity. The paper therefore argues that better blue economic growth also implies a cascade leap in BCS. Countries should not voluntarily give up their original low-complexity blue products to achieve better development. They can also establish long-term trade partnerships through regional cooperation to enter higher hierarchies together with members in the same hierarchy. Different hierarchies reflect the differences in blue product portfolios of different complexity. Countries in the same hierarchy become the most direct competitors due to they have similar blue product export capabilities. While the competition between countries in adjacent hierarchies is relatively weak. There is no obvious competition between non-adjacent hierarchies, which tend to be more trade complementary. These findings suggest that the BCS can be used as a useful additional policy analysis tool. Each economy can use this tool to analyze differences with comparative foreign competitors.

This is a comprehensive review and synthesis of the outcome of previous empirical studies conducted on anthropogenic nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and phytoplankton productivity and community composition with a particular focus on harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Kenya's coastal and marine waters. Our results indicate that localized nutrient pollution occurs in estuaries and creeks adjacent to urban areas. Nitrogen speciation was characterized by high ammonium relative to nitrate concentrations with evidence of nitrogen limitation (N: P < 16). Based on all studies' average chlorophyll a concentration, seawater in coral and seagrass ecosystems was classified as mesotrophic, mangroves and nearshore as higher mesotrophic, and estuarine and creeks as eutrophic. Additionally, 44 species of potential toxin-producing HAB-forming species belonging to 22 genera were established in low abundances (3±2 - 210±11 cells/l) below the standards of HAB's warning thresholds. Their drivers, spatial and temporal trends are, however, unclear. This review revealed the existence of localized nutrient pollution and a low abundance of toxin-producing HABs species in Kenya's coastal waters. The existing data is, however, very fragmented and inadequate to guide coastal managers in addressing the problem of anthropogenic nutrient pollution and HABs in the area. We, therefore, recommend the inclusion of anthropogenic nutrients and toxic HABs in routine water quality monitoring in the area, especially in potential fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, and recreational sites. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106454,Coasts;Harmful algal blooms;Kenya;Nitrogen;Phosphorus;Phytoplankton;Primary production;Algae control;Eutrophication;Fisheries;Marine biology;Nutrients;Toxic materials;Water quality;Anthropogenics;Coastal waters;Localised;Marine waters;Mesotrophic;Nutrient composition;Nutrient pollution;algal bloom;coastal water;community composition;phytoplankton;primary production;seagrass;seawater;water quality;Military Personnel;Food,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106454,DOI(,,,,,,,

Compounding these challenges, research suggests that the ability of SIDS to enact environmental governance, and their ability to mobilise international support, remain constrained by resource limitations and broader geopolitical discourses of marginality. However, Seychelles’ Government has challenged these imaginaries via its engagement with the “Blue Economy” as a framing for ocean-climate governance. This paper argues Seychelles’ construction, and utilisation, of the Blue Economy is built upon particular geopolitical imaginaries underpinning ocean-climate governance in SIDS. Drawing on elite interviews conducted in Seychelles in 2017, this paper explores how the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT) acts as a mechanism that incorporates ocean governance and climate adaptation. It argues the Blue Economy serves as a geopolitical imaginary that underpins Seychelles’ ocean-climate governance. Moreover, elites have drawn upon three separate geopolitical island imaginaries to justify Seychelle's role within the Blue Economy, Seychelles as: a pristine island state, an island of experimentation, and a large oceanic state. This paper will argue that such geopolitical imaginaries underpin ocean-climate governance through the Blue Economy and highlight the significance of considering them in analysing the Blue Economy.

In a shared marine environment, these conditions can lead to conflict, with increasingly polarised debate ultimately hindering new development. Key communication determinants of this conflict include: (i) the level of interest in the debate; (ii) the strength of attitudes; (iii) the certainty of attitudes; (iv) the level of trust between stakeholder groups; and (v) gaps in information. Using the Australian salmon industry as an exemplar of aquaculture conflict, we have run a stakeholder survey to measure each of these determinants. Implications for building effective communication strategies have been explored, addressing systemic issues such as legitimacy and credibility of information sources, message discrepancy, and negation of misinformation. The findings suggest that to reduce conflict and build community trust, communication will require targeted long-term strategies, allowing government agencies, aquaculture companies, scientists and communities to inform and be informed. Policies that promote a common dialogue and collective learning with regard to interactions between aquaculture, coastal ecosystems and communities will be critical in shifting the focus from concerns of collusion and secrecy, towards that of engagement and collaboration on impact and trust attributes.

We review the exploratory system and classify the stakeholders and driving forces behind nature exploitation. Based on successful environmental management cases, we propose practical modifications for adding economic value to restoring collapsed ecosystems, resulting in the development of blue management. Blue management isolates specific stakeholders such as nature exploiters, governmental bodies, and nature scientists. We propose the division of nature users into large footprinting companies (funders), natural resources exploiters industry (managers), and subsistence exploiters (workforce) and emphasize the importance of increasing the interaction between nature exploiters and natural scientists to accelerate the restoration of threatened natural resources. Blue Management offers stakeholders practical alternatives for improving collapsed/threatened natural assets (ecosystems) based on economic, social, and ecological theories. It provides a summarized pathway for decision-makers to restore unproductive resources, avoiding the migration of the exploratory system to new pristine resources. In summary, blue management is a practical approach that combines economic, social, and ecological theories to restore threatened ecosystems.

Such understanding requires the use of modern exploration technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles, in order to acquire quality information for decision-making processes. This paper addresses the design process for an underwater glider, to be used in oceanographic research, that was inspired by leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), which are known to have a superior diving ability and enhanced hydrodynamic performance. The design process combines elements from Systems Engineering and bioinspired design approaches. The conceptual and preliminary design stages are first described, and they allowed mapping the user’s requirements into engineering characteristics, using quality function deployment to generate the functional architecture, which later facilitated the integration of the components and subsystems. Then, we emphasize the shell’s bioinspired hydrodynamic design and provide the design solution for the desired vehicle’s specifications. The bioinspired shell yielded a lift coefficient increase due to the effect of ridges and a decrease in the drag coefficient at low angles of attack. This led to a greater lift-to-drag ratio, a desirable condition for underwater gliders, since we obtained a greater lift while producing less drag than the shape without longitudinal ridges. © 2023 by the authors.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.3390/biomimetics8010080,bioinspired design;environmental monitoring;marine robotics;oceanographic research;underwater glider,,,10.3390/biomimetics8010080,DOI(,,,,,,,

The social and environmental impacts of the growth of the blue economy are a matter of some concern for local people who may experience few benefits and substantial negative impacts. One way that these impacts of the blue economy occur is through subtle or overt forms of dispossession that result from the growth of technologies and infrastructures at sea or on the land (e.g., offshore oil rigs, ships, ports, processing facilities, etc.). We focus on desalination, an understudied aspect of the blue economy that is growing exponentially. Proponents herald desalination as a sustainable solution to increase fresh water sources, while solving socio-environmental issues left behind by the overuse of natural freshwater. However, far from being a social and environmental panacea, new political and economic interests are fused to sustain this technology with impacts for both the environment and local social systems. In this paper, we review the literature and develop a framework to understand mechanisms of dispossession via the blue economy and apply it to desalination projects in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. Drawing from a review of environmental impact assessments and declarations of environmental impacts, the research analyses communities' concerns about the impacts of desalination. Our analysis revealed (1) lack of meaningful inclusion in decision-making; (2) physical displacement of communities or from areas required for livelihoods; (3) concerns about environmental effects, and related social impacts; and (4) few social or economic benefits to local people. The research concludes that desalination is a sector of the blue economy that is opening a new sphere of dispossession in the oceans.

This sector not only has the potential to provide renewable feedstock but its cultivation and processing ticks an important box for sustainable development. Seaweed cultivation in India is gaining momentum and great attention is being given to developing the infrastructure. A flagship program ‘Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)’ has provided adequate budgetary allocation to achieve a production of 11.2 Mt (fresh) feedstock. However, the scheme seems to focus only on material benefits (product development) and the ecosystem services, especially regulatory services have seldom been taken into consideration. Thus, the present article tries to address the estimation of potential regulatory ecosystem services [capture carbon, uptake nutrients and heavy metals (Cr, Co, Cd)] met through Kappaphycus alvarezii farming, at the Pan-India level. The estimates were made for both tube net and raft cultivation methods separately. The farm cover was estimated to be around 700,000 ha supporting approximately 780,000 farmers for tube net, while it was 56,000 ha supporting ~ 1.25 million farmers for raft cultivation. A total number of tube nets that would be put to use would be 140 million and 56 million in the case of rafts. Once the target is achieved India would have gained the ability to annually capture approximately 600,000 t of carbon, 22,000 t of nitrogen, and 2000 t of phosphorous and absorb more than 1000 t of heavy metals cumulatively. Nevertheless, a monetary valuation of ecosystem services is needed to arrive at rational decisions by policy-makers and resource managers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s10811-023-03001-3,Carbon capture;Ecosystem services;Heavy metal absorption;Nutrient uptake;Regulatory services;Seaweed cultivation;India;Ecosystem,,,10.1007/s10811-023-03001-3,DOI(,10.1007/s10811-023-03001-3,DOI(10.1007/s10811-023-03001-3) OR,,,,,

China, Japan, and Republic of Korea (ROK)are now aware of the importance of this issue to their surrounding waters and their country’s development. However,the poor implementation of marine governance gives rise to the unsatisfactory effect of marine plastic waste governance in the sea area. Based on the concept of blue economy and the data of plastic pollution in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, this paper discusses the feasibility of establishing binding legal norms and policies to promote the progress of marine plastic waste treatment in China, Japan and Republic of Korea. By using research methods of text analysis and status survey, this paper analyzes the differences and common demands of China, Japan and Republic of Korea for marine plastic pollution control. It is concluded that three countries have common demands in the management of the whole life cycle of marine plastic pollution, the establishment of flexible legal instruments, and the participation of stakeholders. Finally, through the case experience of the blue cycle model of marine plastic waste in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China, this paper proposes that this model can also be used in the management of marine plastic waste in China, Japan and Republic of Korea. Three countries can gradually promote the cooperation of marine plastic waste laws and regulations by starting with the treatment of\ fishery plastic waste, and innovate the blue cycle model, so as to finally promote the conclusion of the regional marine waste treatment agreement.

Coastal margins will be shrinking as sea levels rise due to climate change, squeezing already scarce port resources, exacerbating competition for these spaces, and generating conflicts. This paper focuses on the competition for waterfront space on the Thames River of Connecticut bordered by the municipalities of New London, Groton, Norwich, Ledyard, and Montville. Emerging wind power in the new Blue Economy looks to reshape port usage in the Thames River. The recent focus on wind generation by the State of Connecticut, coupled with several competitive bidding events for wind-generated electricity, has augmented demand for port space that will serve as a staging area for this offshore development. Although the development of wind power will occur offshore, Connecticut ports are anticipating port use by wind companies with winning bids.

A more holistic and comprehensive understanding and framing of what a sustainable blue economy is, is required to avoid perpetuation of the ecological and social problems of conventional economic growth. New understandings of blue economy which place justice, resilience, and sustainability centrally are required if the blue economy concept is to retain credibility in the context of ongoing climate disruptions, socio-economic challenges, and the progressive degradation of coastal ecosystems. The blue economy needs to represent a practical, real-world solution to these issues for coastal communities striving for sustainability. While ideas of ‘just transition’ have been afforded considerable attention in the literature, here the argument is forwarded for a ‘just disruptions’ approach, underpinned by presentation of a novel framework. The ‘just disruptions’ framework posits that rights-based and capabilities-based approaches to justice, including principles of distributive and procedural justice, be applied to inform adaptive and resilience focused responses in coastal zones. Applying these principles in practice, the realities of space, place, scale, and power relations need to be acknowledged and more deliberately considered.

Plastics in the ocean damage biodiversity and marine ecosystem services that the blue economy relies upon. The present work analyses and reviews the literature on plastic pollution and the background knowledge about marine plastic pollution in Morocco. The economy of Morocco depends mainly on marine activities, including fisheries, tourism, and maritime trade. These sectors were identified as the main in-situ sources of plastics entering Moroccan coastal waters. The analysis results showed that the increasing abundance of plastics in such marine systems causes substantial economic loss to blue economy activities. In contrast, the lack of data on the plastic waste quantity entering Moroccan water is a limiting factor for assessing plastic pollution. This highlights the need for a risk assessment and more field investigations to value the weight impacts of marine activities generators of plastics on biodiversity and the economy. In addition, implementing laws and rules forbidding the disposal of plastic waste (PW) in public spaces, mainly beaches, and streets, is urgently needed. Raising awareness of plastic waste management and prioritizing improved waste collection, sorting, and management would boost Morocco’s establishment and adoption of circular economy strategies.

While these engineered structures provide new marine habitat resources, from the viewpoint of biodiversity, they effectively support a sub-set of species found in natural habitats. Unlike previous studies that have used divers for fish visual census, we used a remotely operated vessel with an underwater camera to examine the fish community using floating pontoons in a marina facility in tropical central Queensland, Australia. The camera filmed continuously the edge and underside of pontoons (both surveys covered similar pontoon linear distances – July (winter) 430m; November (summer) 485m; 2021). Fifteen fish species representing 14 families were recorded, with more species observed during summer compared to the winter survey. Remarkably, across both surveys of the 243 fishes individuals that were recorded, 166 (68%) appeared upside-down in videos (i.e., oriented to the underside of the pontoon). Engaging a behaviour of swimming upside-down has been acknowledged in natural habitats elsewhere; some coral reef species living in caves or reef ledges orientate themselves to the cave ceiling or overhanging ledge to increase prey capture rate. However, this is the first study to record fishes exhibiting the same behaviour. We conclude that our less invasive video survey approach provided the opportunity to observe fishes in a state of natural behaviour, orientating themselves towards the pontoon substrate, which is probably simply a response of adhering to basic characteristic modes, i.e., it is the orientation relative to the substrate that is important, rather than their orientation in space per se. Indeed marina pontoons provide an additional feature in already habitat complex estuaries; these data add to why we need to consider the ecosystem services offered by marine infrastructure, and the plasticity of fish to adapt to new environments in an expanding blue economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Others,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108184,Blue economy;Ecological engineering;Estuaries;Fish;ROV;Underwater video;Australia;Queensland;autonomous underwater vehicle;ecological engineering;estuary;floating body;prey capture;Robotics,,,10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108184,DOI(,10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108184,DOI(10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108184) OR,,,,,

This study explores the role of foresight in co-creating alternative, preferred futures for a sustainable blue economy looking towards 2030 and in establishing an interdisciplinary dialogue about research and innovation opportunities to achieve these futures. To this end, a foresight exercise is conducted with marine scientists and researchers in 6 countries in Europe. The exercise is designed in three stages: scanning, scenario-building and strategic orientation, and uses a combination of foresight methods to encourage creative thinking and exploration. The scenarios developed in the study describe alternative future worlds built on the establishment of self-sustaining communities and engaged societies; the diffusion of digitalisation and growth of blue biotechnologies; booming ecosystem services and open and collaborative research infrastructures that impact different sectors of the blue economy. A portfolio of research and innovation areas is developed that aims to inspire new research directions in four domains: (i) integrated ocean management tools; (ii) closed loop, circular polyculture systems; (iii) co-creation of innovation and transdisciplinary research; and (iv) open access and collaborative databases supporting ecosystem services. The study highlights the role of foresight in bridging across disciplinary perspectives and industry sectors. Foresight can be used to complement Decision-Support Systems and other quantitative approaches for research agenda-setting and for decision-making on policies addressing sustainability in the marine sciences. The process contributes to futures skills-building at institutional level and helps establish a futures mindset for strategic planning. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105433,Blue economy;Foresight;Interdisciplinary science;Marine science;Stakeholder participation;Sustainable development;Europe;decision support system;innovation;local participation;marine policy;research institution;stakeholder;sustainability,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105433,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105433,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105433) OR,,,,,

However, considerable amounts of seafood waste and by-products are generated along the seafood value and supply chain, from the sea to the consumer table, causing severe environmental damage and significant economic loss. Therefore, innovative solutions and alternative approaches are urgently needed to ensure a better management of seafood discards and mitigate their economic and environmental burdens. The use of emerging technologies, including the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) innovations (such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, smart sensors, and the Internet of Things, and other advanced technologies) to reduce and valorize seafood waste and by-products could be a promising strategy to enhance blue economy and food sustainability around the globe.

Despite efforts to maximize social benefits from climate, development, and conservation, externally driven processes can converge to amplify vulnerabilities and inequalities. Pre-existing social injustices increase the sensitivity of affected individuals to change and limit their capacity to adapt or benefit from the interacting impacts of triple exposure. We argue that external implementors cannot effectively and equitably achieve climate, economic, and conservation goals without prioritizing social justice and building general resilience. We therefore recommend that implementors: (1) address root causes of vulnerability, namely pre-existing social injustices; (2) use participatory systems approaches to improve understanding of local contexts and potential consequences of proposed initiatives; and (3) leverage inclusive partnerships to facilitate collaborative design and implementation.

Furthermore, islands are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, as the rising sea level and extreme events are expected to induce severe impacts. Such hazards are anticipated to also affect the operations of the maritime transport sector by affecting either the port infrastructure or ships en route. The present study is an effort to better comprehend and assess the future risk of maritime transport disruption in six European islands and archipelagos, and it aims at supporting regional to local policy and decision-making. We employ state-of-the-art regional climate datasets and the widely used impact chain approach to identify the different components that might drive such risks. Larger islands (e.g., Corsica, Cyprus and Crete) are found to be more resilient to the impacts of climate change on maritime operations. Our findings also highlight the importance of adopting a low-emission pathway, since this will keep the risk of maritime transport disruption similar to present levels or even slightly decreased for some islands because of an enhanced adaptation capacity and advantageous demographic changes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Shipping,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s41207-023-00370-6,Blue economy;Climate change;Impacts;Islands;Maritime transport;Mediterranean,,,10.1007/s41207-023-00370-6,DOI(,10.1007/s41207-023-00370-6,DOI(10.1007/s41207-023-00370-6) OR,,,,,

India, which accounts for 7.56% of global production, is the second-largest producer of marine foods. This industry accounts for around 1.24% of India’s Gross Value Added (GVA). Seafood (fish, prawns, etc.) continues to provide a vital source of healthy and nutritious food, revenue, and financial assistance to millions of people throughout the world, particularly in India. The sector employs around 28 million people at the primary level and over 50 million individuals along the value chain. Over the previous 3 years, the yearly average growth rate in this industry has been 7%. Seafood is one of the best alternatives for reducing hunger and nutrient shortage since it is a low-cost, high-protein source. The main difficulties in culture fisheries are low average production because of poor technological adoption, illness prevalence, and a lack of high-quality seed and affordable feed for targeted species. Better governance, aquaculture farming, seafood, policy support, and capacity building are all critical activities for the country’s blue economy ambitions. This diagnostic chapter seeks to comprehend the current level of production and product development, notably in the aquaculture industry in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Shrinkage of the fertile land-based agriculture industry gave up a new avenue for growth in Andhra Pradesh, India. Obviously, coastal zones are the state’s bountiful natural resources.

As R&D funding for wave energy converters (WECs) continues to rise globally, wave power costs are anticipated to fall; this, in tandem with unstable oil prices and unfavorable conditions for deploying small-scale offshore renewables like solar and wind, is likely to lead to the widespread adoption of networks of small-scale WECs. Using a comprehensive market-sizing approach, this paper analyzes the business case for these WEC networks, which have the potential to enable offshore industries to benefit from an ""Ocean Internet of Things,"" or O-IoT. This market analysis reveals not only the blue economy industries most ripe for adoption, but it establishes the idea of ""increasing marginal returns"" for the wave energy industry stemming from widespread network effects, contrary to the ""diminishing marginal returns"" dominating most industries. Networks of small-scale WECs, with average power outputs around one kilowatt, will likely unlock immense value in mature, growing, and embryonic offshore industries. In a mature industry like oil and gas, WECs may enable operations like remote sensing and pipeline inspection. In a growing industry like aquaculture, WECs may enable operations like feeding and fish stock monitoring. In an embryonic industry like coral reef restoration, WECs may even enable operations like seawater electrolysis for mineral accretion. While the blue economy is expected to continue outpacing the global economy through 2030, this paper concludes that robust networks of small-scale WECs may enable this growth even further. As oil and gas and other offshore industries set sustainability targets for 2030, 2050, and beyond, WEC networks present a novel approach to decarbonize operations while unlocking new value. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.4043/32236-MS,Commerce;Costs;Internet of things;Offshore oil well production;Offshore technology;Wave energy conversion;Blue economies;Business case;Embryonics;Fundings;Marginal returns;Offshore industry;Oil and gas;Power costs;Small scale;Wave energy converters;Remote sensing;Internet,,,10.4043/32236-MS,DOI(,10.4043/32236-MS,DOI(10.4043/32236-MS) OR,,,,,

Being autochthonous to Africa, Family clarotidae catfishes are very popular for fisheries, owing to their, abundance, population resilience, and reasonable economic value. To identify the status of genetic diversity of Chrysichthys species in Lake Nasser,Egypt, i.e. C. auratus and C. rueppelli specimens were collected from different side extensions (Khors or Fjords) of the Lake, that were Ghazal, Garf Hussein, Hamedo, Shenyara, Amada and Toshka. Mitochondrial Cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) hypervariable 5′ region was sequenced in all samples. The sequences were subjected to several genetic, phylogenetic, and population genetic analyses. Both DNA barcoding and COI-based phylogenies revealed that both C. auratus and C. rueppelli have the same mitochondrial genome sequence. Furthermore, the level of haplotype diversity of Chrysichthys in Lake Nasser was higher than that known for most Nile fishes. All sites showed high haplotype diversities, especially in the Northernmost parts of the Lake, the nearest to the high dam. Samples from all Khors showed signs of recent population expansion, non-significant raggedness, and mismatch curves with either unimodal or skewed unimodal patterns. All Lake Nasser Chrysichthys populations appeared to be completely mixed. The current study provided three key novelties over all previous works. The first was the identical mitochondrial barcode sequences between C. auratus and C. rueppelli. The second was the high genetic diversity within the sampled individuals.

The results of this scientific and policy review show that, whereas for some traditional maritime activities such as fisheries, the drivers of exclusion are well studied and somehow addressed in policies, for other emerging sectors, such as ocean energies or deep-sea mining, there is a lack of understanding on how to recognise and prevent the different forms of exclusion. Exclusion is likely to occur when decisions are taken at the highest level of governance to achieve national or international targets of economic growth, food safety, clean energy or leisure, with little consideration of the effects on local economic, social and environmental contexts. On the other hand, when the principles of inclusiveness are given due consideration, they prove to be beneficial for the societies’ well-being, increasing the chance of long-term social acceptability. We conclude that, to embrace inclusiveness, both governments and industries have to (a) go beyond the capitalist commodification of nature and recognise benefits other than the economic ones, namely, emotional, cultural and spiritual; (b) promote initiatives that fulfil local needs in the first place and are adapted to local contexts; (c) cooperate with local institutions and stakeholders to promote the co-management of resources and adaptive development. Likewise, research institutions, funding organisations and governmental agencies have to engage in new ways to assess the effects of ocean development that go beyond the quantitative approach and seek to integrate qualitative information, traditional knowledge and local perceptions. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3390/su15043253,blue economy;blue growth;inclusiveness;local communities;marine governance;government;ocean;organization;perception;research institution;resource development;resource economy;traditional knowledge,,,10.3390/su15043253,DOI(,10.3390/su15043253,DOI(10.3390/su15043253) OR,,,,,

Existing hospitality establishments promote sport fishing with angling as the main form of recreational fishing. Development of this industry is expected to generate accrued benefits of eco-tourism and community empowerment by providing alternative sources of income from the already strangled commercial and subsistence fisheries calling for diversification within the fishing industry. Key informant questionnaires were administered to County tourism and fisheries representatives, hotel directors or managers, and officials of Beach Management Units while questionnaire-led-interviews were conducted at the beaches or community recreation sites. Seven tourist resorts, one yacht club, and seven beaches/fish landing sites were assessed. The study aimed to assess the current status of recreational fishing and identify growth opportunities within the industry. Recreational fishing was concentrated around Mfangano Island targeting Nile Perch using artificial baitfish as a tackle. On average, boat hire charges including fishing tackle were USD 30 per trip (< 3 hours) and USD 100 per day per fishing trip. ""Blue tourism"" rating was low across the respondents with the 2007 political unrest said to have heavily impacted the number of tourists to the region. Water Hyacinth and poor water quality remain a key challenge within Winam gulf while overfishing posed a major concern in the open lake with the number of longline fishers reported to be on the rise. Resource spatial planning should be instituted to cater for the different players in the Blue Economy. The strict enforcement of the Nile Perch slot size is recommended and cooperation among industry players on access and use of the products from recreational fishing.

These pressures add to, and interact with, global challenges such as ocean acidification and warming. This study investigates the combined pressures of climate change and the planned co-location of offshore wind farm (OWF) and aquaculture zones on the carbon flow through epifaunal communities inhabiting wind turbines in the North Sea. A 13C-labelled phytoplankton pulse-chase experiment was performed in mesocosms (4 m3) holding undisturbed hard-substrate (HS) communities, natural sediment with infauna, and mobile invertebrate predators. Carbon assimilation was quantified under current and predicted future-climate conditions (+3 °C and −0.3 pH units), as well as a future-climate co-use scenario with blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) aquaculture. Climate change induced an increase in macrofaunal carbon assimilation as well as an organic enrichment of underlying sediments. Dynamic (non-)trophic links between M. edulis and other HS epifauna resulted in shifts among the species contributing most to the phytoplankton-derived carbon flow across climate scenarios. Increased inter- and intraspecific resource competition in the presence of M. edulis aquaculture prevented a large increase in the total assimilation of phytoplankton by HS fauna. Lower individual carbon assimilation rates by both mussels and other epifauna suggest that if filter capacity by HS epifauna would approach renewal by advection/mixing, M. edulis individuals would likely grow to a smaller-than-desired commercial size. In the same scenario, benthic organic carbon mineralisation was significantly boosted due to increased organic matter deposition by the aquaculture set-up. Combining these results with in situ OWF abundance data confirmed M. edulis as the most impactful OWF AHS species in terms of (total) carbon assimilation as well as the described stress responses due to climate change and the addition of bivalve aquaculture. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,negative,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159285,Aquaculture;Carbon assimilation;Climate change;Mesocosm experiment;Offshore wind farm;Animals;Carbon;Ecosystem;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Mytilus edulis;Seawater;Atlantic Ocean;North Sea;Biogeochemistry;Electric utilities;Molluscs;Offshore oil well production;Organic carbon;Phytoplankton;organic carbon;organic matter;sea water;carbon;'current;Blue economies;Carbon flow;Colocations;Future climate;Hard substrate;Mesocosms;Organic matter processing;aquaculture;climate change;epifauna;mesocosm;phytoplankton;wind farm;Article;carbon fixation;climate;controlled study;ecosystem;environment;microalga;nonhuman;pH;predator;sediment;simulation;temperature;animal;human;physiology;Offshore wind farms,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159285,DOI(,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159285,DOI(10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159285) OR,,,,,

This problem was also found in Seraya Village, Karangasem, Bali, where large fish yields and the fish processing process were still constrained by weather and environmental conditions causing the expected results to not be achieved. To overcome this, a photovoltaic (PV) system-based fish dryer was developed that can assist the fish drying process. Utilization of this system is also supported by good solar energy potential. The system can generate 402.78 Wh of electrical energy per day, covering 104.89% of the electrical energy demand of the fish dryer. The results of statistical tests using the Mann-Whitney test for fish weight and unpaired t-test for fish moisture content showed no significant results (p>0.05). This value states that there is no difference in the results of drying fish with the PV system and the traditional method.

Using a qualitative methodology, we conduct nine case studies of family firms operating in Sicily's COSVAP Fishing District area. The data are collected via semi-structured interviews with the founders/managers and analyzed using the Gioia method. The results reveal that family SMEs approach sustainability by adopting three managerial approaches. In the first approach, SME managers conceive sustainability as a threat to the economic sustainability of their firms. The second approach implies that sustainability must undergo specific compromises. The third approach considers sustainability as an opportunity whereby social, environmental, and economic sustainability goals are balanced. Regarding the theoretical implications, our work provides a comprehensive account of managerial approaches of family SMEs toward sustainability. The study offers insights for practitioners and policymakers concerning how to facilitate the transition of family SMEs - and, specifically, fisheries - toward sustainability.

Areas of agreement between the two approaches were identified and results compared with existing national and global classifications and published biodiversity patterns.

While this will improve global food security, contribute to the blue economy and create jobs locally, the potential negative impacts on the marine environment could be massive. The existing literature suggests that further research needs to be conducted into the dynamic nature of the social-ecological systems which host aquaculture. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment survey of Norwegian households' trade-offs between salmon production and job creation, and the detrimental impacts on the marine environment. Most respondents were at the outset neutral or supportive of plans for a substantial increase in aquaculture production. However, when informed about potential environmental impacts in terms of marine plastics and salmon lice affecting wild salmon stocks, and asked to trade these off against the positive effects, the majority opposed the plans and expressed a positive willingness-to-pay to avoid the planned expansion. Applying a hybrid mixed multinomial logit model we find that income, education and to some extent age, along with environmental attitudes, explain most of the variation in people's preferences. Support for large aquaculture expansion is higher among people who consume farmed salmon frequently and those living in areas with a high density of aquaculture farms. Hence, we do not find the so-called “not in my backyard” (NIMBY) effect.

In response to the limited attention paid to the sustainability and equitable governance approaches of the blue economy, a US ‘Blue New Deal’ has been proposed aiming to protect the health of the ocean and support coastal communities' adaptation to climate change. The Blue New Deal emerged as a central policy proposal from 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren to enhance the role of the blue economy while simultaneously addressing the climate crisis. Through a just transitions analysis, this article evaluates the proposal for a US Blue New Deal — as designed by Senator Elizabeth Warren — that would be applied towards enhancing socioeconomic resiliency, environmental justice, and addressing social inequities. As part of a critical policy analysis evaluating the areas of focus Warren's Blue New Deal presents, environmental justice and sustainability are central to the success of managing, and enhancing the role of, the blue economy. The challenges facing the Blue New Deal reflect a ‘one size fits all’ federal approach that has implications for addressing multifaceted obstacles in key sectors of the blue economy, its governance, and tackling interconnected crises that exacerbate socioeconomic inequities and vulnerabilities of marginalised coastal communities. This article proposes a blue justice framework for the Blue New Deal that seeks to address the tensions and contradictions that exist in its current form and indicates how a comprehensive policy framework can enhance the sustainability and equitable involvement of the blue economy.

However, a multitude of different perspectives—ecological, societal, political, economic—and relations between these have to be understood and taken into consideration to foster transformative pathways towards marine sustainability. A core challenge that we are facing is that the ‘right’ response to complex societal issues cannot be known beforehand as abilities to predict complex systems are limited. Consequently, societal transformation is necessarily a journey towards the unknown and therefore requires experimental approaches that must enable the involvement of everyone with stakes in the future of our marine environment and its resources. A promising transdisciplinary research method that fulfils both criteria—being participatory and experimental—are real-world laboratories. Here, we discuss how real-world labs can serve as an operational framework in the context of the Ocean Decade by facilitating and guiding successful knowledge exchange at the interface of science and society. The core element of real-world labs is transdisciplinary experimentation to jointly develop potential strategies leading to targeted real-world interventions, essential for achieving the proposed ‘Decade Outcomes’. The authors specifically illustrate how deploying the concept of real-world labs can be advantageous when having to deal with multiple, overlapping challenges in the context of ocean governance and the blue economy. Altogether, we offer a first major contribution to synthesizing knowledge on the potentials of marine real-world labs, considering how they act as a way of exploring options for sustainable ocean futures. Indeed, in the marine context, real-world labs are still under-explored but are a tangible way for addressing the societal challenges of working towards sustainability transformations over the coming UN Ocean Decade and beyond.

This paper assesses to what extent fishery co-management schemes (e.g., fishery LAGs, being regional/local governance instruments in fishing communities) are strengthening sustainability. The latter includes improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources (RES), coping with the climate crisis, minimizing environmental impacts, and promoting a sustainable blue economy. For detecting the policy aspects of aligning climate neutrality and a sustainable blue economy, the research lens focuses on the Greek Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs), given that these are mostly located in coastal/marine and insular territories with significant blue growth potential. To map and assess their capacity and efficiency in pursuing Green Deal objectives, a co-development process with FLAG managers was put in place. The results and findings of this process reveal the scarcity of sustainability and blue-economy-related strategies. The key conclusion is that a transition to a post-carbon blue economy on a local level requires an understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of fishery co-management schemes. The latter, being multi-sectoral structures, may boost dialogue and cooperation to harmonize local development strategies and EU policies. Maritime spatial planning (MSP), as an evolutionary governance process itself, can be a driver for making FLAGs evolve and strengthen commonization, blue justice, and equity for fishers. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3390/su15107784,blue economy;blue equity;climate change;commonization;evolutionary governance;fisheries co-management;fishing communities;FLAGs;Greece;Green Deal;local development;maritime spatial planning (MSP);comanagement;equity;European Union;fishery management;fishing community;future prospect;governance approach;green job;spatial planning;sustainability,,,10.3390/su15107784,DOI(,10.3390/su15107784,DOI(10.3390/su15107784) OR,,,,,

Saint Martin's shoreline constantly changes due to natural and manmade erosion and accretion. Since no previous work has been done, this research uses geospatial and statistical methods to evaluate spatial and temporal shoreline changes on Saint Martin Island from 1974 to 2021 and anticipated changes between 2032 and 2042. The study used the Normalized Difference Water Index and Tasseled Cap Transformation tools to extract shorelines from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat satellite images with resolutions of 60 m in 1974 and 30 m in 1988, 2001, 2013, and 2021. Then, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) calculated shoreline change for each year using End Point Rate (EPR), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) methods. Global Positioning System (GPS) was also used to measure accuracy and shoreline change intensity. Around 253 transects were placed at 50 – m intervals along the island's coast, with approximately 55% of the transects indicating erosion, the remaining indicating accretion, and just 1% in stable condition. The research reveals that Uttar Para experiences the most dramatic shoreline alterations among the five coastal zones, with minimum erosion rates of −2.21 m/yr due to high tidal waves. Aside from that, Dakhin Para has the highest accretion rates, up to a maximum of 4.81 m/yr, due to the coral colonies' protection. Nazrul Para, Purba Para, Majer Para, Deil Para, and Eastern Galachipa erode and accrete moderately. Paschim Para, Uttar Para, and the eastern edge of the Dakhin Para coastline length are exceptionally high-risk areas, according to the Shoreline Length Intensity Index. In contrast, there is a low-risk index on the western side of the Dakhin Para and Deil Para coastlines. The LRR technique yields the best shoreline change estimates, with average erosion at −2.13 m/yr and accretion at 1.4 m/yr across 12.65 km from 1974 to 2021. The Kalman Filter Model (KFM) predicts Saint Martin's coastline will erode at a minimum rate of −2.33 m/yr by 2032 and -2.73 by 2042. Conversely, the coastline could accrete 2.09 m/yr in 2032 and 2.45 m/yr in 2042. Lower NRMSE values of 0.09 provide a highly accurate KFM for shoreline validation methods. Shoreline validation has an NRMSE of 0.16, indicating better agreement between field-derived and satellite-based shoreline positions. Finally, recognizing eroding and accreting hotspots along the Saint Martin Island coast can assist academicians, policymakers, and stakeholders.

We used historical memories of small-scale fishers to understand their perceptions of changes in catch trends in marine fisheries over the last 20 years. The study aimed at evaluating how fishers could provide consistent and reliable data on major fish species/groups comparable with official catch data and to explore the potential of increasing their participation in fishery management. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews with experienced fishers and stakeholders, using a structured template related to the catch and effort data. Using FGD data, we systematically compared changes in fish catch rates and effort over time and space. Data were collected on major groups of species that had reasonable landing over time. Overall, the analysis revealed changes in catch rate, monthly landings per landing center, factors that likely influence the catch trends, and the spatial expansion of fisheries. Our study provides insight into species’ abundance over time. Fishers’ LEK shows declining catch rates for major species and groups, but monthly harvests at landing centers have increased over two decades because of increased fishing efforts. Small-scale fishers are catching more fish from deeper waters over time, indicating a geographical expansion and/or development of fisheries beyond traditionally exploited areas. Such expansions of nearshore fisheries may result from the overfishing of nearby areas. On the contrary, this could be viewed as a positive indication of the potential for growth and development of small-scale fisheries in the region, especially in the context of the blue economy. The agreement between official statistics and fishers’ data on species catch trends over time suggests that fishers have a good understanding of their fishing system. This indicates that fishers’ knowledge could be invaluable, especially in data-poor areas. LEK integration into policy and management is thus expected to facilitate the efficient management of small-scale fisheries.

Using data as well as contrasting synthetic simulations of relevant weather variables, we demonstrate the robustness/versatility of the MDP model. Two case studies - one involving constant and another involving time-dependent downtime costs - are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed MDP framework incorporates weather patterns from available data and can offer optimal policies for distinct metocean conditions (i.e., temporal variations in the weather). A realistic example that illustrates the implementation of the proposed framework for multiple O&M issues involving salmon net pens and wave energy converters demonstrates how our optimal policies can minimize O&M costs and maximize crew safety almost as if the true future were known for scheduling. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Urbanised areas have been alternately characterised in scientific literature as degraded, depauperate, or in some cases diverse and abundant. To advance our spatial and temporal understanding of the community of mobile marine fauna in these areas, we used repeated sonar image sampling over large swathes of two urban-industrial seascapes, combined with underwater video. 2,341 sonar segments were captured across Mackay Harbour and the Pioneer River estuary (North Queensland, Australia). We used this information to generate a preliminary understanding of the ecology of these locations. We found that overall, urban-industrial seascapes can contain counts of mobile marine fauna similar to natural areas, and that these seascapes are characterised by dynamic diel shifts in the spatial arrangement of mobile marine fauna in the water column. At night, large fish are prevalent in the water column, while during the day, assemblages are dominated by small fish. Within these urban-industrial seascapes, deeper areas containing heavy infrastructure such as ports can harbour large densities of fish, including heavily targeted fisheries species. These areas deserve recognition as marine habitat, are of consequence to fisheries, and have the potential to influence surrounding ecosystems.

In response to these EU requirements, Ireland has introduced the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) and Maritime Area Planning Act, 2021 (MAPA) in 2021 to deliver this sustainable blue economy. This new marine and coastal governance framework in Ireland reforms the consenting regime for key blue economy sectors such as Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) and sets new policy requirements for the integration of aquaculture within the MSP framework. However, the exclusion of aquaculture from the new consenting regime may hinder the full integration of the sector into MSP and impede compliance with environmental goals established by EU Directives (e.g., WFD, MSFD, MSPD). This review identifies policy and legal gaps which may impede the integration of aquaculture into the new Irish marine governance and national MSP process. Furthermore, this paper analyses aquaculture licensing cases to assess the integration of environmental criteria into planning decisions to gather insight into the readiness of the sector’s transition towards a sustainable model. The analysis from this paper indicates that the legal framework underpinning MSP in Ireland may have a limited impact on the integration of aquaculture and hinder the delivery of sustainability across all marine sectors.

Human rights issues and violations are on the rise in the ocean due to the ongoing, rapid and unchecked escalation of anthropogenic activities in marine and coastal environments, which increasingly undermine the fundamental, civil and political, economic, social, cultural or environmental rights of individuals and groups. In this context, it is essential to recognize, support and safeguard the individuals, groups or communities who are mobilizing, advocating or taking action to protect the marine environment, coastal and oceanic territories, and associated human rights from existential threats. Yet, these ‘ocean defenders’ often face marginalization, intimidation, criminalization, threats, violence and murders. The failure to protect the human rights of coastal populations and ocean defenders needs to be urgently rectified by states, the private sector and civil society. We identify six specific areas of urgent action to protect human rights in and related to marine and coastal environments and to support and safeguard ocean defenders.

In recent decades, seaports have correspondingly witnessed significant expansion, allowing them to play a substantial role in achieving blue growth. This study examines the challenges faced by small-scale fishing actors in gaining access to fishing livelihoods in coastal fishing communities close to Ghanaian ports. Drawing on political ecology, the study demonstrates how securitisation in port areas and dispossession has resulted in unstable fishing livelihoods in port communities. The study shows that the growth-oriented goals of port expansions and port security measures have restricted fishing communities’ access to coastal fishing spaces and caused congestion in the canoe bays of Ghana’s fishing harbours. In addition, the urbanisation around the ports has impacted fishers’ ability to meet the rising cost of living in fishing communities with fishing incomes. Furthermore, the study discusses how the new Jamestown fishing harbour complex project has displaced small-scale fishing actors and become a site of contestation between a coastal fishing community and local government authorities. In conclusion, as coastal fishing actors lose their only source of livelihood, resistance may escalate into different forms of maritime conflicts in the blue economy. The study recommends addressing the marginalisation and exclusion of traditional coastal fishing livelihoods to ensure a more equitable blue economy. © 2023, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,fisheries",10.1007/s40152-023-00302-8,Blue growth;Coastal development;Displacement;Political ecology;Securitisation;Small-scale fishing;Ghana;coastal development;economic growth;fishing community;livelihood;local government;marginalization;maritime trade;political economy;urbanization,,,10.1007/s40152-023-00302-8,DOI(,10.1007/s40152-023-00302-8,DOI(10.1007/s40152-023-00302-8) OR,,,,,

In parallel, researchers have been considering ways to effectively engage stakeholders to support just transformational agendas. Globally, coastal communities are already being affected by the inevitable impacts of climate change and changes to the blue economy. These pressures present complex contexts for coastal zone stakeholder engagement. In this paper, I argue that taking a systems integration approach to interacting with stakeholders is needed to support just transformational change. Assessing stakeholder systems and their relationship to coastal resources is imperative for understanding dynamics that may promote or hinder just transformation. Taking an adaptive management approach to working alongside stakeholders through transitional processes, thus building capacity, is needed to generate momentum toward just transformational change. Lastly, I explain how applications of the subsidiarity principle in integrating stakeholder systems can support a just transformational process and can inform more durable transformational outcomes.

A considerable portion of fish waste is produced in wet markets where bulk of fish products are sold. A comparison of existing practices in different municipalities can indicate the best points of intervention and identify existing traditional practices that can be promoted. This study interviewed stakeholders of the fisheries industry and collected information at the market level to determine existing fish waste management systems. From the responses gathered, the average daily production of fish waste in Philippine wet markets was 70.3 + 0.93 kg, with no significant differences across locations (p = 0.2501). Of the fish waste produced, 32.3 + 1.33 kg per wet market were disposed of, 18.9 + 0.81 kg were sold, and 19.1 + 1.15 kg were given away to stakeholders who re-use the fish waste. A significantly greater proportion of fish waste in rural areas were re-used compared to Metro Manila (p = 0.0311).

Networks of sensors with frequent sampling capabilities are needed to run forecast models, improve navigation, and inform climate research.

In-situ power generation using marine renewable energy sources such as waves and currents can be used to circumvent this constraint. Wave and current resources vary spatially and temporally in the Arctic, with some locations and seasons being better suited for marine renewable energy power generation. Locations and seasons with small resources may still be able to use marine renewable energy because of the low power requirements of the instruments. In this study, we describe the wave and current resources in the Arctic, outline the electricity generation developments that are needed to utilize the resources, and suggest use cases. Wave and current energy converters developed to power observations in the Arctic could also be used to power observations at lower latitudes. Marine renewable energy has the potential to decrease dependence on batteries and improve data collection capabilities in the Arctic; however, this would require the development of new low power technologies that can operate in extreme Arctic environments.

Several constraints and limitations related to plants and plant products means human needs to look beyond green economy. The chemical constituents of animals also allow researchers to evaluate their growth and development. This study evaluates the proximate and chemical compositions of Anadara senilis, Crassostrea gasar, and Mytilus edulis, with emphasizes on their calcium and calcium carbonate contents and industrial importance. A total of 270 live bivalve samples were collected from March to May 2021 from Lagos Lagoon harbour. Each bivalve sample collected was opened to separate the flesh from the species’ shell, sun-dried and transported to the laboratory for analysis. One-way analysis of variance was adopted to estimate the significance level at 5% (P < 0.05). Post-HOC LSD test was performed to verify the disparity of mean. The results of this study revealed that Mytilus edulis shells had the highest moisture, crude protein, and crude fat at 1.15 ± 0.05%, 4.29 ± 0.43%, and 0.96 ± 0.15%, respectively and showed significant difference (P < 0.05). Anadara senilis shells had high levels of calcium (51.00 ± 2.87 mg/kg), magnesium (0.59 ± 0.23 mg/kg) and calcium carbonate (60.91 ± 2.50 mg/kg). Due to the high Ca and CaCO3 contents obtained, these shells can be processed alongside other biomaterials into food supplements, animal feeds, dental products, plant nutrient supplements, ornamental purpose, construction, agricultural industries among others. These would enhance the development of cottage industries, promotes farming of shell animals, help to alleviate the unemployment crisis and creation of wealth from substances which would have been regarded as waste. © 2022, The Author(s).",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1007/s42452-022-05267-7,Circular economy;Exoskeletons;Minerals;Mollusk;Seafood;Shell;Sustainable fisheries;Agriculture;Calcite;Marine biology;Molluscs;Shells (structures);Bivalve shells;Chemical compositions;Crassostrea;Exoskeleton;Mytilus edulis;Sustainable fishery;Calcium carbonate,,,10.1007/s42452-022-05267-7,DOI(,,,,,,,

To facilitate a critical debate about the prospects and pitfalls related to the operationalisation of marine NbS in an EU context, this paper provides an analysis of core definitions, potential categories of marine NBS and a suite of case studies. Coastal waters, shelf and open oceans present multiple options for testing new and scaling up known NbS, which could support both environmental restoration simultaneously with addressing multiple societal challenges, paving the way for a new level of ecosystem-based management. However, as the acceptance of NbS types will depend on ecosystem state and thus history, it will be a significant task to consistently communicate why some solutions may count as a NbS in some areas, while not in others.

This study considers developing collaborative practices in regional planning to help meet regional development objectives. The MSP participants representing the coastal fishery (fishing and fish farming) in the Satakunta region, Finland, exemplify a local stakeholder group. Coastal fishery is a demanding and highly regulated livelihood, with the potential to grow as local food is trending. A mixed-method approach was used to examine MSP participants’ and fishery experts’ perceptions about regional cooperation and the MSP process. The semi-structured interviews focused on three main themes: regional cooperation and synergies, conflicts and threats, and interest in regional collaboration or establishing secondary businesses. Questionnaires 2019 and 2021 examined stakeholders’ engagement (intrinsic motivation) and social trust towards the planners in the MSP process. The need to tackle the challenges of coastal fishery dictates coastal fishery participants’ perceptions regarding the fishery business's development in a regional context. Despite the collaborative approach, the first Finnish MSP round did not make a significant difference in the coastal fishery's status as a stakeholder group. MSP processes and developing the sustainable blue economy are part of the regional development framework, requiring a level playing field and mutual trust among stakeholders.

In this assessment, we look at how to maximize the lake’s benefits through product diversification, value addition, and sustainable use of its fisheries. We show that minimizing post-harvest losses of the silver cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea), locally known as Dagaa, will provide more high-quality fish for human consumption, while significantly increasing fishing earnings. Furthermore, by utilizing biowaste (frames, skin, and fish mouth), revenues from Nile perch could be increased up to thrice. Furthermore, if fishing could target maximum sustainable yield (MSY), landings of Nile perch and Dagaa could increase significantly in the long run. These, combined with investments in other areas such as lacustrine tourism and recreation, as well as fish cage culture, can help the Lake Victoria region’s blue economy expand.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure them, as the accounting methodologies differ between studies, implying divergent results. This article summarizes previous studies by comparing blue economy accounting methodologies and highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Based on the comparison, a new methodology is proposed, based primarily on micro- and country-specific local data; this new methodology has been applied to measure the size of the blue economy in Poland. The results show that previous analyses have slightly underestimated the size of the blue economy in Poland, despite similarities concerning general dynamics and sectoral structure over time. The study concludes that a trade-off exists between using existing one-size-fits-all methods and country-specific methods, with a more precise, tailored approach being achieved at the expense of the accuracy of cross-country comparisons. Finally, the study highlights that, as there is no unambiguous solution to the problem of the above trade-off, different methods should be used with regard to the choice of method depends on the specific research task to be carried out or policy question to be addressed.

To respond to and mitigate these threats, there is a need to first systematically understand and categorise them. This paper reviewed 226 articles from the period 2010–2020 on threats to Australia's oceans and coasts, resulting in the identification of a total of 307 threats. Threats were grouped into three broad categories — threats from use and extraction; environmental and human-induced threats; and policy and socio-political threats —then ranked by frequency. The most common ‘threats from use and extraction’ were recreational activities, non-point source pollution, and urban development; the most common ‘environmental and human-induced threat’ was increased temperatures; and the most common ‘policy and socio-political threat’ was policy gaps and failures (e.g., a lack of coastal climate adaptation policies). The identification of threats across all three categories increased over time; however, the identification of ‘threats from use and extraction’ increased most rapidly over the last four years (2017–2020). Threats were most often described for their impacts on environmental values (68%), followed by economic (14%), socio-cultural (12%), and Indigenous (6%) values. Only 45 of the 226 papers (20%) discussed multiple threats. The threats facing Australia's oceans and coasts are rising, cumulative, and multi-faceted, and the inherent tensions between varied uses, along with intensification of uses that derive short-term anthropogenic benefit, will continue to degrade the ecological sustainability of ocean and coastal systems if actions are not taken. © 2022",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106331,Australia;Blue economy;Blue ribbon;Ecosystem services;Future;Ocean and coastal governance;Oceans and coasts sustainability;Coastal zones;Ecosystems;Extraction;Oceanography;Urban growth;Blue economies;Coastal governances;Cultural value;Ocean and coast sustainability;Ocean governance;Systematic Review;coast;ecosystem service;environmental policy;future prospect;governance approach;human activity;literature review;livelihood;marine ecosystem;mitigation;ocean;sustainability;Sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106331,DOI(,,,,,,,

An effective measurement of a country's blue economy status is necessary. Using traditional economy indicators alone does not fully provide a complete understanding of country's relative position in its trade relationships with others. In this study, the concept of country's blue economy status was transformed into an operational definition through complex network method. Considering the influence of the unavoidable spatial correlations between countries in blue product trade, the double-fixed spatial Durbin model was used to analyze the direct effect of blue product structure on the promotion of country's blue economy status and the spatial spillover effect on surrounding countries. The results showed that: (1) There is a significant spatial correlation between countries' blue economy status, meaning that countries are not randomly independent of each other and are also influenced by other regions. (2) Capacity accumulation, advanced, diversified, and rationalized blue product structure all contribute significantly to the uplift of country's blue economy status, but these four blue product structures differ greatly on the spatial spillover effect of surrounding areas. (3) The results of the heterogeneity analysis based on income level also answer questions in previous studies where consistent conclusions could not be reached due to differences in the subjects studied. This research provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for countries to implement differentiated blue product structure optimization policies based on their stage of blue economy development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1007/s10668-023-03100-8,Blue economy status;Blue product structure;Complex network;Spatial econometric analysis;Spatial spillover effect,,,10.1007/s10668-023-03100-8,DOI(,10.1007/s10668-023-03100-8,DOI(10.1007/s10668-023-03100-8) OR,,,,,

The study was conducted in 2020 using an anonymous online survey following an analytical method based on principles, criteria and indicators. Respondents rated the quality of these initiatives on a Likert scale (1-5) based on 11 indicators. The results show that the Sustainable Ocean Initiative received the highest score, while Marine permaculture scored the lowest. blue economy initiatives were considered inclusive by respondents; however, resources and capacity were deemed insufficient. Respondents from the Global South (developing countries) rated the initiatives higher than those from the Global North (developed countries) perhaps because developing countries are the prime beneficiaries of these programmes and receive more funding and assistance. These findings support policy and decision-makers formulating policies based on stakeholders' opinions and focussing on low-scoring initiatives. The blue economy is a growing sector with high potential for sustainable development; however, various factors, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, are obstructing its advancement.

The exact nature of the blue economy's sustainable ocean development promise, however, remains stubbornly unresolved, with different actors advancing varying, at times conflicting, visions of what sustainable ocean development should look like, how it is to be achieved, and who it is to serve. Tracing the various constructions of blue economy promises over the last decade, this paper contends that the blue economy has progressively retreated from its early commitment to equitable benefit sharing, shifting instead to a deepening preoccupation with economic growth. For small island developing states (SIDS) and coastal least developed countries (LDCs) who took a leading role in embedding equitable benefit sharing within the blue economy during its early popularization, such retreat raises pressing questions over the agenda's continued suitability in advancing desired (and often much needed) sustainable development outcomes. This paper's attempt to grapple with such questions offers a timely contribution to discussions on the blue recovery and ocean-led development avenues in the wake of COVID-19.

However, the required development and transformation of marine systems for farming may have unknown implications for sustainability objectives, such as those outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The aim of this paper is to outline the opportunities for, and threats from, seaweed farming in the context of sustainability. We synthesise the perspectives of expert stakeholders from multiple sectors through a series of Australian workshops to catalogue the pathways through which seaweed farming may affect sustainability, giving specific focus to the SDGs. In doing so, this study illustrates that seaweed farming has the potential to influence, to some degree, the majority of SDGs, with both positive and negative influences. Indeed, seaweed farming is most likely to benefit progress towards achieving SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 12 (Sustainable Production and Consumption), and 15 (Life on Land). But expectations of seaweed farming may also fall short for supporting some goals if appropriate measures are not implemented to mitigate potential impacts, most notably SDG 14 (Life Below Water). We underscore that seaweed farming has the potential to contribute to sustainable development, and that this potential can only be realised with appropriate regulation and mitigation to avoid unwanted negative outcomes. Better identification and management of trade-offs between these potential positive and negative outcomes across sustainability domains, will be critical for realising the full potential of seaweed aquaculture for sustainable development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,agriculture",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133052,Aquaculture;Blue Economy;Nominal group technique;Seaweed;Sustainable development;SWOT analysis;Climate change;Economic and social effects;Economics;Food supply;Planning;Blue economies;Ecosystem degradation;Food security;Large-scales;Marine systems;Nominal group techniques;Seaweed farming;Sustainability objectives;United Nations,,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133052,DOI(,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133052,DOI(10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133052) OR,,,,,

While contracts, rules, policies, and industrial standards have been identified as important for coordinating and aligning inter-firm relationships, tools for the collective, collaborative orchestration of ecosystems have yet to be fully identified and articulated by scholars. The core contribution of this paper, the authors contend, is that corporate foresight tools, as applied at the level of the ecosystem, have the potential to orchestrate ecosystems. To this end, the authors examine the practical use of corporate foresight tools, in this case, roadmapping and scenario planning, as employed by ECOPRODIGI, an Interreg Baltic Sea project designed to advance the EU's strategy for eco-efficient Sustainable Blue Economy in the Roll-on/Roll-off (Ro-Ro) shipping ecosystem. Results demonstrate how ecosystem-level foresight significantly differs from traditional foresight centered around a focal firm. Corporate foresight tools, as applied to an ecosystem: 1) Target a diverse set of ecosystem actors beyond the segment's focal firm, including complementary firms, investors, and non-market actors; 2) Engage ecosystem actors, rather than only the focal firm, in shared strategy development based on a diverse mix of foresight tools; and 3) serve to orient and reify the ecosystem by charting the collective anticipation of innovations, policies, etc., in a shared set of future options. In the end, the authors find that corporate foresight tools operate as constitutive elements of ecosystems, that is, the tools help enact the ecosystem not as an abstract concept but as a shared, lived reality. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Shipping",10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121966,Business ecosystems;Corporate foresight;Focal firm;Maritime;Orchestration;Roadmapping;Scenario planning;Shipping;Atlantic Ocean;Baltic Sea;Economics;Investments;Ships;Baltic sea;Business ecosystem;Corporates;Scenario Planning;Sources of innovation;business development;corporate social responsibility;European Union;maritime trade;maritime transportation;shipping;stakeholder;strategic approach;Ecosystems;Ecosystem,,,10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121966,DOI(,10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121966,DOI(10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121966) OR,,,,,

However, benefits of marine tourism do not typically accrue in small-scale fisheries (SSFs), which often bear the costs of conservation; they accrue to tourists and tourist-focussed businesses. We explored how marine tourism levies could operationalise the beneficiary-pays principle and address these cost-benefit inequities using an online contingent valuation (CV) survey to measure international tourists' willingness-to-pay (WTP) towards community-based shark conservation (N = 1033). Levies were widely supported (96%), with median and Turnbull mean WTP of US$ 10–14.99 and $22.02 per person per day, respectively. We combined these results with data from two marine tourism hotspots in Indonesia – Lombok and Pulau Weh – to explore the feasibility of implementing tourism levies to incentivize pro-conservation behaviour in local SSFs. Our conservative estimates indicate that marine tourism levies in Lombok and Pulau Weh could respectively generate US$ 2.3–10 million and US$ 300,000–1.3 million annually – several times greater than the estimated costs of conservation incentives in local SSFs.

The project would include the creation of 'innovative special economic zones' which would comprise a part of land (the 'Anchor Zone') and of sea (the 'Floating Islands Zone'). To understand how the Floating Island Project was rationalised, it is essential to consider how it was situated in the broader discourse of 'green growth' and 'blue-green economy' by both seasteaders and the French Polynesian government, and how this discourse was used to make the development of innovative special economic zones desirable.

Most studies to date on the economic value of natural resources have thus concentrated on the green economy and how countries could harness its resources to achieve growth and development. However, perhaps the blue economy (i.e., ocean resources) could also help achieve growth and development. Studies on the blue economy are concept notes, reports and literature reviews on the evolving definition of the concept. Therefore, we examine the blue economy in the context of marine communities’ socioeconomic characteristics that could lead to changing patterns in the use of ocean resources. Using household survey data (Ghana Living Standard Survey–GLSS 7) and regression analysis, we investigate the socioeconomic lives and welfare of marine communities amidst blue economy principles. We found that most marine households enjoy a reasonably high standard of living, which bodes well for blue economy principles as livelihood diversification could reduce pressure on fishing as the only job in these communities. However, we also found that many rural coastal communities have more appalling socioeconomic living conditions than their urban counterparts, with poor amenities (like toilet facilities and waste disposal). These are potential threats to the achievement of a blue economy.

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, Life Below Water, highlights the need to balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions when using the World's oceans. However, trade-offs arise between the implementation of SDG goals and the well-being of different groups of people. The use of justice mechanisms is critical for achieving social equity outcomes from ocean use. Trade-offs in implementation between SDG14 and other SDGs in the Seychelles are examined through the lens of distributive and procedural justice. Content analysis of grey and policy literature and qualitative data derived from stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions are used to examine trade-offs between expanding marine protection through the Blue Economy initiative and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP), and the livelihoods and well-being of artisanal fishers. MSP limit fishers’ access to marine resources through spatial, temporal, and permanent prohibitions on access to key fishing areas and gear use that negatively impact upon food security, subsistence livelihoods and well-being. These trade-offs reduce capacity to attain other SDG goals linked to alleviating poverty, hunger and good health and well-being. Consultation processes, by not giving adequate voice to fishers concerns and local knowledge, raise issues of procedural fairness. Trade-offs are largely borne by weaker socio-economic groups, leading to a failure to address issues of distributive fairness.

It is commonly understood to relate to the development of the ocean in a manner which also addresses concerns about ocean health in the face of increasing demands on ocean resources, marine pollution, and climate change. While the blue economy holds potential to act as an integrating policy framework for the sustainable development of the ocean, to date, there are limited examples of implementation in practice to test the usefulness of the concept. Based on a typology of “good governance” adapted from existing global typologies, we investigated the role of blue economy governance in enabling integration. We used a mixed methods approach to explore the experience of Seychelles, a blue economy early adopter, combining policy and institutional analysis, semistructured interviews with key actors and partners, and country fieldwork. Our analysis shows that from its inception, Seychelles' vision of blue economy was a transformative model of development based on the protection and sustainable use of ocean resources for the benefit of Seychellois, consistent with the SDGs. Thanks to early political leadership and international engagement, the adoption of the blue economy concept was successful in raising awareness of the ocean health and its connection to people and the economy, and in establishing the basis of a national blue economy “architecture,” which helped secure innovative finance for implementation. Transitioning to implementation, several governance challenges emerged, which included maintaining high-level political momentum, stakeholder engagement, and institutional coordination and capacity. While some governance barriers to effective integration may be unique to Seychelles, some are common to SIDS, and others are found in a range of governance settings. Seychelles international visibility has brought high expectations, not always commensurate with local aspirations, capabilities, and jurisdictional responsibilities. Bridging the gap between global expectations and local realities will require support for locally driven institutional reforms, which take account of issues of scale, culture, and capacity.

The body shape was assessed with geometric morphometrics, while shape indices and elliptic Fourier analysis were used to evaluate the shape of the sagitta otoliths. The data were analysed using multivariate and univariate analysis of variance, discriminant function and principal component analysis. The anchovy population could be divided into five distinct stocks based on body shape, with an overall leave-one-out cross-validated correct classification of 85.6%. The geometric morphometrics revealed significant differences in body depth, snout, lower jaw and caudal fin. The differences in sagitta otolith shape also revealed the existence of four distinct stocks with an overall leave-one-out cross-validated correct classification of 46.5%–69.3%. The elliptic Fourier analysis revealed two main stocks of anchovy from the Black Sea as the Eastern–Middle Black Sea stock and the Western Black Sea stock. Based on the elliptic Fourier analysis, the differences in the sagitta otoliths increase in magnitude with increasing geographic separation, first manifested at the otolith anterior notch, followed by changes in the otolith width.

They typically focus on addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many of these projects (e.g. Commercialization and Innovation Actions) have an ambitious challenge to ensure that partners share core competencies to simultaneously achieve technological and commercial success and sustainability after the end of the EC funds. To achieve this ambitious challenge, Horizon projects must have a proper governance model and a systematized process that can manage the existing paradoxical tensions involving numerous European partners and their respective agendas and stakeholders. This article presents the VCW-Value Creation Wheel (Lages in J Bus Res 69: 4849–4855, 2016), as a framework that has its roots back in 1995 and has been used since 2015 in the context of numerous Space Business, Earth Observation, and European Community (EC) projects, to address complex problems and paradoxical tensions. In this article, we discuss six of these paradoxical tensions that large Horizon Consortia face in commercialization, namely when managing innovation ecosystems, co-creating, taking digitalization, decision-making, tech-transfer, and sustainability actions. We discuss and evaluate how alliance partners could find the optimal balance between (1) cooperation, competition, and coopetition perspectives; (2) financial, environmental, and social value creation; (3) tech-push and market-pull orientations; (4) global and local market solutions; (5) functionality driven and human-centered design (UX/UI); (6) centralized and decentralized online store approaches. We discuss these challenges within the case of the EC H2020 NextLand project answering the call for greening the economy in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We analyze NextLand Online Store, and its Business and Innovation Ecosystem while considering the input of its different stakeholders, such as NextLand’s commercial team, service providers, users, advisors, EC referees, and internal and external stakeholders. Preliminary insights from a twin project in the field of Blue Economy (EC H2020 NextOcean), are also used to support our arguments. Partners, referees, and EC officers should address the tensions mentioned in this article during the referee and approval processes in the pre-grant and post-grant agreement stages. Moreover, we propose using the Value Creation Wheel (VCW) method and the VCW meta-framework as a systematized process that allows us to co-create and manage the innovation ecosystem while engaging all the stakeholders and presenting solutions to address these tensions.

However, P-recovery from ash involves removing metals, which need to be disposed of carefully, as does the brine collected. If cations in the ash and anions in the brine could be combined in order to produce coagulants/flocculants, a new circular model would be established. A preliminary experiment for this purpose has demonstrated that a liquid poly‑aluminum chloride (PAC) could be synthesized from the aluminum ion/Al3+ removed from the ash and the original brine. With this work, we synthesized the liquid PAC by a hydrothermal method, and the results from infrared spectrometer demonstrated that the synthesized PAC was similar to a commercial PAC. Moreover, the synthesized PAC was able to efficiently reduce the effluent turbidity of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), especially when compared with the commercial PAC. It is therefore important that research in this area be continued in order to improve the quality of synthesized coagulants and to produce different coagulants based on cations and anions in ash and brine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Others,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157344,Brine;Coagulants;Desalination;Phosphorus recovery;Removing metals;Sludge incineration;Coal Ash;Incineration;Salts;Sewage;Water Purification;Aluminum chloride;Chemicals removal (water treatment);Coagulation;Effluent treatment;Effluents;Metal recovery;Phosphorus;Positive ions;Sludge disposal;Wastewater disposal;Wastewater reclamation;Wastewater treatment;aluminum;aluminum chloride;anion;cation;coagulating agent;poly aluminum chloride;unclassified drug;brine;inorganic salt;Coagulant;Fresh Water;Poly(aluminum chloride);Removing metal;Resource recovery;Seawater desalination;Synthesised;Waste activated sludges;coagulation;desalination;phosphorus;pollutant removal;removal experiment;seawater;sludge;Article;ash;environmental impact;environmental management;infrared spectroscopy;preliminary data;quality control;synthesis;thermal analysis;turbidity;waste water treatment plant;fly ash;incineration;procedures;sewage;water management,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157344,DOI(,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157344,DOI(10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157344) OR,,,,,

To describe historical and current trends, we examined fisheries statistics from governmental and non-governmental agencies, sportfishing clubs’ reports, diaries of sportfishing captains, and the catch and effort databases of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. We highlight two key points. First, billfish fisheries in the Western Indian Ocean are highly diverse, comprising two distinct segments—coastal and oceanic. However, data are poor for most countries with significant gaps in information especially for sport and artisanal fisheries. Second, the evidence assembled showed that billfish species have immense social, cultural, and economic value. Swordfish are targeted by both large-scale and semi-industrial fisheries, while other billfish species, particularly marlin, are highly sought after by sport fisheries in most countries.

The ethics of the blue economy is highly complex, a result of covering an ever-increasing multitude of overlapping activities, some with long supply chains and many with significant social, economic and ecological impacts, occurring in dynamic environments often hidden from the view of communities and regulators, and by industries expanding rapidly in scale and technology. In unpacking this complexity, this chapters consider the types of (governing) values that the blue economy should aim to achieve, including both humanist and ecocentric values, and with a particular focus on sustainable development and finance. It also explores the types of (governance) values that the blue economy should employ as it pursues these larger values. It further examines how the ideas of institutional integrity and multidimensional legitimacy can help the blue economy garner stakeholder and community support. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1515/9783110733488-023,Blue economy;COVID-19;Eco-centrism;Ethics;Institutional integrity;Multidimensional legitimacy;Sustainable development,,,10.1515/9783110733488-023,DOI(,10.1515/9783110733488-023,DOI(10.1515/9783110733488-023) OR,,,,,

Specifically, it predicts the adoption rate of improved seaweed farming techniques among farmers. Secondly, it analyses factors affecting the adoption of learned farming techniques. Finally, sensitivity analysis to examine the magnitude to which identified factors could affect the adoption rate. The study adopted cross section design to draw a sample of 233 respondents. A survey, a series for Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and Key Informant Interviews (KII) and ADOPT were applied for data collection and analysis respectively. The results revealed that learned seaweed farming techniques are likely to be adopted by 28% of the farmers after 13 years provided the current farming status remains the same. Based on sensitivity analysis, adoption of learned farming techniques may reach to 50% or decline to about 11% within 13 years. Profit and productivity orientation by farmers, local community benefit orientation, seaweed production scale, relative upfront cost/investment costs, profit and productivity benefit in the first year of use, community costs and benefit, risk and ease and convenience are potential factors for learned techniques uptake. It is concluded that, seaweed training programme is potential and there is high likelihood of adoption and hence improved income among farmers.

The triple bottom line goals of economic development, social equity, and environmental conservation are at the center of the blue economy vision. Yet the ambiguities surrounding the term have resulted in considerable variation in how the blue economy is implemented and what is prioritized. This paper takes a global snapshot of current approaches to national level blue economy governance. In doing so this paper provides the first global assessment of blue economy implementation approaches, through the development of a global blue economy database. Using the best available information from policy documents, media releases and other publicly available online information, we comparatively analyzed each country’s governance strategy to assess the level of blue economy development in coastal states around the world. Throughout this paper we outline the novel methodological approach we took in order to develop a tool for analyzing national level blue economy implementation on the global scale. This approach will allow for ongoing and continued analysis of blue economy operationalization as the concept continues to evolve.

The socioeconomic status index (SEI) incorporated 6 dimensions: access to fresh fish, access to market, available fish processing (drying) infrastructure, favourable price range, high quantity range traded, and high seasonal profit margins; using three major commercial fishes (Nile perch, Tilapia and Dagaa) and the season (pre and post COVID-19) as the main independent variables.

The socioeconomic quantification was highly dependent on COVID-19 containment periods that reflected very high (pre COVID-19 = 4.67, post COVID-19 = 4.06) impacts on small-scale inland fisheries. This suggested a negative impact of COVID-19 on small-scale inland fisheries attributed to various factors such as disrupted value chains, reduced purchasing power among the customers, struggles by businesses to compensate for losses incurred during the pandemic, and diversion of economic focus. The impact had a lower proportion on Dagaa, given its low value compared to the other two major commercial species.

In this article, we outline the experiences, perspectives, and narratives of the small-scale fishing actors in Ghana. Drawing on qualitative interview data, we examine the relationship between small-scale and industrial fisheries in Ghana using political ecology and sustainable livelihood approaches. We demonstrate how industrialised, capital-intensive fishing has disrupted the economic and social organisation of local fishing communities, affecting incomes, causing conflicts, social exclusion and disconnection, and compromising the social identity of women. These cumulative impacts and disruptions in Ghana's coastal communities have threatened the viability of small-scale fisheries, yet coastal fishing actors have few capabilities to adapt.

The lack of appropriate management protocols for this residual biomass leaves it mostly unmanaged or disposed of in landfills. Such inappropriate solutions lead to negative environmental impacts, health concerns and coastal degradation, representing an opportunity to develop the bioeconomy. Although a relevant number of studies exists on the use of edible marine macroalgae for several purposes, there is generally a lack of information concerning MMW valorisation, at both local and global scales. This review thus explores the ecological and biotechnological potential for the establishment of a new approach for MMW valorisation based in the circular and blue economies. It is supported in literature on the use of residual biomass whenever possible and also includes studies with fresh biomass to extrapolate, considering known characteristics of MMW; consequently, a roadmap for its utilisation is provided. The review includes characteristics of various seaweeds, MMW accumulation worldwide and traditional uses, together with the development of alternative and integrated valorisation strategies. By analysing a large number of studies, it was possible to perceive a clear potential to explore MMW to obtain renewable fuels, especially biogas and bioethanol and for use in agricultural activities.

With the emerging concepts of “Blue Economy” and “Blue Biotechnology”, marine microalgae can be employed to achieve sustainability in numerous industries. Nonetheless, microalgae-based production processes are still not considered economically feasible owing to the high costs associated with cultivation and biomass processing. To mitigate the costs associated with the production process, the concept of marine microalgae-based biorefining has emerged where a single feedstock is employed to produce several distinct bioproducts, each with commercial value. Marine microalgae-based biorefineries could be made economically feasible by incorporating both high-value and low-value bio-compounds in the production line, whereas utilization of wastewater and flue gases as alternative nutrient sources for the cultivation can make the process more sustainable. Nonetheless, several challenges are associated with marine microalgae-based biorefinery, which necessitate the attention of future researchers to make this concept a reality. Hence, the present review provides a comprehensive discussion on the biorefinery of marine microalgae in view of producing diverse metabolites using a single feedstock while providing valuable insight into the directions of future research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,agriculture",10.1016/j.bej.2022.108593,Biofuels;Biorefining;High-value compounds;Marine microalgae;Waste remediation;Algae;Bioconversion;Biopolymers;Feedstocks;Metabolites;Microorganisms;Refining;astaxanthin;beta carotene;biodiesel;bioethanol;biofuel;biogas;chrysolaminarin;fertilizer;fucoxanthin;plastic;polysaccharide;polyunsaturated fatty acid;protein;unclassified drug;xanthophyll;Animal feed;Bioproducts;Biorefineries;High-value compound;Multi-products;Nutraceuticals;Production process;algal cell culture;algal growth;animal food;Article;biofuel production;bioremediation;biotechnological production;economic aspect;flue gas;genetic engineering;marine alga;metabolite;microalga;nonhuman;nutrient;recycling;waste water management;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.bej.2022.108593,DOI(,10.1016/j.bej.2022.108593,DOI(10.1016/j.bej.2022.108593) OR,,,,,

This is juxtaposed against India's ambitious blue economy targets and policy thrust that pin on the expansion of mariculture as a promising avenue for enhancing marine fish production. Farm-level, region-specific, techno-economic, and socio-cultural factors associated with, and conditional on, sustainable intensification of mariculture-based production systems are examined in detail. The Principles-Criteria-Indicators (PCI) approach is used to establish the linkage between identified farm-level indicators and various dimensions of sustainability. While the selected enterprises were assessed to be technically and economically viable in general, glaring gaps were evident on key indicators of sustainability such as the legitimacy of access over water bodies, use of quality seed and feed, institutional credit access, market access, and fair marketing practices, optimal stocking density, mechanization, use of renewable energy, adoption of environmental-friendly culture practices, farm surveillance, crew safety, and social protection. This indicates the need for taking proactive measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of mariculture, particularly in the initial stages of establishment when such interventions are easy to adopt. Based on the insights obtained from the analysis, a broad set of strategies, policy options, and institutional interventions critical to scaling-up coastal mariculture enterprises along the east and west coasts of India are presented.

The development of small-scale commercial fishing is primarily driven by transnational fisheries trade and depends on dive fisher labour force facing issues with deficits in decent work, health and safety, and safety at sea provisions. Given the macro-policy priorities for decent work in the transition of small island developing states (SIDS) to blue economy, this paper examines the development interventions in small-scale commercial fisheries trade that have exacerbated unsafe marine working conditions of dive fishers. Despite significant investments in developing commercial fisheries trade, the mismatch between macro-level decisions and micro-level labour needs has hardly been explored via the blue economy and sustainable development goal interlinkages. This study used a qualitative research approach to examine the unsafe working conditions of dive fishers and examined why dive-related accidents and fatalities occur in commercial fisheries in the first place. A systematic approach in the analysis of diving accidents helps the study to, firstly, highlight the gaps between macro policy and practice at the national and global levels. Secondly, the approach helps explore the need for a coherent approach to policy integration that bridges the gap between the macro and operational levels of small-scale fisheries labour force. The study analyses the International Labour Organization’s decent work instruments with SIDS sustainable development priorities for fisheries workforce and points out that governments must be responsible at the macro level for managing accidents at sea and building a safe diving workforce through competent marine and diving authorities.

With few exceptions, the status quo does not meet the diverse development aspirations of coastal communities or ensure healthy oceans for current and future generations. The blue economy is expected to grow to USD2.5–3 trillion by 2030, and there is particular interest in its potential to alleviate poverty in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, and to support a blue recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a selective, thematic review of the blue economy literature to examine: (i) the opportunities and risks for coastal communities, (ii) the barriers and enablers that shape community engagement, and (iii) the strategies employed by communities and supporting organizations, which can be strengthened to deliver a ‘sustainable' blue economy and improve social justice for coastal communities. Our review finds that under business-as-usual and blue growth, industrial fisheries, large-scale aquaculture, land reclamation, mining, and oil and gas raise red flags for communities and marine ecosystems. Whereas, if managed sustainably, small-scale fisheries, coastal aquaculture, seaweed farming and eco-tourism are the most likely to deliver benefits to communities. Yet, these are also the sectors most vulnerable to negative and cumulative impacts from other sectors. Based on our evaluation of enablers, barriers and strategies, the paper argues that putting coastal communities at the center of a clear vision for an inclusive Sustainable Blue Economy and co-developing a shared and accessible language for communities, practitioners and policy-makers is essential for a more equitable ocean economy, alongside mainstreaming social justice principles and integrated governance that can bridge different scales of action and opportunity.

China is one of the countries with the most resources of blue carbon, with carbon sequestration of 0.835 Tg C/a. To develop blue economy and facilitate the fulfillment of carbon neutrality, it is of great significance for China to build the blue carbon trading market (BCTM). This paper aimed to improve the participation probability of stakeholders to construct an effective BCTM through evolutionary game theory. First, we constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model including the governments, the suppliers of blue carbon (SBC) and the demanders of blue carbon (DBC), based on the corresponding cost and benefit in BCTM. To further reveal the factors affecting the cooperation of above parties, we analyzed the sensitivity of the stakeholders through five parameters, i.e., proportion of subsidies, unit carbon tax, blue carbon credits, unit price of blue carbon credits, and the cost of carbon emission reduction unit. To verify the game model, a case study of blue carbon credits of mangrove trading was performed. The main conclusions are as follows. In the initial stage of BCTM, the governments need to play a leading role in regulating and incentivizing motivation of the SBC and DBC. Subsidies and carbon taxes are conducive to promoting BCTM to develop into the middle stage. In the middle stage, price and quota of BC credits are two primary parameters to affect the evolutionary results of above three groups. Thus, it's necessary for the governments to adjust these parameters in time. When the trading scale and operation mode of BCTM approaching stable, the market will enter into the mature stage. Then, the governments can reduce subsidies to save fiscal expenditure and lessen the intervention, so as to gradually withdraw from the market. The above conclusions can provide a theoretical basis and reference for the construction of efficient BCTM and promote the integration of blue carbon into the carbon market in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Blue carbon",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132867,Blue carbon;Carbon trading market;Evolutionary game theory;Stakeholder;Emission control;Game theory;Blue economies;Carbon credits;Carbon neutralities;Carbon sequestration;Carbon taxes;Carbon trading;Carbon;China,,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132867,DOI(,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132867,DOI(10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132867) OR,,,,,

In Ghana, the Marine Pollution Act 2016 (Act, 932) was promulgated to prevent, regulate and control pollution within Ghana’s territorial waters. Meanwhile, the health of Ghana’s oceans keeps deteriorating. This paper aims to develop an integrative model to enhance BEI through Sustainable Supply Chain Performance (SSCP) by integrating competing theories to attract sustainable investment to conserve and make sustainable use of marine resources. We anchored our study on quantitative research approach and a cross-sectional survey data. Our hypotheses have been tested using variance-based Structural Equation Modeling and SMART-PLS version 3.3.1. The study has revealed that organisational factors, technological factors, supply chain risk, green environmental awareness, perceived cost and regulatory environment are significant determinants of BEI. Moreover, BEI significantly drives SSCP. Again, BEI significantly mediates the relation between its determinants and SSCP.

Blue bonds seek to deliver both positive environmental and/or social impact alongside a financial return on investment to investors. However, there has been limited academic scrutiny of these early initiatives to evaluate whether this rhetoric is justified. This article leverages 15-years of scholarship on green bonds to develop an analytical framework that is applied to five of the world's first blue bonds. A comprehensive content analysis of sources such as blue bond project documents and secondary interviews is used to synthesise their characteristics, and consider trends related to their thematic scope, geographical scope, environmental impacts, and financial returns. Thematically, blue bond proceeds are channelled towards projects aligned with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 ‘Life Below Water’, the Blue Economy, and policy discourse around the ‘blue recovery’ from covid-19. These projects range from marine protected area (MPA) creation, to improved fisheries management, and potentially, oil and gas exploration. However, greater explanation of the logic through which project activities are expected to deliver impact and returns is warranted. Equally, impact measurement is often underwhelming, with many bonds targeting easy-to-measure outputs (e.g., area conserved) rather than outcomes and impacts (e.g., increases in fish abundance).

Today, regional initiatives for classifying sustainable activities exist, and several decades' research and development of ecosystem services and natural capital have identified and tested alternative economic models. The World Bank has the potential to finance them and sustainability at the landscape scale is achievable. But economic and environmental values can come into conflict. In developing countries, sustainable alternatives exist in business activities such as coastal and marine tourism. Financing small businesses through sound digital infrastructure is critical, as is the use of public fiscal instruments for the sustainable use of natural resources. Despite its developed status, renewable energy policies in the EU are leading to forest destruction. Financial vehicles such as green bonds have a similar potential. To avoid greenwashing, more focus needs to be on meeting the needs of those at the base of the economic pyramid, resourcing them with smart technologies and valuing civic engagement. Climate finance must be ethical and its allocation have integrity; this will foster community resilience. To avoid repeating the mistakes of terrestrial development, the world's oceans need to be protected and new business models adopted in this expanding frontier.

In addition, the search for outdoor experiences after the COVID-19 lockdown suspensions has renewed the popularity of nautical tourism in this area and in the world. Despite the negative effects of the economic crisis on tourism, evidence suggests that some tourist destinations in the Atlantic area are resilient. Thus, whereas some branches of the blue economy face considerable challenges to increasing competitiveness, others offer opportunities for economic growth and employment. In this context, investment is necessary to lay the foundations for the sustainable development of nautical tourism. However, regarding the role of investment in productivity and competitiveness in the context of crisis, there is no consensus among academics. Thus, we investigate whether the investment contributed to competitiveness in nautical tourism in the Atlantic Area in 2016–2020. We collected data from ORBIS for 29 nautical-tourism companies and performed a quantitative and qualitative narrative analysis of competitiveness indicators, enabling comparisons pre and during crisis. The results highlight the multiplicity of ways in which crisis impacts nautical-tourism firms. The research fills a gap in the literature by investigating the dynamic capabilities of nautical-tourism SMEs in periods of recession, with a special focus on restructuring and competitiveness strategies. Some recommendations are outlined to promote the efficiency of resources and stimulate the competitiveness of companies to allow the regional development of nautical tourism in the territory of the Atlantic area. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,tourism",10.3390/w14192964,Atlantic Area;blue economy;competitiveness;corporate performance;investment;nautical tourism;Atlantic Ocean;Competition;Regional planning;Tourism;Atlantic area;Blue economies;Competitiveness;Corporate performance;Economic crisis;Economic growths;Is investments;Nautical tourism;Productivity and competitiveness;Tourist destinations;COVID-19;economic growth;Investments,,,10.3390/w14192964,DOI(,10.3390/w14192964,DOI(10.3390/w14192964) OR,,,,,

Although the insights of agrarian political economy have been deployed fruitfully to analyse land grabs in Africa, similar efforts are rare when it comes to ocean grabs. With reference to the new development thinking on the ocean economy—or ‘blue economy’—as the new frontier of resource-based industrialization in Africa, we re-frame the agrarian question and apply it to the offshore petroleum industry, expanding agrarian political-economic theory of industrialization beyond its traditional confines of land and agriculture. Our paper makes two main theoretical contributions. First, it contributes to efforts in agrarian political economy to incorporate the ocean and fisheries.

Unfortunately, today biological and chemical pollution of the oceans and marine waters is widespread and has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, which are exacerbated by global climate changes. In addition, such impacts on fisheries and aquaculture are significant in inducing socio-economic losses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop innovative solutions to improve productivity and environmental performance in line with the blue sustainable economy (European Green Deal). However, one upcoming problem associated with shellfish consumption is shell waste and its disposal. In addition, the percentage of wasted shells destined for reuse is much lower than the one accumulated in landfills or in more or less well-managed sites. This represents a weakness of the shellfish farming sector that can only be mitigated through a project of shellfish waste recycling moving towards the circular economy, with undoubted environmental and economic advantages.

Reducing fisheries' impacts on marine megafauna is particularly challenging in small-scale fisheries (SSFs), where endangered species can have important consumptive use values. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have been proposed as a potential solution, but there is a lack of empirical data on if and how they might work in this context. We present a novel combination of methods – scenario interviews with contingent valuation (CV) – for exploring and designing locally-appropriate PES schemes; and apply these methods to investigate how different types of incentives might influence fisher behaviour and mortality of Critically Endangered taxa in two case study SSFs in Indonesia. Fishers almost unanimously supported positive conditional incentives: 98 % and 96 % of fishers would stop landing hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.) and wedgefish (Rhynchobatus spp.), respectively, in contrast to 1 % and 6 % under a business-as-usual scenario, and 52 % and 46 % in response to a negative incentive (fine). CV results showed that an incentive-based scheme for catch mitigation of all hammerheads and wedgefish across both sites could cost US$71,408–235,927 annually, and save up to 18,500 and 2140 individuals, respectively. This study provides empirical evidence that PES could offer a cost-effective and socially-just approach for marine conservation in SSFs; and offers a scalable method for designing locally-appropriate investment-ready schemes, which could support the delivery of societal goals such as net positive outcomes for marine biodiversity and a sustainable and equitable blue economy. © 2022 The Author(s)","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109821,Behaviour change;Contingent valuation;Endangered species;Marine megafauna;Payments for ecosystem services;Scenarios;Indonesia;behavioral response;conservation status;contingent valuation;ecosystem service;endangered species;incentive;shark;Motivation,,,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109821,DOI(,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109821,DOI(10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109821) OR,,,,,

We suggest a shift in practice of social licence to operate such that consent is granted by Indigenous groups based on their perspective of social licence at all stages of the project life-cycle and at each interface where new social and cultural risks and opportunities emerge. Such a shift in practice across the Blue Economy requires the consideration of multiple collaborative arrangements and a platform for Indigenous driven transformation in how Indigenous Peoples participate in Blue Economy sectors and in business agreements based on their particular historical, social, cultural and economic context and goals.

However, centennial-scale upwelling variability and its associated forcing mechanisms are poorly understood, primarily due to the lack of high-resolution upwelling records beyond the instrumental and historical periods. Here we reconstruct monsoon-induced upwelling variations over the past 7000 years, based on a high-resolution (∼30 yr) δ15N record from the upwelling zone off the east coast of Hainan Island. δ13C, δ15N, C/N, TOC and biogenic opal are determined to verify the dominant source of marine organic matter in the GH6 core, and δ15N values are used to indicate the variations in nitrate utilization by phytoplankton. The results show distinct centennial-scale variability, which is generally synchronous with solar activity, latitudinal shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) frequency. We conclude that the centennial-scale upwelling intensity was predominately induced by external solar forcing, with internal feedback such as latitudinal shifts of the ITCZ and ENSO variability as a mediator amplifying the solar variation signal. Our new findings indicate that external forcing mechanisms exerted a significant influence on upwelling variations before the Anthropocene and should be considered when producing future projections of upwelling changes at low latitudes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.104021,Centennial timescales;Coastal upwelling;Hainan Island;Nitrogen isotope;Solar activity;Hainan;Pacific Ocean;South China Sea;Atmospheric pressure;Climatology;Solar energy;Solar radiation;Centennial timescale;External forcing;Hainan island;High resolution;Intertropical convergence zone;Nitrogen isotopes;Northern South China Sea;Solar: activity;Time-scales;Holocene;nitrogen isotope;organic matter;solar activity;upwelling;Nitrogen;China,,,10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.104021,DOI(,,,,,,,

UCH management requires a decision support system to prioritize UCH interventions and actions for long-term preservation. This paper presents a novel UCH risk assessment methodology to quantitatively assess the impact of wave-induced hazards on UCH in coastal environments at a local level and the screening of UCH sites at risk. The UCH risk is calculated as a function of vulnerability (depending on archaeological materials, slope, and seabed type), hazard (decontextualization, scouring, and erosive wear), and exposure computed for the UCH sites registered in an archaeological database. The procedure was validated at two shipwreck sites, Bucentaure and Fougueux, in the Bay of Cadiz. An agreement between the risk index value and the in situ measurements of the rates of scouring and corrosion (used as a proxy of erosive wear) was observed. The methodology was tested in the Bay of Cadiz using an archaeological database containing 56 UCH sites. It allowed identifying the UCH sites at high risk: six are at risk of decontextualization, four are in peril of scouring erosion, and two are at risk of erosive wear. Two UCH sites at high risk of at least two hazards were also identified. This UCH risk assessment methodology is a stepping stone towards a decision support system that will give priority to research, prospection, management, and protection measures in the UCH sites analyzed to ensure their preservation in a context of climate change in the era of a sustainable blue economy.

Seaweeds, however, are also important drivers in the development of the blue bioeconomy due to their vast diversity of unique chemicals with a broad range of industrial and biotechnological applications. In tropical regions, seaweed production has been focused on a few species only, because of their hydrocolloids used in the food industry. There is a strong need to identify new applications of red seaweed species in other sectors such as aquaculture. Therefore, to diversify the culture of red seaweeds, more tropical species need to be investigated for their chemical composition and potential application in aquaculture, and then, to develop a method for a sustainable cultivation of new seaweed candidates and enhance their economic potential. Based on this context, we analyze the potential value of the red edible seaweed Acanthophora spp., an under-valued seaweed species which is naturally abundant in tropical countries, and Kappaphycus spp., a commercially valuable seaweed commonly used for polysaccharide extraction. The vast chemical diversity of seaweeds (polysaccharides, phytohormones, amino acids, and pigments) has led to research on a wide range of applications in aquaculture, including pathogen control, immunostimulant, antioxidant, bioremediation, feed, UV protectants, increase in seafood shelf life, animal colorant, and growth regulator for microalga culture. This review hopes to stimulate the interest among seaweed researchers to investigate other local seaweed species and seek greater added value of their biomass and chemical compounds and their applications in the aquaculture sector. Additionally, this information will help stakeholders to benefit from these two red seaweeds by contributing to the diversification of the blue bioeconomy in tropical countries.

Maritime cultural heritage (MCH) is often overlooked within the MSP framework since it is not often readily defined within a given space and, therefore, not mapped. However, MCH holds particular value for regional communities, representing their history and legacy. In addition, MCH offers ideal opportunities for the development of local/regional blue economy initiatives (e.g., sustainable tourism). Therefore, the successful development and implementation of MSP processes requires the active engagement of local communities and the consideration of their MCH. In the light of the process developed in Estonia, we assessed how cultural heritage and in particular, its intangible form, can be integrated into MSP. Stakeholder engagement was used to conduct cultural mapping and knowledge co-production which resulted in ‘county portraits’, a unique approach to strengthen the potential of MCH and dependent human activities and to promote its future consideration in MSP process. The findings demonstrate that the EU Directive on MSP offers opportunities for coastal EU Member States to customize their MSP and use innovative solutions for the explicit incorporation of the MCH.

The current study fills this gap by synthesizing the environmental and socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global ocean by conducting a systemic scoping review of 92 published articles. From a geospatial perspective, the studies covered a total of 37 countries, mainly from Asia, Europe, and North America, with a particular focus on the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. From an environmental perspective, both positive and negative effects on global oceans were summarized. Notably, improved coastal water quality and reduced underwater noise were reported. On the other hand, the increasing COVID-19-related medical waste such as personal protective equipment leads to severe pollution, which threatens the marine ecosystem and wildlife. From a socioeconomic perspective, the impacts of the pandemic were negative throughout with marine tourism and the fishery industry being severely disrupted.

Among these technologies, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-extensively used in terrestrial networks- is being considered because of its high spectral efficiency, low inter-symbol interference and fading, and low sensitivity to time synchronization errors. In this paper, we investigate how OFDM physical layers affect protocol design and performance at higher layers of the protocol stack. Particularly, we present a Reservation-based Adaptive MAC (RAMAC) protocol that leverages the capabilities of OFDM physical layers. Using information about channel conditions, RAMAC selects the OFDM frequencies to use on a per-packet basis. We evaluate the performance of RAMAC via DESERT-based simulations on a variety of underwater scenarios with models of real OFDM-enabled underwater acoustic modems.

The scope for Blue Economy to form a core ""cog"" in our low-carbon future is obvious, from the potential for renewable energy production and coastal resilience building to possibilities for sustainable food production and the delivery of economic opportunities for peripheral communities. However, fundamental questions remain on how to meaningfully deliver these promises, such as how to avoid embedding a model of damaging extractivism, as per the terrestrial economy, and how to deliver on the key social sustainability principles of human well-being, equity, and justice when planning and developing blue economies.

These so-called ocean-based climate “solutions” often fall under the umbrella of the “blue economy,” a term used to refer to new ways of organizing ocean economies to provide equitable economic and environmental benefits. Yet, thus far the literature exploring blue economies and blue economy governance has largely overlooked or downplayed its equity and justice roots and implications, including how blue economies are embedded in multiple scales of environmental injustices. This is particularly important when blue economies include offshore oil production. The purpose of this paper is to both emphasize the need and provide an approach to incorporate justice and equity—specifically climate justice—into blue economy planning and scholarship. We build on conceptualizations of blue economies as assemblages to draw attention to the global reach of climate impacts associated with oil that are often overlooked or ignored at sites of production and through regional governance. We argue that greenhouse gas emissions from the life cycle of oil should be included in policies and planning (including blue economy planning) at sites of production, but that this must also incorporate underlying power structures that lead to uneven impacts and climate injustice. We look at environmental assessments as a regional governance tool that could be used to shape opportunities and openings to organize blue economies differently. To illustrate these points, we look at how environmental assessments are playing (and could play) a role in enacting and shaping Newfoundland and Labrador's blue economy. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Oil and gas",10.1016/j.polgeo.2022.102670,Blue economy;Blue justice;Climate justice;Environmental assessment;Newfoundland and Labrador;Ocean equity;Offshore oil;Sustainability;Canada;climate effect;conceptual framework;environmental assessment;environmental justice;equity;greenhouse gas;marine environment;oil production;sustainability,,,10.1016/j.polgeo.2022.102670,DOI(,10.1016/j.polgeo.2022.102670,DOI(10.1016/j.polgeo.2022.102670) OR,,,,,

Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is commonly used in decision-making to guide spatially efficient protected area expansion. Here we contend that SCP can also be used to streamline MSP negotiations by developing a coherent, integrated portfolio of sites for multiple sectors that depend on biodiversity being maintained in a good state, as a counterpoint to spatial priorities for those commercial and industrial activities that have negative environmental impacts. We demonstrate this in Algoa Bay, South Africa, given the social-ecological complexity of the bay, and its central location in the first national MSP process. In anticipation of this national process, a civil-society-led Community of Practice was established with a core team to lead stakeholder engagement, data acquisition and management, and SCP analyses. More than 500 stakeholders participated in the project and many contributed spatial data or engaged in expert-based participatory mapping. Spatial products were supplemented with existing, published datasets. Altogether, conservation targets were set for 115 biodiversity features and 22 nature-based activities, with the cost layer built from data on 10 commercial and industrial activities, cumulative pressures (n = 31) on ecosystems, and planning-unit area. All targets were met in 15% of the study area, of which only a third (4%) was outside of marine protected areas, demonstrating that it is possible to align multi-sector priorities for intact biodiversity. This approach can be widely applied in MSP to support sustainable ocean economies. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109574,Participatory mapping;Social-ecological systems;Spatial prioritization;Stakeholder engagement;Sustainable use;Algoa Bay;Eastern Cape;South Africa;biodiversity;conservation planning;data acquisition;marine environment;protected area;spatial data;spatial planning;stakeholder;Military Personnel;Levonorgestrel,,,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109574,DOI(,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109574,DOI(10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109574) OR,,,,,

The production of hydrocolloids and bio stimulants for agriculture has been the main product portfolio for the last several decades. Nevertheless, with 7516.6 km of coastline, this sector holds enormous promise for sustainable economic development. The strong “Innovation Quotient” proved to be the crucial driving force to develop several novel products backed up with intellectual property rights. Appreciable steps have been taken by the Union Government of India to give further fillip to the marine sector through different forums to achieve a sustainable and circular Blue Economy. The purpose of this thematic article is to collate the state-of-the-art information on the cultivation and processing sector in the country, and to provide recommendations for evidence-based sector management and policy decision making. The proposal of establishing a “Multipurpose Seaweed Park”—the first of its kind in the world—in Tamil Nadu is a very pertinent first step towards the cause of modernizing and improving the domestic industries, adopting improved processing and sustainable and green technologies. The analysis revealed that in order to fulfill these objectives, more coordinated efforts of several stakeholders are necessary, along with the cooperation of different government departments and industry participation.

We undertook a meta-analysis of 46 studies to compare the effects of different material types (natural or eco-friendly vs. artificial) on the colonising biota on built structures. Neither the abundance nor richness of colonists displayed consistent patterns of difference between artificial and natural substrates or between eco-friendly and standard concrete. Instead, there were differences in the abundance of organisms (but not richness) between artificial and natural materials, that varied according to material type and by functional group. When compared to biogenic materials and rock, polymer and metal supported significantly lower abundances of total benthic species (in studies assessing sessile and mobile species together), sessile invertebrates and corals (in studies assessing these groups individually). In contrast, non-indigenous species were significantly more abundant on wood than metal. Concrete supported greater abundances of the general community, including habitat-forming species, compared to wood.

Weakfish Cynoscion regalis (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) is one of the most recent invasive fish species in the Iberian Peninsula (Europe) which once sustained an important fishery in the native range (Northwest Atlantic Ocean). Portugal ranks third in the list of the world’s fish consumers, so promoting a weakfish fishery could at least minimize the impacts upon native species, since weakfish have innate traits that are appreciated by Portuguese fish consumers. However, introducing a new species to consumers is challenging owing to consumers’ habits and unfamiliarity with the species. So, we aimed to (i) evaluate the acceptance of weakfish by a panel of Portuguese fish consumers and (ii) create outreach actions—partnerships with local Chefs and press releases—to explain to a broader audience what invasive species are and promote the consumption of edible aquatic invasive species. We conducted a consumers survey that showed that weakfish has great chances of being well accepted by Portuguese fish consumers– 90% would buy weakfish because they appreciated its appearance, flavor, and texture, besides being a wild fish. The outreach actions reached a few million people because 46 online articles were published, and three news pieces were broadcasted on national television. Our strategy increased the public’s awareness about weakfish as an invasive species, which could be adapted for other non-indigenous marine species elsewhere in the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1007/s10530-021-02685-3,Blue economy;Commercial fishery;Invasive species;Media;Outreach;Weakfish;Iberian Peninsula;Portugal;edible species;food consumption;invasive species;new species;teleost,,,10.1007/s10530-021-02685-3,DOI(,,,,,,,

In that vein, Racial Capitalism posits that capitalist markets promote, solidify and rely on racial hierarchy to secure differential value accumulation. This study applies a Racial Capitalist analysis to illustrate how the expansion of capitalist social relations corresponded the re-solidification of white supremacy to (re)produce systemic inequality in Black maritime labour, and specifically fisheries labour, on the U.S. eastern seaboard. In this case, which occurred across several states and in a critically important marine-fishery system, the expansion of market relations corresponded with labour exploitation, naturalization of hierarchy and inequitable distribution of socioeconomic harm for Black workers.

At the national level, the ocean has received increasing consideration, with many coastal states and islands adopting blue economy strategies and frameworks, and putting the ocean at the centre of development. SDG 14: Life Below Water includes ten targets, four of which (14.2, 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6) expired in 2020. This paper presents the state of progress on these four targets that address marine protection and fisheries management. The study is based on an assessment of the indicators established by the United Nations for each target, using publicly available databases allowing to measure the achievement of the targets. The analysis shows that achievement of these four targets is meagre. Only two countries achieved three of the four targets, while no country achieved all four. Most countries were classified as far from achievement or having made low progress. Across the four targets, SDG 14.5 on marine protected areas saw the highest number of achievers but also a high number of countries still far from achievement. Europe and Oceania had the highest number of countries having performed well in terms of achievement while Africa and the Middle East showed the most countries with limited achievement. These results indicate that there is still a long way to go to achieve these four targets in 2030. To move towards achievement, more investment is needed towards priority countries that have seen limited achievement but also some adaptation might be needed in terms of monitoring processes. Finally, it seems useful at this point to reflect on what has been achieved and how countries, especially those facing various socio-economic and political challenges, can fully benefit from current processes towards implementing SDG 14. © 2022 The Authors",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106273,Africa;Europe;Middle East;Conservation;Economics;Environmental protection;Oceanography;Planning;Blue economies;Classifieds;Fisheries management;Global agenda;Marine Fishery;Marine protected area;Marine protection;National level;United Nations;World Ocean;adoption behavior;database;Sustainable Development Goal;Sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106273,DOI(,,,,,,,

Islands are vulnerable to climate change because of their isolated geography, large coastal areas, and low economic diversification. This paper presents a model-based evaluation of the macroeconomic impacts of climate change on the Blue Economy of southern European islands. We consider climate change impact chains on tourism, maritime transport, and electricity demand in a downscaled modeling framework for different climatic scenarios to the end of the century. Our findings show important economic losses in all climatic scenarios, yet economic damages under an RCP8.5 scenario more than doubled compared to a RCP2.6 pathway. Magnitudes of impacts vary across islands, depending on the level of economic diversification and geographic remoteness. The effects of climate change on the tourism sector are detrimental to the islandic economies, given the sector’s complex value chain and dominant position in value added. Similarly, increasing electricity demand for cooling and water desalination puts additional stress on the economy of the islands. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Maybe ,  Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s10584-022-03310-5,Blue Economy;CGE;Climate change;Climate costs;Economic impacts;Islands;Europe;Biodiversity;Climate models;Costs;Desalination;Economic and social effects;Electric power utilization;Losses;Water filtration;Blue economies;Climate cost;Climatic scenarios;Economic diversification;Economy sectors;Electricity demands;Island;Macroeconomic impact;Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum;climate change;economic conditions;economic diversification;global climate;island;macroeconomics;tourism,,,10.1007/s10584-022-03310-5,DOI(,10.1007/s10584-022-03310-5,DOI(10.1007/s10584-022-03310-5) OR,,,,,

Like the nation as a whole, California relies on trade for seafood, which can have effects on livelihoods, food security, human rights and environmental justice. Expanding aquaculture could contribute to food supply and security and provide a more sustainable way to produce food in the future. The United States has recently expressed an interest in increasing domestic production of seafood, in the Executive Order Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth, with the direct desired results of increased local and sustainable food, decreased foreign dependence, and increased jobs. California is re-examining its seafood sector and needs to reconcile disparities in production and consumption as the state navigates a changing seafood landscape. Understanding the current seafood landscape is necessary for making informed decisions to secure a resilient, sustainable, and equitable seafood sector. To reflect the goals recently stated in the Executive Order, we ask 1) what is the state of seafood production and consumption in California, 2) what is the trade landscape for seafood within California, both domestic and international, and 3) how have people in California experienced this interaction between production, trade, and consumption, through the lens of employment. We find California consumes upward of three times more seafood than it produces by volume, and relies heavily on international imports to make up the production gap, with roughly half of imported production likely coming from aquaculture. This reliance has radiating effects, such as displacement of environmental burden to other, often poorer and less regulated countries, and to places where seafood production is likely associated with human rights violations. Wild capture is unlikely to increase, so any increase in domestic production will come from aquaculture. To meet this call, California has a choice along a spectrum of increased state production via aquaculture or increased dependence on aquacultured imports, both foreign and domestic. Currently, the state has the capacity to be proactive rather than reactive as it charts a path forward. © 2022","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,aquaculture",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738009,Aquaculture;Blue economy;Blue growth;California;Employment;Seafood;Trade;United States;aquaculture;food security;food supply;human rights;landscape change;livelihood;seafood;Food,,,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738009,DOI(,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738009,DOI(10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738009) OR,,,,,

The objective of this article is to assess if the existing blue economy initiatives are adequate to the sectoral investment needs and to develop contours of a framework that could accelerate the blue economy investments. The research finds that the current initiatives such as blue bonds are relatively small and accelerating investments requires access to additional financing instruments and a transformative change in participating stakeholders. Using a Theory of Change approach, contours of a framework that pools in low-cost funds from a diverse set of investors to be deployed for either public sector promoted large impact projects or individual blue economy projects through market-based instruments are suggested.

To do so necessitates baseline understanding of the ocean’s contribution to socio-economic well-being, which we do by measuring the economic activity of ocean-related sectors. Economic assessments tend to be data intensive and are typically reliant on professional economists, yet they are increasingly relevant to non-economists who engage in ocean management and communication, where they are integral in facilitating trade-off analysis of future ocean change. Thus, there is a need to make ocean economic assessment more accessible to nonspecialists. We fill this need by providing a pragmatic framework for conducting an economic assessment using British Columbia’s ocean sector as a case study. Our results show the impact of the province’s ocean sectors on four economic indicators and indicate that the ocean contributed almost $5 billion (or about 2%) to provincial gross domestic product (GDP) and generated about 106,120 jobs (over 4% of the province’s total) in 2015. Of these, the marine transport sector made the highest overall contribution followed by cruise lines, with GDP impacts of 66% and 13%, respectively. It should be noted that this estimated economic value is not representative of the full value of the ocean as it excludes oil and gas, research and education, and other activities that do not meet our criteria for inclusion, and it does not account for cultural and ecological values. Nonetheless the study highlights the substantial number of economic benefits generated by the blue economy. More significantly, the framework provides a simplified procedure for quantifying economic benefits, and can be applied by nonspecialists to perform rapid economic assessments in a variety of contexts. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,non-targeted",10.3390/su14148662,British Columbia;ocean economic benefits;ocean economy;rapid economic impact assessment;Canada;Columbia [Missouri];Pacific Coast;Pacific Ocean;trade-off,,,10.3390/su14148662,DOI(,10.3390/su14148662,DOI(10.3390/su14148662) OR,,,,,

The selected inputs were the length of the shoreline (km), area (ha), tourism investments (million EGP), quality of coral reefs, numbers of hotels, and tourism accommodation capacity. While the outputs were employees’ number and tourists’ number. The results indicate that, generally, the tourism centres in the Southern Red Sea region of Egypt showed high-efficiency scores, which reflects their good preparedness to implement the various coastal tourism development strategies from the blue economy perspective.

Currently in the Atlantic salmon processing industry, 40–50% of the fish body ends up as by-products, which contain a variety of nutrients and are mainly processed into functional ingredients for premium pet food and animal feed. With the global increase of interest in nutritional diets and supplements, more research has been performed for the valorization of salmon by-products into value-added food products for human consumption. In the present study, an immobilized protease was used for hydrolysis of Atlantic salmon by-products to extract salmon oil. Alcalase was immobilized on chitosan-coated iron (II, III) oxide nanoparticles via glutaraldehyde crosslinking. The immobilized Alcalase was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope. The optimum pH and temperature range for the immobilized Alcalase were determined as 8 and 55–65 °C, respectively. The salmon oil extraction process using the immobilized Alcalase was optimized through a factorial design, and the highest oil yield of 20.55% (88.30% recovery) was obtained from 1 h of hydrolysis at 65 °C. The oil recovery using the immobilized Alcalase was comparable to the use of free Alcalase. The low levels of oxidation and hydrolysis indicated the high quality of the extracted oil, which is promising to be processed into high-value products such as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. The immobilized Alcalase was collected using a magnet and reused at least three batches without a significant decrease in oil yield, indicating its potential for effective and consecutive oil extraction from salmon by-products. The present study would promote the production of value chain products from unutilized Atlantic salmon resources and achieve sustainable development of the blue economy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737546,Alcalase;Atlantic salmon;Enzymatic hydrolysis;Immobilization;Marine by-products;Salmo salar;aquaculture system;detection method;experimental study;hydrolysis;nanoparticle;salmonid;sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737546,DOI(,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737546,DOI(10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737546) OR,,,,,

Various point absorbers have been developed based on multi-freedom oscillating structures to capture wave energy. However, the choice of geometrical parameters for buoy design is still a critical problem. This paper presents a novel method to develop new geometries of floating buoy for wave energy harvester (WEH) in heave motion and aims to maximize WEH absorbed power and performance. Fives shapes (Cyl-Cone, Cyl-HS, Cyl-TCC, Cyl-AS and Cyl-SP) were derived from a cylinder buoy based on identical parameters (radius, draft, mass, water-plane area, volume and natural frequency). The Cyl-HS buoy was selected as a reference buoy for comparative analysis. The effects of shape change on the performance and output power were investigated for regular and irregular wave conditions in ANSYS AQWA at an incident wave frequency of 0.22 Hz (low energy density seas). The optimal resonant buoy was identified employing optimal and sub-optimal modes of the PTO system at external stiffness and damping parameters. Moreover, the performance of resonant buoys in optimal and suboptimal working modes was validated statistically using the F-test for variances of two samples in Origin Pro (2019). The energy conversion efficiencies of Cyl-AS buoy were examined as highest among others, with a maximum of 8.4% and 7.4% rise in optimal and suboptimal PTO modes for regular waves, respectively. For irregular waves, the Cyl-AS buoy resulted in maximum output power of 33.9% higher than the Cyl-HS buoy (reference buoy) with a maximum conversion efficiency of 90%. Finally, the simulation and experimental results for the scaled model were compared for RAO and average power and found a good agreement.

This engagement would provide some directed actions on how Blue Economy is contributing to achieving Sustainable Development in Africa. The methodology to analyze the Blue Economy data is based on “Sociographic, Type of activities, Intellectual Property focus and Business Model development, Descriptive Statistics, Business Models, Ranking of existing projects by business and innovation readiness”. Additional data obtained from Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and National Blue Economy Strategies and online internet search. The Blue Economy cuts-across several industries, sectors, and thematic areas. This inherently creates complexity when attempting to understand the extent of its socioeconomic context in aspiration of development achievement. The effect of human dependence on Blue Economy resources is not always monetary. Some of the people use the resources for artisanal purposes, for exchange and trade, while others utilize it for the recreational and religious benefits associated with the blue natural resources. The well-being of people is a central pillar of the Blue Economy resulting in an immediate need to understand the socioeconomics of the Blue Economy as well as how to measure changes, or progress, associated with it for development achievement. The planning aspect of Blue Economy requires strategic interventions at local, national, and regional levels that spur integration aspects of the Blue Economy into development achievement. The Blue Economy development achievements require engagement of the stakeholders and elaborate consultations of the African Union Member States and Regional Economic Communities. This is because Blue Economy entails the sustainable use and conservation of marine, inland, aquatic, and coastal resources for food security, job creation, and economic growth. It is important therefore to ensure an overall consistency, coherency and synergy and develop bridges and leverage resources between the various implementation plans for strategies including Blue Economy strategies developed by some National and Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in Africa.

The sustainable development of SCSIRs is a cornerstone of coordinated development and cooperative governance in the SCS. As most SCSIRs are coral reefs with a fragile ecological environment and simplified development models, this study aims to quantitatively and multi-dimensionally explore the current status of their sustainable development to add scientific development planning and improve China's own ocean governance capabilities. The scientific assessment of island and reef development is the inevitable choice for sustainable development of SCSIRs. Based on the method of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process, Entropy Weight Method, and combined weight, a subject-objective weight coupling evaluation method for the sustainable development of SCSIRs was developed that can reflect their development status relatively objectively and comprehensively. In addition, the Yongxing Dao (the Yongxing Island), the Zhaoshu Dao (the Zhaoshu Island), the Nanxun Jiao (the Gaven Reef), the Meiji Jiao (the Mischief Reef), the Zhubi Jiao (the Subi Reef), and the Yongshu Jiao (the Fiery Cross Reef) were used as case studies to explore the potential of sustainable development of SCSIRs. The results showed that all six SCSIRs had the potential for sustainable development, and the development focus of the SCSIRs was mainly on the three levels of society, resources, and strategy. The ranking of the sustainable development value of the six islands and reefs is Yongxing Dao > Yongshu Jiao > Meiji Jiao > Zhubi Jiao > Zhaoshu Dao > Nanxun Jiao, among which Yongxing Dao has the highest level of sustainable development (64.19) and a clear advantage in terms of social development and geographical location, while Nanxun Jiaohas the lowest level of sustainable development (38.84) due to harsh weather conditions and fragile ecological environment, leading to difficult circumstances when building and living on the reef. Based on the evaluation results and the actual situation, this study comprehensively analyzes the strengths and weaknesses in the development of SCSIRs and proposes the development of regional centers, comprehensive guarantees, characteristic industries, and national defense and rights safeguarding for the development of SCSIRs. Moreover, the study distinguishes the types of islands and reefs along four dimensions and provides social governance strategies and recommendations regarding resource utilization, infrastructure, and maritime cooperation. In these cases, this study can facilitate the formation of high-quality and high-efficiency application pilots for SCSIRs and promote their sustainable development. Thus, it furthers the construction of a modern system for the social governance of SCSIRs, advances the development of the blue economy in the SCS region, provides security for the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and maritime cooperation, and makes China a strong promoter in the construction of a community of common destiny in the SCS. © 2022 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

Advancement of the existing HAB forecasting systems requires development of forecasting tools, improvements in data flow and processing, but also additional data inputs to assess the distribution of HAB species, especially in areas away from national monitoring stations, usually located near aquaculture sites. In this contribution, we review different novel technologies for acquiring HAB data and report on the experience gained in several novel local data collection exercises performed during the project.

Drawing on Fricker's concept of epistemic injustice, we examine how discrimination and lack of interpretative concepts to communicate unjust experiences wrongs small-scale fisheries people in their capacity as knowledge holders and subjects them to testimonial and hermeneutical injustice. We examine 20 testimonies of injustices experienced by small-scale fisheries people collected by the Global Research Network “Too Big To Ignore” (TBTI) and suggest a glossary of new concepts that can be used to interpret these experiences.

Depending on the context, such analyses may focus on different dimensions, spatial scales, and hazards. In the particular context of climate change, the variability inherent to the developed assessments has led to the emergence of numerous methodological frameworks, allowing for advances in the field while raising uncertainties on applied concepts, definitions, and approaches. In the present study, we developed a systematic literature review to analyze and discuss the key concepts, methodologies, and limitations of existing vulnerability and risk assessments of main ocean uses to global climate change. We analyzed over 314 scientific references regarding the elements considered in the analysis (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity), dimensions (e.g., ecological, economic, social), type of indicators (e.g., quantitative, qualitative), maritime activities, climate-related drivers of change, and spatial scales. Results show that most vulnerability and risk assessments address fisheries and marine conservation, and that sea-level rise and extreme events are the most frequently considered climate-related drivers of change. The main identified limitations pertain to the level of subjectivity and the tremendous variety of concepts, areas of expertise, and systems addressed in such studies. We highlight that further research is needed particularly on the development of cross-sectoral studies and integrative approaches, using multiple indicators and frameworks. There is also a need for assessments explicitly designed to support ocean planning and integrated marine management processes. Review processes such as the present one provide a “big picture,” allowing for a global view on complex topics, and contributing to advances in the field.

Concerns have been raised about the implications for biodiversity. Here, we present a review of current research on the two approaches to determine their relationship to each other and to other economic models, their impact on sustainability and their relationship with biodiversity. Bioeconomy and circular economy are both poorly defined, inconsistently implemented and inadequately measured, and neither provides a clear pathway to sustainability. Many actors promote goals around economic growth above environmental issues. Biodiversity is often addressed indirectly or inadequately. Furthermore, many traditionally disadvantaged groups, including women and indigenous people, may be neglected and rarely engage or benefit. These challenges are compounded by capacity gaps and legal and governance complexities around implementation, influenced by traditional mindsets and approaches. Countries and companies need to plan their sustainability strategies more explicitly around the biodiversity they impact. Opportunities include the relevance and timeliness of sustainable economics for delivering Sustainable Development Goals in a post-COVID world, the existence of work to be built on, and the diversity of stakeholders already engaged. We propose five main steps to ensure the sustainability of economic approaches.

Charter boat fishing has been little studied in temperate regions, and the factors that trigger its development and social contribution to fishing communities are unknown. We performed an economic analysis of recreational charter boat fisheries in the Eastern North Atlantic to assess their contribution to social welfare. We selected two case studies located in Galicia (NW Spain) and Madeira archipelago (Portugal). The two cases differ in the socioecological attributes in which recreational charter boat fishing is developed (e.g., relevance of commercial fishing, tourism, or targeted species), that were included in the assessment. Up to 7 charter fishing companies were identified in Galicia (10 boats) and 14 in Madeira (18 boats), and information on the costs and benefits of the activity were collected by a questionnaire answered by company managers and skippers. Charter boats in Galicia are operating throughout the year, and anglers mostly engage in bottom fishing targeting demersal predators like ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) that they retain. Despite the strong seasonality of the fishery in Madeira, focused on summers, the fishing effort is higher than in Galicia. On average, charter boats go fishing for 39.3 ± 41.5 (SD) fishing journeys and take 2 500 anglers on board per year in Galicia, while in Madeira they fish 63.7 ± 32.7 journeys and take 3 200 anglers on board. Anglers target in Madeira pelagic top predators like blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), or some tuna species, e.g., bigeye (Thunnus obesus), by trolling in a catch and release fishery. The economic balance of companies was more favorable in Madeira, with an average gross annual profit of € 28 883 ± 30 755, while economic yield in Galicia was € 4 444 ± 7 916. We also applied a travel cost method to assess the recreation demand of recreational fishing trips based on a questionnaire answered by 150 clients in Galicia and 55 in Madeira. We estimated the visitor surplus mean value to be € 1 385 per year in Galicia (95% confidence interval, CI95%= € 1 219 – € 1 550), and € 1 738 in Madeira (CI95%= € 1 433 – 2 043). The social annual recreation value of Galician fishery was worth € 3.4 Million, ranging between € 3.0 M and € 3.8 M, a value well below the annual economic impact generated by commercial fishing (€ 700 M). The recreation value of the charter boat fishery in Madeira, € 6.3 M, ranging between € 5.2 M and € 7.5 M, is comparable to the annual economic impact of commercial fishing, that contributes to the local economy with € 12 M.

While successes have been reported, for example, in Europe and China, examples of African successes are notably missing. Abject poverty, unemployment and food insecurity are everyday concerns on the African continent; however, its large latitudinal coverage gives rise to extremely biodiverse marine fauna, which could promote socio-economic development of coastal communities through initiatives such as sustainably-managed fisheries. In order to improve sustainability via improved management, information on a species and its habitat is needed, particularly how it moves and in which areas it occurs. Acoustic telemetry is a powerful tool used to determine the movements of aquatic animals, the success of which has led to the development of several large-scale networks throughout the globe, including South Africa’s Acoustic Tracking Array Platform. This network, formally in place for the last decade, has now matured, and data are revealing insights into residency, habitat connectivity and transboundary movements of a multitude of animals, with some species having been continually detected for the past 10 years. These data are also actively being incorporated into marine spatial planning efforts, with the aim of protecting threatened and endemic species. Due to knowledge generation, successful benefit-sharing arrangements, and dedication to engage with the public and other stakeholder groups, the ATAP represents a highly successful example of ocean stewardship in Africa.

The problems are two-fold: 1) manual and siloed data collection and processing, and 2) reliance on marine professionals for observation and analysis.

With limited space and degraded resources in coastal areas, offshore waters will be a particular focus of Blue Economy expansion over the next decade. When emerging and established economic sectors expand in offshore waters (within national Exclusive Economic Zones), different potential Blue Economy opportunities and challenges will arise. Following a series of interdisciplinary workshops, we imagine two technically possible futures for the offshore Blue Economy and we identify the actions required to achieve the more sustainable outcome. Under a business as usual scenario the focus will remain on economic growth, the commodification of nature, the dominance of private over public and cultural interests, and prioritisation of the interests of current over future generations. A more sustainable scenario would meet multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals and ensure inclusive economic developments, environmental sustainability, and fair and equitable access to resources and technologies across users, nations, and generations. Challenges to this more sustainable future are a lack of infrastructure and technology to support emerging offshore sectors, limited understanding of environmental impacts, inequitable outcomes, and a lack of planning and governmental oversight. Addressing these challenges will require a shift in societal values, a more balanced allocation of funding to offshore activities, transparency in information sharing between industries and across nations, and adjustment of international legal and institutional mechanisms. The sustainable and equitable offshore Blue Economy we envisage is achievable and provides a unique opportunity to build global capacity and partnership.

This study shows that European Union (EU) fisheries are likely resilient to climate-driven short-term stresses, but may be negatively impacted by long-term trends in climate change. However, fisheries’ long-term stock resilience can be improved (and therefore be more resilient to increasing changes in climate) by adopting robust and adaptive fisheries management, provided such measures are based on sound scientific advice which includes uncertainty. Such management requires regular updates of biological reference points. Such updates will delineate safe biological limits for exploitation, providing both high long-term yields with reduced risk of stock collapse when affected by short-term stresses, and enhanced compliance with advice to avoid higher than intended fishing mortality. However, high resilience of the exploited ecosystem does not necessarily lead to the resilience of the economy of EU fisheries from suffering shocks associated with reduced yields, neither to a reduced carbon footprint if fuel use increases from lower stock abundances. Fuel consumption is impacted by stock development, but also by changes in vessel and gear technologies, as well as fishing techniques. In this respect, energy-efficient fishing technologies already exist within the EU, though implementing them would require improving the uptake of innovations and demonstrating to stakeholders the potential for both reduced fuel costs and increased catch rates. A transition towards reducing fuel consumption and costs would need to be supported by the setup of EU regulatory instruments. Overall, to effectively manage EU fisheries within a changing climate, flexible, adaptive, well-informed and well-enforced management is needed, with incentives provided for innovations and ocean literacy to cope with the changing conditions, while also reducing the dependency of the capture fishing industry on fossil fuels. To support such management, we provide 10 lessons to characterize ‘win-win’ fishing strategies for the European Union, which develop leverages in which fishing effort deployed corresponds to Maximum Sustainable Yield targets and Common Fisheries Policy minimal effects objectives. In these strategies, higher catch is obtained in the long run, less fuel is spent to attain the catch, and the fisheries have a higher resistance and resilience to shock and long-term factors to face climate-induced stresses.

At the same time, a considerable portion of global marine water bodies has been suffering from eutrophication due to excessive nutrient loading. The marine environment can be considered as a valuable phosphorus source due to nutrient rich eutrophic seawater and sediment which could potentially serve as phosphorus mines in the near future. Hence, sustainable phosphorus recovery strategies should be adapted for marine systems to provide phosphorus for the growing market demand and simultaneously control eutrophication. In this review, possible sustainable strategies for phosphorus removal and recovery from marine environments are discussed in detail. Bio-based strategies relying on natural phosphorus uptake/release metabolism of living organisms are suggested as promising options that can provide both phosphorus removal and recovery from marine waters for achieving a sustainable marine ecosystem. Among them, the utilization of microorganisms seems promising to develop novel strategies. However, the research gap for the technical applicability of these strategies is still considerably big. Therefore, future research should focus on the technical development of the strategies through laboratory and/or field studies. Coupling phosphorus mining with other valorisation pathways (i.e., metal recovery, energy production) is also suggested to improve overall sustainability and economic viability.

Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has become a powerful technology to support various applications such as collecting real-time aquatic information, naval military applications, maritime security, natural disaster prediction and control, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwrecks discovery, water contamination, marine life observation and smart Ocean. IoUT is referred as smart intricately linked underwater objects to monitor these underwater operations. The IoUT framework incorporates several underwater communication technologies based on magnetic induction, optical signals, radio signals and acoustic waves. It is an emerging communication ecosystem which can reveal a new era of research, business and naval applications. It is a novel and vibrant paradigm for the Blue Economy sector bringing the ability to communicate autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensing, actuating and transferring this data to control centers using regular internet speeds through low cost technologies. It is anticipated to support future networking systems which can bring tremendous improvement in previous generations in terms of stable networking, high coverage, massive connectivity, low latency, high data rate and low power consumption. This study introduces the possible network framework of IoUT which is naturally heterogeneous and must be flexible enough to work under unpredicted ocean conditions. In this study, we examine channel models, routing protocols, networking topologies and simulation tools. Furthermore, we discussed recent advancements in IoUT in terms of smart devices, consumer electronics, communication and role of AUVs. In addition, edge computing, optical wireless communication (OWC), data analytics, blockchain, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and machine learning were viewed as promising techniques to support IoUT. We have dedicated a complete section to applications of IoUT. Finally, numerous open research challenges and future directions were presented.

Mangrove restoration efforts have received considerable attention in the States of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh for their role in the mitigation of storms and cyclones. The ‘community-based restoration' strategy, in particular, is credited with expansion of mangrove regions across India. This study highlights the mechanism of successful mangrove restoration and conservation through various efforts of the government, private sector, and the coastal community in the state of Gujarat, India. Despite rapid coastal development, mangrove cover has also steadily increased in the last few decades in the State, clearly indicating a balanced approach towards enhancing blue economy. This is credited to the vision of the Government of Gujarat, India for putting in place appropriate policies and their effective implementation. Restoration of degraded mangrove and afforestation of new mangroves were made successful by applying scientific transplantation of saplings, utilization of local resources, involvement of public and private sectors and efficient monitoring activities. The Government of Gujarat has developed a comprehensive approach to integrate diverse sectors to effectively conserve mangroves and adopting a community-based restoration model.

Because the demand for critical metals is increasing and land-based mineral deposits are being depleted, seafloor resources are seen as the next frontier for mineral exploration and extraction. Marine mineral deposits with a great resource potential for transition, rare, and critical metals include mainly deep-sea mineral deposits, such as polymetallic sulfides, polymetallic nodules, cobalt-rich crusts, phosphorites, and rare earth element-rich muds. Major areas with economic interest for seabed mineral exploration and mining are the following: nodules in the Penrhyn Basin-Cook Islands Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Clarion-Clipperton nodule Zone, Peru Basin nodules, and the Central Indian Ocean Basin; seafloor massive sulfide deposits in the exclusive economic zones of Papua New Guinea, Japan, and New Zealand as well as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the three Indian Ocean spreading ridges; cobalt-rich crusts in the Pacific Prime Crust Zone and the Canary Islands Seamounts and the Rio Grande Rise in the Atlantic Ocean; and the rare earth element-rich deep-sea muds around Minamitorishima Island in the equatorial North Pacific. In addition, zones for marine phosphorites exploration are located in Chatham Rise, offshore Baja California, and on the shelf off Namibia. Moreover, shallow-water resources, like placer deposits, represent another marine source for many critical minerals, metals, and gems. The main concerns of deep-sea mining are related to its environmental impacts. Ecological impacts of rare earth element mining on deep-sea ecosystems are still poorly evaluated. Furthermore, marine mining may cause conflicts with various stakeholders such as fisheries, communications cable owners, offshore wind farms, and tourism. The global ocean is an immense source of food, energy, raw materials, clean water, and ecosystem services and suffers seriously by multiple stressors from anthropogenic sources. The development of a blue economy strategy needs a better knowledge of the environmental impacts. By protecting vulnerable areas, applying new technologies for deep-sea mineral exploration and mining, marine spatial planning, and a regulatory framework for minerals extraction, we may achieve sustainable management and use of our oceans.  © 2022 IUPAC & De Gruyter.

Several calls are made to scale the industry up and to use blue carbon financing to create additional incentives for the sector to expand. But how much of a climate crisis panacea is seaweed, and under which conditions can climate benefits be realized? The article reviews the literature on climate impacts from seaweed value chains and proposes a cradle-to-grave structure for carbon accounting in seaweed value chains. While the literature points towards several ways in which climate benefits can be generated, the evidence base for net negative emissions across the value chain is not robust enough to suggest seaweed value chains, by default, are a climate solution. Instead, climate effects depend on the specific production setup, product choice and the fate of the product on the market. Climate benefits can only be claimed by tracking blue carbon flows across whole life cycles and over time. Knowledge gaps relate to effects at sea, the role of temporarily locking carbon into products and the effects of introducing this resource to the market.

Such compounds have been used in several industries from low-to high-value-such as food, feed, nutraceutical, and cosmetics-mainly due to their unique chemical properties and bioactive potential. Despite their great potential for biotechnological propose, the use of these organisms is still limited to process viability. Only Arthrospira spp. (Spirulina) has been successfully applied in the market worldwide. The current implementation of cyanobacteria-based bioprocesses is constrained by poor volumetric efficiency, leading to excessively high costs. Technological improvements of such processes are thus critical and will require multiple approaches at production, extraction, and purification levels. In recent years, several strategies and optimization processes have been suggested by several studies, which have provided promising prospects for the use of cyanobacteria and for the establishment of a sustainable bioprocess.

As the coastal zone constitutes one of the first recipients of the impacts of climate change due to the rise in sea level, integrated coastal zone management arises as a significant tool for the study of vulnerable coastal ecosystems. In combination with ICZM, the use of indicators and ecosystem services analysis couples all of the information, leading to an integrated approach and opportunities for a sustainable blue economy in coastal ecosystems. The aim of the present study is to form a protocol for a sustainable blue economy in the coastal zone, which will investigate and define the current capacity and the boundaries of a coastal ecosystem with specific characteristics of industrial activity, cultural heritage, and a protected natural environment. The case study for this research is the Gulf of Elefsis, a special sea basin in the eastern Mediterranean, located a short distance from the Athens metropolitan area. The Gulf of Elefsis is characterized by a developed coastal zone, which includes intense industrial activity, the ancient historical sights of Elefsis, the environmentally protected wetland of lake Koumoundourou, the town of Elefsis, a trade port, and growing shipbuilding activity. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted",10.3390/su141610323,industry;integrated coastal zone management;shipyard;sustainable blue economy;tourism;Athens;Elefsis Gulf;Gulf;Papua New Guinea;climate change,,,10.3390/su141610323,DOI(,10.3390/su141610323,DOI(10.3390/su141610323) OR,,,,,

This is particularly true for recreational anglers in Denmark, who often consider Atlantic bluefin tuna to be the catch of a lifetime. This attitude has previously sustained a substantial recreational fishery for bluefin tuna with annual tournaments in Denmark, which peaked in the 1950s before the subsequent collapse of the stock during the 1960s. Several scientific tagging programs have recruited recreational anglers in recent years to help catch and release tagged bluefin tuna. The anglers’ investment of time and money in the scientific tagging projects indicate that the recreational fishery could recover in the future. However, the economic aspects of a potential future recreational bluefin tuna fishery remain unknown. We surveyed anglers participating in a scientific catch and release bluefin tuna fishery in Denmark across three years (2018–2020) and calculated the total annual expenditures associated with the activities. Additionally, we estimated the magnitude of the negative impact (i.e., incidental mortalities) on the bluefin tuna stock. Our results show that total annual expenditures by the recreational anglers approached 1,439,540€, totaling 4,318,620€ between 2018 and 2020. We found that recreational bluefin tuna anglers had mean annual expenditures directly related to the bluefin tuna fishing between 7,047€ and 2,176€ with an associated mortality impact on the stock of less than 1 tonne annually. By comparing the mortality impact to the expenditures, we estimate that each dead Atlantic bluefin tuna during the three study years generated 398,163€ in mean annual expenditures, equivalent to approximately 1636€ kg-1. Our study demonstrates significant economic expenditures among recreational anglers who target Atlantic bluefin tuna. This provides a clear example of how a recovery of marine natural capital and related ecosystem services can support development in the blue economy. © 2022 Maar et al.

The objective of this study is to investigate the present status, future potentials for the development of a framework of the EAFM for the sustainable coastal and marine resource development of Bangladesh. Using both primary and secondary sources of information, this study has found that some levels of EAFM are already in practice to some extent in some specific coastal river ecosystems along the hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) sanctuaries for the protection of juvenile and brood hilsa, but often not implemented and managed in an appropriate planned and objective way. There are some signs of ecosystem well-being for a few fisheries but some levels of deterioration of the ecosystem have been noticed as well. It is unclear how this ecosystem well-being in one hand and its continued interruption and deterioration in another hand interact and affect human well-being for making a resilient society in the fishing communities. The EAFM has great potential to improve both the ecosystem and human well-being in the coming years as well as to contribute to the blue economy and achieve some SDG targets.

However, commercial-scale cultivation of microalgae still faces one major challenge, which is its economic feasibility, with lower cost and energy consumption. Developing floating photobioreactors to be utilized in offshore open water areas has gained more interest recently as it can diminish the cost effects of onshore land utilization, while seeking for additional benefits, such as regulated temperature, proximity to sunlight and nutrient supplies, and integrated ocean renewable energy. Thereby, this is timely to explore the potential of floating photobioreactors for microalgae cultivation in the offshore region. This review deliberately presents the characteristics of offshore environments and their potential effects on microalgae cultivation, as factors such as location selection, heat capacity, and utilization of cultivation resources are significantly different from conventional land-based cultivation. Compared to land-based photobioreactors, the design of floating photobioreactors has the opportunity to adopt hydrodynamical design; by utilizing the external force from ocean waves to generate internal liquid sloshing for improving the mixing of cultivation medium. While offshore-based microalgae cultivation is considerably new as part of blue economy and mariculture, this review provides insights into the opportunities for further advancement of offshore microalgae cultivation technologies. The encouraging factors for hybridization of offshore microalgae cultivation include mariculture, carbon dioxide capture and utilization, hydrogen production, and ocean thermal energy. Such understandings are vital to improving microalgae cultivation in offshore floating photobioreactors towards a valuable alternative to the current concerns in developing commercial scale of the microalgae industry. Various challenges in biological issues, economic and environmental challenges, installation and maintenance, as well as destructive hydrodynamic loads are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,aquaculture",10.1016/j.aquaeng.2022.102269,Biomass production;Floating photobioreactor;Microalgae cultivation;Mixing;Offshore technology;Wave energy;Carbon dioxide;Hydrodynamics;Hydrogen production;Microalgae;Oceanography;Offshore oil well production;Photobioreactors;Specific heat;Wave energy conversion;Biomass productions;Micro-algae;Offshore floating;Offshores;Photobiore-actor;biofuel;bioreactor;cultivation;floating offshore structure;installation;microalga;mixing;wave energy;Energy utilization,,,10.1016/j.aquaeng.2022.102269,DOI(,10.1016/j.aquaeng.2022.102269,DOI(10.1016/j.aquaeng.2022.102269) OR,,,,,

Seaweed plays a key role in the Blue Economy as a source of food, feed, and feedstock for biorefineries. Today, the largest part of global seaweed production is based in Asia, but there is also a growing interest in seaweed production in Europe. However, more knowledge on the environmental impacts is needed to ensure sustainable growth of the sector. Seaweed can be used in biorefineries to produce a variety of products for food and non-food applications. The aim of this paper was to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a seaweed value-chain, including seaweed cultivation and production into sodium alginate, biodegradable materials, biogas, and fertilizer in a biorefinery setting. The LCA included 19 environmental impact categories but focused on climate change. The seaweed Saccharina latissima was cultivated and processed in Ireland. Sodium alginate was then extracted by means of ultrasound-assisted extraction, a novel extraction technology. Cellulosic residues produced after the extraction were used for the production of films used as a packaging material. Residues that remain after the production of the films were sent to anaerobic digestion to achieve a no-waste concept. For seaweed cultivation, fuel use and drying of seaweed biomass were the main environmental hot spots; and for the alginate extraction process, the yield and purification after extraction were the main hot spots. Overall, the results of this paper showed that the seaweed-based biorefinery has the potential to be sustainable, but several improvements are necessary before it is competitive with land-based systems. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,neutral,aquaculture",10.1016/j.algal.2022.102725,Alginate;Biorefinery;LCA;Saccharina latissima;Seaweed;Food,,,10.1016/j.algal.2022.102725,DOI(,10.1016/j.algal.2022.102725,DOI(10.1016/j.algal.2022.102725) OR,,,,,

The region boasts of two vibrant Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs), namely the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) and the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem (GCLME), which provide vast fisheries and other marine resources. The region and its marine and coastal resources are however faced with diverse threats such as climate change, destruction of mangroves, overfishing, habitat destruction and coastal erosion, among many others. Several initiatives have been developed to address these challenges. This paper reviews some of the past as well as ongoing initiatives that address the challenges in the marine and coastal environment of West Africa. Among these initiatives is the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and Africa programme which uses Earth Observation (EO) data and derived information to manage marine and coastal resources, with focus on the “Marine and Coastal Areas Management in western Africa” theme implemented by the University of Ghana (UG). The Regional Marine Centre (RMC) at the University of Ghana, which serves as the Regional Implementation Centre for the GMES and Africa marine programme for West Africa, uses sentinel-1 satellite data to monitor shoreline change. This information is combined with other datasets to generate coastal vulnerability indices (CVI) map for erosion hotspots in the region, which directly feeds into policy initiatives towards addressing the problem of coastal erosion in the region. This, as a result, contributes to building coastal resilience and alleviating the severe impacts of climate change on the West Africa coast, and contributing to the Blue Economy agenda. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted",10.1007/s41976-021-00058-x,Blue Economy;Climate change;Coastal erosion;Coastal vulnerability indices;Earth Observation;GMES and Africa;West Africa;climate change;climate effect;coastal erosion;coastal zone;environmental monitoring;marine environment;vulnerability;Africa,,,10.1007/s41976-021-00058-x,DOI(,10.1007/s41976-021-00058-x,DOI(10.1007/s41976-021-00058-x) OR,,,,,

More specifically, small-scale fisheries (SSF) are increasingly being threatened by ocean grabbing, pollution, and a lack of inclusiveness in decision-making processes. Although there are guidelines to resolve and reduce conflict, formal avenues to include fisher concerns, particularly in the context of ocean development and governance, remain a difficult task. Moreover, there is insufficient information on how fishers are impacted by coastal and marine development and how their concerns are included in the decision-making process. Hence, this study contributes to the SSF discourse by understanding and describing the characteristics and concerns of small-scale fishers from two coastal towns in East Africa with different levels of port development. Using data from perception surveys, focus group discussions, and participatory mapping, we discuss how fishers were involved in the decision-making processes to develop ports in Lamu, Kenya, and Bagamoyo, Tanzania. We found that fishers rely on nearshore ecosystems such as mangroves and coral reefs because of their accessibility since most fishers only use low-powered boats for fishing. Moreover, we found that the fishers’ livelihoods were severely affected by port development and that they were excluded from the decision-making process concerning the port’s construction and fishers’ compensations. While some fishers believe that new ports in the region can increase their livelihoods by creating new markets and jobs, this is unlikely to happen since most fishers are not qualified to work in formal port-related jobs. We propose three steps that will allow fishermen to participate in port development decision-making processes and contribute to the development of a sustainable SSF. These include improving engagement with fishers to allow meaningful participation in decision-making, developing a blue economy policy focused on SSF, and implementing maritime spatial planning.

To date, most thermoplasmonic applications are based on Ag and Au NPs, whose cost of raw materials inevitably limits the scalability for industrial applications requiring large amounts of photothermal NPs, as in the case of desalination plants. On the other hand, alternative nanomaterials proposed so far exhibit severe restrictions associated with the insufficient photothermal efficacy in the visible, the poor chemical stability, and the challenging scalability. Here, it is demonstrated the outstanding potential of NiSe and CoSe topological nodal-line semimetals for thermoplasmonics. The anisotropic dielectric properties of NiSe and CoSe activate additional plasmonic resonances. Specifically, NiSe and CoSe NPs support multiple localized surface plasmons in the optical range, resulting in a broadband matching with sunlight radiation spectrum. Finally, it is validated the proposed NiSe and CoSe-based thermoplasmonic platform by implementing solar-driven membrane distillation by adopting NiSe and CoSe nanofillers embedded in a polymeric membrane for seawater desalination. Remarkably, replacing Ag with NiSe and CoSe for solar membrane distillation increases the transmembrane flux by 330% and 690%, respectively. Correspondingly, costs of raw materials are also reduced by 24 and 11 times, respectively. The results pave the way for the advent of NiSe and CoSe for efficient and sustainable thermoplasmonics and related applications exploiting sunlight within the paradigm of the circular blue economy. © 2022 The Authors.

The OD will establish a common strategy to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the other European Union (EU) and international agreements, such as the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Marine Biodiversity Strategy and the UN World Assessment I and II aimed at preserving ocean health. Furthermore, the OD has several expected outcomes that concern different aspects of marine environment, including its enormous values for humans. Several entities will combine efforts to achieve these goals and science is at the forefront of the sustainable blue economy. Marine research is solving complex challenges through interdisciplinary approaches, revolutionizing our life and our interaction with the ocean. This review discusses recent advancements in science related to the OD outcomes. The role of new technology for ocean exploration and monitoring, the importance of omics science and biotechnology to deal with ocean pollution, and other innovative solutions are discussed. All of these are inspired by the idea of using marine resources in a sustainable way and without impacting in a negative way on marine ecosystems. The role of science communication is therefore considered a crucial issue to spread the OD messages and to reach the general public and stakeholders. Only by the integration of science, governance, industry and public, the OD will have any chance to succeed.

This is even more pronounced when compared with other traditional marine activities (i.e. commercial fisheries), which are the target of monitoring programs that span several decades. The paucity of information on marine ecotourism and the disproportionate influence of traditional activities in decision-making arenas represent a practical impediment to promoting the broader agenda of blue growth and ecosystem-based management for Europe's regional seas. This study presents an assessment of the socioeconomic impact of non-extractive recreational activities closely associated with marine biodiversity (i.e. whale watching, diving and big game fishing) in one of Europe's outermost regions: the Azores archipelago (northeast Atlantic). Data were collected through a series of questionnaire surveys of the clients (n = 1740) and managers of marine-tourism businesses (n = 49). Our results suggest that in 2014 approximately 17% of total visitors to the Azores engaged in marine ecotourism activities generating approximately 80€ million in total expenditures to the regional economy (2.2% of regional Gross Domestic Product). Results also indicate that on average a typical marine ecotourist has longer stay and higher expenditure pattern compared to other visitors. These values add a new dimension to arguments in support of marine conservation and call attention to the comprehensive integration of marine ecotourism activities in management plans. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,tourism",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106129,Azores;Employment;Marine ecotourism;Non-extractive activities;Participation;Socio-economic impact;Visitor expenditure;Atlantic Ocean;Atlantic Ocean (Northeast);Europe;Biodiversity;Decision making;Ecology;Economic and social effects;Economics;Fisheries;Surveys;Azore;Blue economies;Coastal regions;Economic activities;Non-extractive activity;Socio-economic impacts;Socio-economics;coastal zone;decision making;ecotourism;heat island;island;marine environment;monitoring;monitoring system;socioeconomic conditions;strategic approach;Regional planning;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106129,DOI(,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106129,DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106129) OR,,,,,

These discourses, originating on land, have spread spatially, narratively and normatively to the marine realm — part of a larger process of the normalization of the sea via its inclusion in the dominant model of economic development. The author uses the concept of horizontal reciprocity to illuminate this process of normalization. The blue economy requires and justifies the governance of maritime space; it creates economic and political opportunities and generates knowledge and interventions, leading to the territorialization of the sea.

This paper examines (a) how oil is sometimes included and justified in blue economy planning when its development is at odds with climate commitments and the need for just transitions away from fossil fuels, and (b) how oil could be included in blue economy planning, or transitions to blue economies and just energy transitions away from oil. We examine how tensions between sustainability/climate commitments and oil development impacts are resolved in practice, specifically by analyzing a particular approach to the blue economy that focuses on technology and innovation. The overlap of oil with renewable energy, specifically through technology, has become an important part of the recent ocean and blue economy narratives in oil-producing nations and illustrates the contradictions inherent in ocean development discourse. We draw specifically on the case of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), the only province in Canada with a mature offshore oil industry and thus the region most potentially impacted by decisions about whether to include oil in Canada’s blue economy. We argue that the blue economy approach to ocean governance being enacted in NL is currently being used as a form of legitimation for continuing the development of oil with no real transition plan away from it. Furthermore, we argue that blue economy plans must not only envision transitions to renewables but also explicitly and actively transitions away from oil to minimize environmental and social justice and equity issues at multiple scales. We end by highlighting some necessary conditions for how ocean economies that include oil, can transition to sustainable and equitable blue economies. © 2022 by the authors.

The need to manage sustainable development and future exploitation of both over-utilised and emergent coastal resources is both a political and environmental complexity. To address this complexity, we draw on the perspectives of a multi-disciplinary team, utilising two in depth exemplary case studies in New Zealand and within the Myanmar Delta Landscape, to showcase barriers, pathways and actions that facilitate a move from Business as Usual (BAU) to a future aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the UN International Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021–2030.

This has led to a policy focus on land-use change or agricultural practice change as nutrient mitigation strategies, but these fail to consider the ultimate downstream receiving environments such as marine ecosystems. Within the UK there has been increasing recognition that housing density in certain sensitive locations is impacting the conservation status of marine features, through the increase in nutrient loading to the marine environment. In order to comply with the statutory obligations to protect these marine features, the competent authorities have required developers to mitigate the impact of these additional nutrients. Current approaches include converting agricultural land to woodland and wetland habitats that release less nitrogen than the agricultural land they replace. This difference is used to offset the nutrient loading from the new development, but such a terrestrial-focused catchment-based mass balance approach has a number of limitations. Current solutions for nutrient neutrality in the UK take a narrow land-focused approach that fails to acknowledge the potential contribution of the marine environments to mitigate nutrient enrichment. We propose that marine nature-based solutions offer an economically and ecologically viable alternative to terrestrial schemes, that can reduce the nitrogen loading to the marine environment, increase ecosystem service provision and increase biodiversity. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,aquaculture",10.3390/su141610182,blue economy;low trophic aquaculture;marine policy;NbS;nitrogen;nutrient neutrality;urban planning;United Kingdom;agricultural land;agricultural practice;biodiversity;conservation status;economic conditions;ecosystem service;service provision;Food,,,10.3390/su141610182,DOI(,10.3390/su141610182,DOI(10.3390/su141610182) OR,,,,,

Seychelles has been flagged by the United Nations as highly vulnerable to climate change. Climatic threats are compounded with population declines of key fishery species. A progressive national stance towards ocean sustainability and an emerging economy partially driven by tourists are two of several factors that make Seychelles a good candidate for a sustainable seafood labelling and consumption programme, which would provide market-based incentives for fishery harvesters, regulators, buyers and consumers to improve sustainable practices. To address the feasibility of such a programme, we conducted a pilot study, surveying 33 artisanal fishers and mapping supply chain structure to examine incentives and challenges. Questions addressed fishers’ years of experience, reliance on fishing for income, and flexibility in gear type and species targeted. Of the total number of respondents, 64% would like to see a programme implemented but only 34% thought it would be successful.

Currently, the observations of local stakeholders, such as those from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, government civil servants, journalists, and fishers, are not considered in any MPA database. The Sea Around Us has added observations from local stakeholders to address this gap, adding their perspectives to its reconstructed fisheries catch database, and to at least one MPA in each country’s Exclusive Economic Zone. It is important to pursue and incentivize stakeholder knowledge sharing to achieve a better understanding of the current level of marine protection, as this information is a valuable addition to the existing MPA databases. To address this gap, we demonstrated that personal emails containing a one-question questionnaire about the fishing levels in an MPA are an excellent way to gather data from local stakeholders, and that this works especially well for respondents in NGOs, academia, and governments. Of the stakeholders who replied to our personalized email, 66% provided us with the fishing level of the MPA that we asked for. The paper also presents how to access this information through the Sea Around Us website, which details in anonymized form the most common fishing levels for each selected MPA, as perceived or observed by different local stakeholder groups. This information is a unique and novel addition to a website that is concerned with marine conservation and contributes to a more accurate and inclusive discourse around MPAs.

The database is composed of 28 anthropogenic and environmental layers categorized into seven Blue Economy sectors. The database is analyzed with a set of geospatial models aimed at understanding the intensity distribution of human activities at sea and the potential marine use conflicts emerging from the aggregation of human activities. Ecological resources were characterized in terms of marine mammals, lobsters, commercially important and threatened fish species, and pelagic birds and mapped as biodiversity hotspots using geographic cluster analysis. Results show that the most intensely used sea areas are located along the northeastern coast of Bangladesh, as well as in the Swatch of No Ground (SoNG) area, with maximum Marine Use Intensity (MUI) scores ranging from 5 to 8. Offshore waters of Saint Martin's Island have higher MUI scores (≥ 5) as well. The pairwise spatial conflict analysis shows that nature protection sites particularly SoNG Marine Protected Area (MPA), Nijhum Dwip Marine Reserve (MR), and Saint Martin's Island MPA are exposed to the high Marine Use Conflicts (MUC) induced by fishing and shipping activities. Fishing operations generate the highest MUC value (MUC = 30) in SoNG MPA, whereas shipping activities produce the highest MUC value (MUC = 24) in Nijhum Dwip MR.

In 2018, the Government developed the Climate Resilience and Recovery Plan 2020–2030 (CRRP) in the context of its National Resilience Development Strategy. These policy responses have been hailed as transformational. In this paper, we focus on the CRRP and investigate its quality. To achieve this, we conduct a desk-based qualitative assessment of the CRRP’s (1) information base; (2) vision, goals and objectives; (3) priorities and options; (4) actions and implementation; and (5) monitoring and evaluation. We find that the CRRP is strongest on (1) and (3), which is not uncommon for similar policies. We also discuss whether it can be a model for transformation in the Caribbean, given the region’s long history with trying to recover from and build resilience to disasters. We conclude that, in order for it to be used as a model, there are three key factors that other jurisdictions would need to consider. The first consideration is developing mechanisms for equitably sharing any benefits derived from the blue economy. The second consideration is centering Indigenous perspectives in environmental policy-and decision-making. The third consideration is adequately accounting for exogenous, unexpected risks. Given these three considerations, we see this study as contributing to discussions about what constitutes good policy in a SIDS context, which is an underexplored area in the existing academic literature. © 2022 by the authors.

Connectivity and representativity are essential factors that underlie successful implementation of MPA networks, which can safeguard biological diversity and ecosystem function, and ultimately support the blue economy strategy by balancing ocean use with conservation. New “big data” omics approaches, including genomics and transcriptomics, are becoming essential tools for the development and maintenance of MPA networks. Current molecular omics techniques, including population-scale genome sequencing, have direct applications for assessing population connectivity and for evaluating how genetic variation is represented within and among MPAs. Effective baseline characterization and long-term, scalable, and comprehensive monitoring are essential for successful MPA management, and omics approaches hold great promise to characterize the full range of marine life, spanning the microbiome to megafauna across a range of environmental conditions (shallow sea to the deep ocean). Omics tools, such as eDNA metabarcoding can provide a cost-effective basis for biodiversity monitoring in large and remote conservation areas. Here we provide an overview of current omics applications for conservation planning and monitoring, with a focus on metabarcoding, metagenomics, and population genomics. Emerging approaches, including whole-genome sequencing, characterization of genomic architecture, epigenomics, and genomic vulnerability to climate change are also reviewed. We demonstrate that the operationalization of omics tools can enhance the design, monitoring, and management of MPAs and thus will play an important role in a modern and comprehensive blue economy strategy.

APEC’s Xiamen Declaration on the Blue Economy pledges to advance sustainable ocean and coastal governance for purposes of fostering economic growth, including scaling up marine protected areas, tackling illegal fishing and facilitating sustainable regional trade in fish. However, the effectiveness of APEC’s initiatives for the Blue Economy and its implementation are doubtful due to its talk-shop nature. APEC has performed a reform of disciplining fisheries subsidies which have been a principal factor leading to depleted fishery stocks. By contrast, APEC has been criticized with regard to its inability to complete sensitive or complex goals, such as achieving sustainable development of the Blue Economy. This inability might arise from APEC’s de facto institutional character, which shows a lack of an establishing treaty conferring on APEC an international legal personality. Nevertheless, APEC can develop a binding agreement following the example of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) which was initiated by APEC and adopted at the WTO’s 1996 Singapore Ministerial Conference with support from APEC member economies. A recent mega-regional trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region—CPTPP—would be another possible option for advancing the Blue Economy in the Asia-Pacific region. It is widely recognized that CPTPP has a series of novel and enforceable regulations concerning fishery sustainability. One of the CPTPP’s priorities is to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by placing a restriction on trade. In addition, CPTPP’s environmental chapter contains a binding dispute settlement mechanism. The final section is to refer to the European Union (hereinafter “EU”) model. The EU is a supranational and regional body with enforceable power. EU fishery regulations could be a model for the Asia-Pacific region in the sense of the substance of its rules. The EU has a more complex rule of regulating fishing and fisheries subsidies, such as the Regulation No. 508/2014 directing EU member states to use European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This article concludes that the CPTPP turns out to be a better policy choice for advancing the Blue Economy, in comparison with the APEC.

The problem for organizations with shipowners that have fishing boats older than 20 years is stated. Decision-making authorities face challenges nowadays. To be in the fleet for the next decade, shipowners for their ships should deploy energy efficiency projects for marine system retrofitting to improve energy efficiency and meet environmental regulations. The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan's development principles are discussed due to the current need for its deployment from 2021, so shipowners can contribute to the fast adoption of new regulations by the International Maritime Organization. In this work it is being offered to incorporate energy management issues with guidelines for upcoming regulations as well as those that are currently enforced. To improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental impact and cut fuel consumption costs, marine system retrofitting has been proposed. In this paper the focus is being put on studying energy management strengths and weaknesses which can lead to a qualitative understanding of the performance of the organizational structure, this work also focuses on the management settings concerning energy efficiency. If the organization wants to win by integrating energy policy, high-quality communication or promotion of energy efficiency issues should be employed.

We focus here on two emerging ocean sectors—blue carbon and ocean energy—and an evaluation of benefit-sharing agreements at operational sites, and the recipients and types of these benefits. This is an initial yet useful gauge of progress towards integration of social equity concerns as envisioned under a Blue Economy. The number (n = 84) and scale of ocean energy sites is rapidly increasing but highly concentrated in a few regions. The ocean energy sector is currently focused on serving grids in urbanized areas and reducing national emissions, and economic benefit-sharing mechanisms with local residents are less common (35% of all sites). However, some cases show how local communities can be better included in the planning and implementation of ocean energy, including negotiation of subsequent economic benefits. Despite widespread interest in blue carbon, we found very few (n = 4) operational sites; nonetheless, these were deeply involved with and often led by local communities who are the main beneficiaries. Voluntary public and corporate social responsibility actions are useful, but government regulation must play an essential role in requiring equitable processes and supporting equitable outcomes, similar to now-standard environmental regulations to avoid negative impacts and increase the likelihood of ecological sustainability. Emerging ocean sectors have a unique opportunity to advance social equity and environmental sustainability within Blue Economies, but this will be much more easily achieved if equity guidelines are prioritized and mandated so that business-as-usual practices do not become entrenched. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,neutral,Blue carbon",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106097,Carbon;Economic and social effects;Economics;Environmental regulations;Sustainable development;Benefit sharing;Blue economies;Carbon energy;Economic benefits;Energy sites;Local community;New industry;Ocean energy;Social equity;Toward integration;action plan;corporate social responsibility;economic structure;environmental economics;environmental management;guideline;prioritization;regulatory framework;sustainability;Oceanography,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106097,DOI(,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106097,DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106097) OR,,,,,

The European Union Green Deal represents a strategy towards a sustainable economic model. In this framework, land-based geothermics has seen very limited development; however, offshore geothermics is almost completely absent in the discussion on energy source alternatives, even though it represents a real challenge for energy transition, including the production of green hydrogen. This article discusses an excursus on the activities carried out on offshore geothermal areas worldwide. We focused on the energy potential capacity of the Marsili volcanic seamount located over the bathial plain of the Tyrrhenian Basin, describing the detailed geological, geochemical, and geophysical investigations that have been carried out on that seamount since the 2000s. All the collected data have shown evidence supporting the existence of an exploitable geothermal system in the Marsili seamount consisting of a reservoir of supercritical geothermal fluids of about 100 km3. We discuss and evaluate the actual consistence of the impacts associated with the occurrence of potential risks. We also describe the necessary further steps towards the pilot well. An important breakthrough in the short-medium term that allows for an exit from the predominance of fossil sources may come from the development of energy production derived from offshore high-enthalpy geothermal fields, especially in areas such as the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea.

The blue economy is sea-based. The economy of exploiting the vast resources of the oceans and their bottoms. This means that whatever is extracted from the sea if it is added to the country's economy, will fall into the category of the blue economy. But the amount of resources of Bangladesh at the Bay of Bengal (BoB) has not yet been surveyed properly. If the number of marine cetaceans can be known, then proper steps of marine management can be taken to protect marine mammals. This paper deals with detecting marine cetaceans based on various machine learning classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT) classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) around the Swatch of No Ground (SoNG) in the BoB. At first, the possible marine cetaceans living around the BoB has been listed for the training purpose of classification algorithms. Then the dataset (both training and validation or test) being trained to classification algorithms have been created by extracting spectrogram images of the clicks, whistles or songs of listed marine cetaceans around the SoNG. Three types of test data such as original test data (OTD), synthetic test data (STD) and practical test data (PTD) have considered validating the proposed method. The test data retrieved from the original dataset is the OTD. The STD and PTD have been derived from the OTD. Then these algorithms have been trained with the training sets selected from created dataset for the detection and classification of marine cetaceans. After completing the training process, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated with three types of test data and recorded the output to analyze the performance in detection and classification of marine cetaceans. The detection process will be very challenging as there is a lot of noise in the sea.

By 2025 the global market is estimated to reach USD $30.2 billion dollars (Bloomberg, Seaweed Cultivation Market worth $30.2 billion by 2025. Retrieved 06/08/2021, 2021, from , 2020). The current Australian seaweed market is valued at US$3 million, which is relatively small, contributing only 0.03% to the global market. However, the Blue Economy CRC and Marine Bioproducts CRC together have resulted in a public/private funding of nearly AUD $600 million over the past 3 years with the aim of expanding towards a billion-dollar seaweed market in Australia within the next decade. Furthermore, a recent CSIRO Data 61 report identified 'Microalgal and Macroalgal Resources' as an emerging growth sector, specifically in the state of Queensland (Naughtin et al., A New Chapter: Opportunities to seed new industries for Queensland over the coming decade. CSIRO and Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, pp 1-85, 2021). Currently, most of the seaweeds on the Australian market are imported, and this sector has seen a rapid expansion from 2005 to 2017. This growth highlights the increasing demand for seaweed products in Australia and potential for the expansion of domestic producers. International seaweed markets are also expanding rapidly at a rate of 12% and so offer significant export opportunities (IMARC, Seaweed Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2021-2026. Retrieved 06/08/2021, 2021, from, 2021). Despite the huge domestic biodiversity of seaweeds and their use by First Nations peoples, the commercialisation of native seaweed products has been limited. To date, seaweed cultivation and research has been broadly managed by the Department of Aquaculture and Marine Sciences, and more recently this has expanded to specific organisations (e.g. CSIRO, AgriFutures, ASI) and an increasing number of universities (e.g. the combined marine cooperative research centers (CRCs) have been approved for a total of AUD $580 million development over the next 10 years for marine bioproduct development and the blue economy with a consortium of ~100 industry, government and research partners). These collaborative networks with seaweed production companies provide evidence of a growing interest and demand for seaweed-based products in Australia and internationally. The two major seaweeds cultivated in Australia today comprise Durvillaea potatorum and Undaria pinnatifida. D. potatorum (commonly known as Bull Kelp) is a native brown seaweed species, which is collected primarily on King Island (Tasmania). Sustainable harvesting both generates an income of about AUD $2.63 million annually and helps preserve kelp forest ecosystems, motivating further research and sustainable cultivation. Both species are widely used to produce thickening agents for the food and cosmetics industry. In Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria there are currently a number of promising seaweed-based research projects developing seaweed-based products ranging from 3D bio-printing technology, livestock feed (methane emissions mitigation) and optimisation of seaweed mariculture systems. This chapter reviews current trends and future perspectives of seaweed-based products in the Australian market, highlighting the limitation of import and export restrictions and the importance of expanding investments into research on native strains. A growing domestic Australian seaweed industry not only offers to create regional jobs and reduce the cost of imports but has significant opportunities to become an export industry, extending value chains in the near future. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Planning and management are increasingly informed by qualitative and quantitative methods for assessing multi-sector interactions to identify trade-offs and synergies among sectors and with the environment, but there is a need to critically review the alignment of these tools with the requirements of Blue Economy stakeholders. Through a systematic literature review, an operational maturity analysis, and a survey of Blue Economy stakeholders, we found that the most well-developed tools for assessing interactions between multiple Blue Economy industries, and with the environment, are spatial prioritization tools, such as Marxan and multi-criteria decision support tools; and spatial static tools, such as cumulative effect mapping. More complex process/dynamic tools such as ecosystem and oceanographic models are well developed for single sectors, particularly water quality assessments and commercial fisheries, but have been less commonly applied in multi-sector contexts. Our review and stakeholder survey highlighted that assessing the environmental and operational suitability of sites for Blue Economy infrastructure in conjunction with operational impacts, trade-offs and decommissioning considerations requires: 1) a toolbox of approaches that covers a range of spatial, temporal and ecological scales; 2) tools that capture interactions and feedbacks among sectors, and with the environment, without being unnecessarily complicated (i.e., tractable to use and allow for effective communication of findings); and 3) continued synthesis of approaches and tools used across sectors such as commercial fishing, aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, and offshore engineering. © 2022 The Authors",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Tier 2 (Applications),10.1016/j.envsci.2022.03.016,Aquaculture;Multi-use platform;Offshore;Planning;Renewable energy;Sustainability;aquaculture;decision support system;economic aspect;ecosystem;fishery;fishing;human;maturity;renewable energy;review;synthesis;systematic review;water quality,,,10.1016/j.envsci.2022.03.016,DOI(,10.1016/j.envsci.2022.03.016,DOI(10.1016/j.envsci.2022.03.016) OR,,,,,

For the expansion of the seaweed farming in Bangladesh, a complete understanding of social and economic status of current farmers is important. However, information on socio-economic status of seaweed industry in Bangladesh is very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to understand existing culture methods and their cost, marketing channel and problems with seaweed farming in south east coast of Bangladesh. We used questionnaire survey and focus group discussions to collect data from seaweed farmers, researchers, local community and entrepreneurs. The study found that farmers are currently practicing long-line and horizontal net methods for the seaweed farming in the south east coastal region. The study also found that these culture methods are economically profitable. Seaweeds are currently sold locally and a proper value chain for seaweed marketing is still missing. Existing seaweed farmers are facing the problems related to insufficient credits for starting seaweed farming, lack of proper guidelines for farming and processing of harvested seaweed.

However, evidence supporting the idea that plans achieve-or are likely to achieve-these goals is limited. One gap in our understanding stems from questions surrounding the metrics against which MSP success is measured. Evaluation can be based on explicitly stated objectives, or might include metrics corresponding to broad social-ecological goals. This paper compares aspirational MSP goals gleaned from a literature review to the objectives extracted from 50+ finalized and implemented plans to better understand: (1) how well these two groupings align, and (2) in what ways any misalignment may shape MSP evaluation. Findings show that plans prioritize the environment, economy, and governance, while often excluding objectives related to cultural heritage, human well-being, Indigenous rights, human safety, and climate change. Social and cultural objectives have become more prevalent over time, yet overall stated objectives remain distinct from theorized MSP goals. As international efforts aim to expand MSP, narrowing the gap between how it is perceived and how its outcomes are evaluated is critical to better understanding what it is likely to achieve.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The discussion in this chapter proposes that the impacts of the MV Wakashio oil spill in July 2020 may be more complex and damaging than presently realised by the local population. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1007/978-3-030-99347-4_14,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Disasters;Wakefulness;Military Personnel,,,10.1007/978-3-030-99347-4_14,DOI(,,,,,,,

Biomass of marine origin, and especially seaweed, is a key element for blue growth and is expected to contribute to the development of the growing European blue economy. Several Research and Development and Research and Innovation Projects result in the establishment of an emerging seaweed aquaculture in the Northern European countries. However, macroalgal cultivation and bioprocessing is still scarce in the Mediterranean area, particularly in Tunisia, where seaweeds are abundant on its coast, they remain little exploited. Ongoing projects from different research institutes focus on biological activities of macroalgae, the extraction of active compounds, and the potential uses as phycocolloids, pigments, lipids, and bioactive metabolites characterization as well as bioproduct enhancement. The results of these investigations demonstrate that macroalgae from the Tunisian coasts are a source of valuable compounds and that they can be used as a natural renewable resource suitable for a large array of industrial applications. Further to this, specific research activities on seaweed cultivation have been conducted particularly for Gracilaria and Ulva. In this paper, we highlight the potential of the seaweed sector in Tunisia in terms of biodiversity, cultivation, and bioprocessing and discuss the challenges in various sectors, i.e., biology, building capacity, technology, or policy, that currently hinder the expansion of a sustainable Tunisian seaweed industry. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,aquaculture",10.1007/s10811-021-02579-w,Algae;Marine Biotechnology;Mediterranean;Seaweed;Sustainability;Tunisia,,,10.1007/s10811-021-02579-w,DOI(,10.1007/s10811-021-02579-w,DOI(10.1007/s10811-021-02579-w) OR,,,,,

This chapter addresses maritime security issues and challenges in SIDS in a general manner. It considers threats and risks associated with traditional national security, marine environment, economic development and human security, as well as the SIDS capacities and strategies to cope with their maritime security needs. Maritime security is thereby discussed in relation to blue economy, sustainable development, capacity-building and cooperation.

The goal of Bio-GO-SHIP is to produce systematic and consistent biological observations during global ocean repeat hydrographic surveys, with a particular focus on the planktonic ecosystem. Ocean plankton are an essential component of the earth climate system, form the base of the oceanic food web and thereby play an important role in influencing food security and contributing to the Blue Economy. Despite its importance, ocean biology is largely under-sampled in time and space compared to physical and chemical properties. This lack of information hampers our ability to understand the role of plankton in regulating biogeochemical processes and fueling higher trophic levels, now and in future ocean conditions. Traditionally, many of the methods used to quantify biological and ecosystem essential ocean variables (EOVs), measures that provide valuable information on the ecosystem, have been expensive and labor- and time-intensive, limiting their large-scale deployment. In the last two decades, new technologies have been developed and matured, making it possible to greatly expand our biological ocean observing capacity. These technologies, including cell imaging, bio-optical sensors and 'omic tools, can be combined to provide overlapping measurements of key biological and ecosystem EOVs. New developments in data management and open sharing can facilitate meaningful synthesis and integration with concurrent physical and chemical data. Here we outline how Bio-GO-SHIP leverages these technological advances to greatly expand our knowledge and understanding of the constituents and function of the global ocean plankton ecosystem.

Fish, rich in micronutrients, have potential for improving the nutritional status of coastal and riparian communities, particularly in the Global South where inadequate nutrition is prevalent. Yet, the potential for fish to alleviate malnutrition remains limited to policy documents and high-level government commitments. We propose an agenda for NSG in the Global South grounded in three main pillars: 1-extending the boundaries of fisheries governance, 2-integrating multiple forms of knowledge, and 3-prioritizing domestic and local needs; each of these pillars links different levels of governance starting at the level of conceptualization and images connected to what fisheries are and should do, to a more policy-oriented level with hands-on recommendations, through an intermediate level that links the two. Overall, we propose a concept and agenda for NSG grounded in a human-centred approach to fisheries governance with social sciences playing a crucial role in unearthing the nodes of power that limit access and agency of poor and vulnerable (fishing) communities to the nutritional benefits of fish. In doing so, we critically analyze dominant fisheries governance agendas (‘Blue Economy’, ‘Blue Growth’) through the lens of food and nutrition security and anchor these debates to the objective of getting the right nutrients to those who need them most. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries",10.1007/s11160-022-09743-6,Fisheries governance;Global South;Nutrition and food security,,,10.1007/s11160-022-09743-6,DOI(,10.1007/s11160-022-09743-6,DOI(10.1007/s11160-022-09743-6) OR,,,,,

Goals differ between regions and countries, though establishing and maintaining the health of the oceans is consistently at the core. Blue economy agenda incorporate several prongs, for example, fisheries and aquaculture; renewable ocean energy; seaports and shipping; offshore hydrocarbons and seabed minerals; and tourism. Healthy oceans and indeed abundantly stocked oceans ensures food security, particularly when reliance on fisheries as the main source of protein is expected to rise in the future. Fisheries security is directly affected by illegal fishing. To ensure current stocks are managed and declining stocks once again thrive, global, regional, and domestic regulatory efforts must seek to eliminate illegal fishing. Though, the problem does not end when fish are landed at the port. Globally inconsistent labeling regulations may provide opportunity for unsustainable and illegally caught fish to be distributed, processed and potentially exported, failing Sustainable Development Goals 2 (zero hunger) and 14 (life below the water). Due to inadequate labeling, consumers purchasing fish and fish products may lack critical information that could reduce demand of declining fish stocks, or catches that employ damaging methods. As such, greater transparency and consistency is needed in fish labeling to ensure consumers can make sustainable and environmentally responsible choices. While consumers are increasingly making sustainable choices, inadequate labeling laws and policies fail to inform these choices.

Therefore, identifying the potential and parameters that can accelerate the optimization of natural resources is needed to achieve profitable growth. By using a quantitative approach through the Generalized Method of Moments System (GMM-SYS) estimator, this study processed six secondary data such as poverty (POV), investment (IV), government expenditure (GOVEX), fisheries total production (TP), Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), employment (LABOR), and net export (EXPORT) in Natuna Regency from 2010 to 2020. This study aims to comprehend the variables that can help raise the standard of living of the people in Natuna Regency through econometric analysis of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, the discussion related to these variables is reinforced with a blue economy standpoint to provide an overview of how the economic variable strengthens the people's economic stability in the Natuna Regency while preserving nature. The present study found that investment has the most significant influence on poverty alleviation in the long term, where a 1% percent increase in investment will reduce poverty by 0.675%. On the other hand, a 1% increase in total production, GRDP, and labor can reduce poverty by 0.026%, 0.065%, and 0.053%, respectively. The key to rigorous development is the coordination of all parameters that can back up, boost, and serve each other in economic development aspects. Therefore, it is highly recommended for Natuna Regency local government to focus on macroeconomic variables, specifically the investments, in fighting poverty in Natuna Regency while also taking into consideration a sustainable manner when optimizing the impending investment. © 2022, BIOFLUX SRL.

This started in 2007 though the European Union Integrated Maritime Policy approach, and in 2009 the Africa Union initiated a similar process, leading both to the Africa integrated maritime strategy as well as a blue economy strategy. Several countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, began to look to blue economy as a booster to socioeconomic welfare and initiated the development of national strategies, together with the nec-essary adaptation of institutional and legal networks. Case studies address those processes at the transition from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans, focusing on Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Kenya in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, as well as several African Small Islands Developing States (SIDS), particularly Cape Verde, S. Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, Madagascar and Mauritius. Findings show that all countries covered in the case studies are developing national ocean and/or blue economy strategies and adapting their governmental, institutional, and legal frameworks, although there is a deeper political impact in SIDS.

Often such a WEC is deployed in an ocean location with tidal currents or ocean streams, or serves as a mobile platform to power the blue economy. The shape of the floating body, or buoy, of the point absorber type WEC is important for the wave energy capture ratio and for the current drag force. In this paper, a new approach to optimize the shape of the point absorber buoy is developed to reduce the ocean current drag force on the buoy while capturing more energy from ocean waves. A specific parametric modelling is constructed to define the shape of the buoy with 12 parameters. The implantation of neural networks significantly reduces the computational time compared with solving hydrodynamics equations for each iteration. And the optimal shape of the buoy is solved using a genetic algorithm with multiple self-defined functions. The final optimal shape of the buoy in a case study reduces 68.7% of current drag force compared to a cylinder-shaped buoy, while maintaining the same level of energy capture ratio from ocean waves. The method presented in this paper has the capability to define and optimize a complex buoy shape, and solve for a multi-objective optimization problem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

However, often these MPA’s are no more than Paper Parks, with poor financial and human resources, thus lacking effectiveness. Moreover, they frequently trigger conflicts with local communities, by imposing restrictions to their activities with no alternative or compensations, causing serious governance inefficiencies. Thus, within the UN Oceans Decade, MPA’s must face simultaneously three of the challenges: Protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity (Challenge 2); Develop a sustainable and equitable ocean economy (Challenge 4) and Change humanity’s relationship with the ocean (Challenge 10). To address those challenges, it becomes clear that management models of MPA’s had to find ways to value natural capital and, at the same time, involve local communities and stakeholders in the governance processes. The conservation of biodiversity has both direct and indirect economic benefits for many sectors of the economy, namely tourism, being ecotourism considered one of the segments particularly adequate to value natural capital. Ecotourism, defined as “environmentally responsible travel and visitation to relatively undisturbed natural areas”, to enjoy and appreciate nature, is often used to enhance the natural capital, while protecting and promoting protected areas. Several studies have been carried out about ecotourism in MPA’s all over the world, particularly in the 21st century. In this article, we analyzed several case studies focusing ecotourism in MPAs, to better understand the connection between the development of this industry, the development of sustainable blue economy, and the efforts for ocean conservation. From the analysis conducted, we conclude that ecotourism development and community participation are of paramount importance in achieving sustainable development in MPAs, although there is still room to new advances improving good marine governance.

The existing sectors are utilizing technological innovation such as marine aquaculture, technologies for exploration and decommission of offshore oil and gas platforms, ballast wastewater management technologies, oil spill management technologies, digital navigation and sea traffic management, and biotechnology. The studies indicated that the presence of these technologies has a positive impact on growth of blue economy sectors. However, the South Asian region still lacks major breakthroughs in investment when it comes to technologies such as satellite sensors and imagery techniques for exploration and management, big data, information technologies, and digitalization for improving port services and advancement in biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies.

Since then, various international bodies started promoting the concept to build up strategies for protecting and preserving priceless ocean resources. However, initially, this new term was often confusingly used to mean “ocean economy” or “marine economy.” To remove the ambiguity of these words, the UN in 2014 came up with an exclusive definition of blue economy. This chapter seeks to explore the challenges and opportunities of the blue economy. To identify the scope of the blue economy in line with the restoration and protection of ecosystem services and UN’s SDGs, this chapter provides some substantial evidence to increase the concept of ocean ecosystem services and reduce the anthropogenic impact on the ocean ecosystem.

The rapid degradation of aquatic ecosystems and the depletion of their resource base due to an increase in environmental and economic burden inevitably have an impact on the well-being and health of people living in coastal countries. With the increase in the scale of oceanic fishing, there was a growing understanding of the need to study and preserve the living resources of the oceans. This was facilitated by a number of objective factors and, above all, the desire of all States involved in the exploitation of aquatic biological resources to create conditions for the sustainable, maximum possible, rational use of these resources. In order to preserve living marine resources for most areas of the world Ocean, including in the Atlantic, international legal acts have been prepared and signed. As a result, international fishing organizations were created for almost every district: fishing commissions, scientific councils, scientific committees, etc. The main task for our country in the research and extraction of aquatic biological resources of the Atlantic Ocean in modern conditions is to protect the interests of optimal Russian fishing at the international level. This is possible by evaluating aquatic biological resources on a strict scientific basis and developing recommendations for their rational use, taking into account the Concept of the “blue economy”, the requirements of international conventions and bilateral treaties. In total, in the oceanic regions of the Atlantic, the domestic fleet can annually extract about 1.0 million tons of aquatic biological resources without damage to the oceanic ecosystem. In addition, it should be borne in mind that there is a promising reserve—possible fishing of Antarctic krill up to 5.5 million tons annually. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Tier 2 (Applications),10.1007/978-3-031-08284-9_10,Aquatic bioresources;Oceanic fishing;The Atlantic ocean;The concept of the “blue economy”;Economic and social effects;Economics;Fisheries;Marine biology;Oceanography;Sustainable development;Aquatic bioresource;Biological resources;Bioresource;Blue economies;Condition;Sustainable economic development;The atlantic ocean;Aquatic ecosystems,,,10.1007/978-3-031-08284-9_10,DOI(,10.1007/978-3-031-08284-9_10,DOI(10.1007/978-3-031-08284-9_10) OR,,,,,

This work is timely, as Blue Economy activities account for a significant share of GDPs in the island and coastal economies in the Asia region, sustaining the livelihoods of one of the largest sections of the world’s population. This book, therefore, assesses how the Blue Economy contributes to these livelihoods from economic and ecological perspectives and analyzes the various types of ecosystem services provided, and how these services are regulated and maintained. While most studies of the Blue Economy focus only on the economic aspects, this book provides ample statistical data to demonstrate why ecosystem services should additionally be considered for the estimation and valuation of the Blue economy. The book is primarily meant for researchers, students, and teachers in the fields of environmental and ocean economics, sustainable development, and ecosystem services, and will be of further interest to policymakers and government officials working in matters related to the Blue Economy and sustainability policy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE)",10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8,Asian economy;Blue carbon;Blue economy;Fisheries;Marine biotechnology;Marine ecosystem services;Ocean conservation;Ocean sustainability;Asian Continental Ancestry Group,,,10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8,DOI(,10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8,DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8) OR,,,,,

Definitions of the ‘bioeconomy’ vary but in general it incorporates the ways in which societies manage and distribute their primary or secondary biological resources for further use in everyday life (e.g. food, materials, and energy). The classical sectors related to the bioeconomy have therefore been agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, now extended to include bioenergy, biofuels, biochemicals, and other processing and service industries. There are also related new concepts such us the blue economy, the green economy, and the circular economy. This book integrates these definitions, sectoral analyses and new concepts into a fully rounded study of the bioeconomy. It is argued that the key aims in the coming years have to be the harmonization of public policies between different sectors, regulation of legislative framework for the bioeconomy, and clear communication of these issues. In particular, the book argues that a strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the bioeconomy on society is an essential starting point. For this to be effective, appropriate indicators need to be established and defined for the monitoring of the effects of these resilient policies related to bioeconomy and their impact on local and regional development and quality of life.

The marine plastic debris (MPD) has thus become one of the emerging global environmental and public health problems drawing enormous international attention recently. This article observes that international agreements do not provide sufficient and proper governance mechanisms to address plastic marine debris problems specifically. In preventing the MPD from land-based sources, a well-designed waste management legal and institutional framework with effective implementation shall be established. In this regard, Part I first explores the main features, challenges, and effectiveness of existing international legal norms aims at marine pollution prevention. In Part II, the effectiveness of the plastic waste management legal and policy framework adopted at the international level will be evaluated and critically discussed.

It is worth to explore Taiwan's waste management law and policy framework and its implementation experience partially because Taiwan's experience could provide some lessons for emerging industrial countries to reduce and to dispose of plastic waste effectively. This article finds that the key to address MPD relies on effective plastic waste management globally.

Starting from a definition of “ocean governance,” we highlight that two fundamentally different regulatory approaches are applied to the ocean: a spatial ordering on the one hand and a sectoral segmentation on the other. States are the central actors regulating the use and protection of marine areas, but state sovereignty is stratified, with diminishing degrees of authority farther from the shoreline. As vast marine spaces are beyond the exclusive control of any given territorial state, political authority beyond areas of national jurisdiction must first be created to enable collective decision‐making. Consequently, a multitude of authorities regulate human activities in the ocean, producing overlaps, conflicting policies, and gaps. Based on recent contributions to the fast‐growing ocean governance research field, we provide a thematic overview structured along the dimensions of maritime security, protection of the marine environment, and economics to unveil patterns of authority in ocean governance. © 2022 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.17645/pag.v10i3.5334,authority;blue economy;coordination;marine environmental protection;maritime security;ocean governance,,,10.17645/pag.v10i3.5334,DOI(,,,,,,,

This paper examines the regionally relevant institutional arrangements that frame and execute ocean development and governance within CARICOM. It finds that while some important sectors, such as fisheries and tourism, have specific organizations established geared toward regional coordination in management of those activities, others, including offshore oil and gas, marine scientific research, and port and shipping development, lack similar arrangements. Additionally, the CARICOM group lags in adopting a holistic, ecosystem approach to ocean management with siloed approaches dominating and few formal mechanisms for intersectoral coordination existing. This paper advocates for and proposes means toward increased integration at a regional level for the management and continued governance of the marine space, its associated resources and activities.

In the long term, important marine habitats need to be designated as marine protected areas and prevent destructive man-made activities through appropriate legislation and law enforcement to promote marine resource conservation and ecological protection. Furthermore, marine protected areas have been recognized as the simplest, cheapest and most effective way in which to restore fishery resources and protect marine biodiversity in the future. However, the competent authorities have been unable to achieve co-management of the environment and partnerships for many years, and continue to rely on extensive integration and collaboration between governments and non-governmental organizations or individuals due to implementation-related factors such as the island society, the multiple social relationships of fishermen or residents in fishing villages, the closely related place attachment, and general xenophobia. The National Penghu University of Science and Technology established marine protected area community patrols in 2018. The patrols not only protect marine resources but also allow community residents and fishermen to build consensus among communities and reduce class discrimination against fishermen, which is in line with the sustainable planning and management strategy in fisheries of the blue economy and with the spirit of sato-umi. Sato-umi is a coastal area where biological productivity and biodiversity has increased through human interaction.

Inflatable absorbers have the potential to significantly decrease shipping, installation, and structural materials costs when compared with rigid structures, but their performance has not been thoroughly investigated for realistic materials and with fluid-flexible structure interaction. In this paper we use a generalized modes approach for the flexible-inflatable rubber absorbers to see how adding structural flexibility affects performance. The modal mass and stiffness matrices and natural mode shapes of each flexible absorber are found using the ANSYS Structural package, after an initial inflation pressure prestress step. These values are then input into WAMIT, a linear potential flow solver, to find the hydrodynamic coefficients for the six rigid body modes and additional flexible modes. A time-domain model for the rigid and flexible WECs is developed in WEC-SIM, which uses the generalized mode hydrodynamics with a simple spring and damper power take-off (PTO) system to predict power performance for regular wave and irregular wave cases. The PTO is optimized from a discrete set to maximize power absorption or keep forces below 10 kN. The analyses show that adding structural flexibil-ity can improve average power absorption (-1% to +8%) but also lead to larger PTO forces (up to 15%), with differences depending on sea state parameters. The results also suggest that a rigid absorber can be replaced by an inflatable with the same PTO system at this scale and the power performance will not be affected. By analyzing these different scenarios, device developers and potential marine energy customers will have a better understanding of the feasibility of using inflatable absorbers for many of the differing applications that make up the growing blue economy. © 2022 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

It was a limited study designed to summarize practical options for repurposing. The conclusions list those areas where further modeling or studies are warranted and required with the objective being to build an integrated modeling tool to assist companies, government agencies, and NGO's in assessing the benefits and risks for repurposing specific facilities. 30CFR 585J can be used to expedite permitting the deployment of renewable energy in the Gulf of Mexico. This regulation specifically is written to allow addition of renewable energy and other marine activities on to existing oil and gas leases and is written broadly enough it can be applied to other Blue Economy activities. For the transition to occur the current policy of removing non-producing assets must be stopped. These facilities, providing they are still in good repair, can be a tremendous asset that can accelerate the decarbonization of the Gulf Coast Region, and become the basis for an industrial transition that will create more employment and value than even the peak of offshore oil and gas. The Gulf of Mexico has an excellent offshore renewable energy potential. NREL places the total Gross Resource available at 2000GW and the Technical (recoverable) resource at 500GW. Neither value includes geothermal, and because of the conservative way the NREL calculates the resources the actual potential is at least twice as large. The DOE study, summarized in this paper, provides detailed answer to the following questions: • What is the potential value of legacy platforms, wells, and pipelines to renewable energy and Blue Economy activities? • What renewable energy systems are economically viable in the Gulf of Mexico and can be deployed safely on existing leases? • What Blue Economy industries can be facilitated by using legacy assets in the Gulf of Mexico? • Who can apply for and what is the process for repurposing existing assets or adding new assets to existing leases? • What are the benefits to the current owners, the Gulf Coast Region, and environment?

Utilizing generic frequency domain representations of the Oscilla Power Triton WEC and spectral wave conditions at PacWave (Oregon), Los Angeles (California) and WETS (Hawaii), a series of interesting results emerge. Firstly, the ‘optimal’ WEC size, from an energy standpoint, is fundamentally dependent on the frequency distribution of the incoming wave variance density spectrum. Secondly, and from a seasonality perspective, the seasonal WEC energy generation doesn’t necessarily follow the seasonal distribution of gross wave power. Finally, from an hourly power variability perspective, a reduction in WEC size generally decreases variability. However, for each of the locations investigated, there appears to be a WEC size threshold; a threshold where further reducing WEC size results in increased power variability. © 2022, European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference.

Seaweed research has focused mainly on the identification and taxonomic distribution of 628 species identified so far, mainly in the Caribbean Sea. Among the most widely cultivated genera of seaweeds in open-sea pilot systems in Colombia are Hydropuntia, Gracilaria, Hypnea, Kappaphycus, and Eucheuma. These genera have shown low yields as a consequence of high tissue fragility, epiphytism, sedimentation, and nitrogen deficiency. In addition, the evaluation of the biological activity of selected seaweed compounds has advanced considerably, focusing on their composition and their use for direct consumption by humans and animals. Despite the diversity of seaweeds, as well as certain technical and scientific advances, Colombia is still lagging behind other countries in seaweed exploitation, both in Latin America and worldwide. This current status raises the need to increase research, technological (agro-tech) appropriation, and the adoption of effective public policies that will boost algal businesses.

These instruments set the obligations and guidance for national action of participating countries. Legal and policy responses by governments provide an opportunity to address the many drivers of marine litter across the life cycle, from the design of products to the management of the waste they generate. Public awareness, consumer behaviour and industry engagement also play key roles in preventing marine litter. These interventions alone remain voluntary, fragmented and insufficient to tackle the marine litter problem. The national and/or regional responsibility of parties to prevent marine litter as established by these frameworks is not unique to the countries of Africa, and many of the barriers to effective compliance are shared with developing countries in other regions. The social context in which national implementation measures must operate can be unique to countries or regions. This chapter summarises the duties established by the legal and policy frameworks at the international and regional levels that may be applied to the issue of marine litter. It provides an African context to the barriers and drivers of effective implementation of national measures in compliance with international obligations. The scope of this chapter extends beyond the responsibility to prevent marine pollution, to establish a holistic and integrated duty of governments to provide a healthy environment and sustainable livelihoods as recognised in the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This information is based on a wide range of ocean observations using different systems and approaches. An integrated approach thus requires effective collaboration between areas of expertise in order to improve coordination at each step of the ocean observing value chain, from the design and deployment of multi-platform observations to their analysis and the delivery of products, sometimes through data assimilation in numerical models. Despite significant advances over the last two decades in more cooperation across the ocean observing activities, this integrated approach has not yet been fully realized. The ocean observing system still suffers from organizational silos due to independent and often disconnected initiatives, the strong and sometimes destructive competition across disciplines and among scientists, and the absence of a well-established overall governance framework. Here, we address the need for enhanced organizational integration among all the actors of ocean observing, focusing on the occidental systems. We advocate for a major evolution in the way we collaborate, calling for transformative scientific, cultural, behavioral, and management changes. This is timely because we now have the scientific and technical capabilities as well as urgent societal and political drivers. The ambition of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030) and the various efforts to grow a sustainable ocean economy and effective ocean protection efforts all require a more integrated approach to ocean observing. After analyzing the barriers that currently prevent this full integration within the occidental systems, we suggest nine approaches for breaking down the silos and promoting better coordination and sharing. These recommendations are related to the organizational framework, the ocean science culture, the system of recognition and rewards, the data management system, the ocean governance structure, and the ocean observing drivers and funding. These reflections are intended to provide food for thought for further dialogue between all parties involved and trigger concrete actions to foster a real transformational change in ocean observing.

One such area is the harvesting of living resources, which requires different processes involving manual material handling. One such process is loading large quantities of crates filled with fish and ice to the truck. Repetitive work involving heavy lifting and bending results in the development of musculoskeletal disorders among the workers. The purpose of this study is to identify the health risks involved in this occupation and ultimately aid in the direction of improving the lives of the workers. Nordic questionnaire, Dutch Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (DMQ) and observation study was used to identify musculoskeletal disorders and potential work hazards the workers are exposed to in the fishing industry. A total of 30 workers were selected for this study. In total, 84% reported complaints in Lower back, 76% complaints in shoulders, and 89.6% of the workers reported complaints in Wrist during the past 12 months. Among all workers, 45% visited a physician at least once, and 30% took at least one period of sick leave. The potential work hazards were found to be repeated motion, work involving bending, lifting and wet and cold grip. Working conditions involving cold and wet grip and repeated lifting and bending motions for long hours are important risk factors for the development of MSDs among the workers working in the fish crates loading process, and thus these risks have to be eliminated with effective intervention in this area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1007/978-3-030-94277-9_49,Blue economy;Fisheries;Manual material handling;Musculoskeletal disorders;Health Resources,,,10.1007/978-3-030-94277-9_49,DOI(,,,,,,,

The European Commission has through the Blue Growth objectives for the first time highlighted marine sectors as unique market opportunities with high growth potential which carry socio-economic importance to the development of coastal regions. Particularly marine sectors such as aquaculture, marine robotics, and marine renewable energy which fulfil global needs in food safety and security, enable monitoring and exploration in harsh and remote conditions, and globally growing energy needs were recognized as catalysts to achieve sustainable development. Marine start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) were identified as potential drivers in emerging marine sectors. However, they require support mechanisms tailored to their needs as they are competing for the same business and financial support as land-based SMEs, yet the research and development infrastructure is more difficult to access.ProtoAtlantic, an Interreg Atlantic Area funded project, provided marine-specific support mechanisms to marine start-ups and SMEs in emerging sectors, including business support through the accelerator and mentorship programs, enabling companies to fast track their product development through access to prototyping and testing facilities in all partner regions. The Interreg Atlantic Area encompasses partner regions in France, Ireland, Portugal, Scotland, and Spain. The consortium partners consist of Technopôle Brest Iroise (Brest, France), University College Cork - UCC (Cork, Ireland), County Council Cork (Cork, Ireland), INESC TEC (Porto, Portugal), the European Marine Energy Centre - EMEC (Orkney, Scotland), EMERGE (Canary Islands, Spain), and the lead partner, Innovalia Association (Canary Islands, Spain). The strategic collaboration between the partners provided marine start-ups access to testing facilities in the Atlantic Ocean. The extreme living laboratories provided by EMEC, the LiR National Ocean Testing Facilities at UCC's Centre of Marine and Renewable Energy (MaREI centre), and INESC TEC promise harsh real-life conditions which test the suitability of marine technologies to the limit thereby providing start-ups and SMEs with an extra layer of confidence in developing their technologies. This cross-regional collaboration puts the ProtoAltantic program in a unique position, as it is the first of its kind to dedicate marine-specific support to marine start-ups and SMEs which have benefited from the opportunities that ProtoAtlantic has provided.ProtoAtlantic developed a holistic model for the prototyping and exploitation of innovative ideas in emerging maritime sectors. After the identification of ideas from the research community, start-ups, and SMEs with product innovation capacity in the maritime sector, an acceleration program with a normed and structured process was implemented, thus creating a unique ecosystem in the Atlantic that is addressing a co-creation paradigm with the local European start-ups communities and all the stakeholders. © 2022 IEEE.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE)",10.1109/OCEANSChennai45887.2022.9775476,acceleration program;blue growth;prototyping;regional economic development sustainable development;sustainable blue economy;Coastal zones;Economic and social effects;Economics;Energy resources;Marine biology;Marine engineering;Oceanography;Planning;Regional planning;Test facilities;Acceleration program;Blue economies;Blue growth;Ireland;Marine sector;Prototyping;Regional economic development;Regional economic development sustainable development;Sustainable blue economy;Testing facility;Sustainable development;Military Personnel,,,10.1109/OCEANSChennai45887.2022.9775476,DOI(,10.1109/OCEANSChennai45887.2022.9775476,DOI(10.1109/OCEANSChennai45887.2022.9775476) OR,,,,,

Increased global atmospheric emission of CO2 has increased its concentration in the ocean due to dissolution and absorption of atmospheric CO2, leading to ocean acidification. This further affects the coral reefs and other calcifiers such as Pteropods (marine snails), shellfish (clams, etc.), crustaceans (shrimp and lobsters), starfish, sea urchins, and their kin (echinoderms) and interferes with the marine food web and leads to food shortages thereby affecting the socio-economic lives of the people living in the coastal area. To quantify the above impacts and to study other biochemical variations in the ocean, it is necessary to monitor ocean acidification for a longer time period. Current methods for monitoring ocean acidification employ gliders, drifters, buoys, mooring, and periodic testing of samples collected during research voyages. These methods are often not cost-effective, time-efficient, requires a lot of manpower, and provides inferior spatio-temporal resolution. This research work analyzes the existing ocean acidification data collected from the ALOHA station at the North Pacific Ocean and propose a predictive model at the edge level by using Regression to reduce the effective cost of the IoT system. The proposed regression model is also used to design a novel IoT architecture for designing an energy-efficient, near real-time ocean acidification monitoring model. The proposed IoT hardware can be deployed by using buoys and fishing boats to further reduce the monitoring cost and increase the spatio-temporal resolution of the data compared to the existing monitoring systems.  © 2022 IEEE.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Tier 2 (Applications),10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985728,Blue economy;Edge Computing;Internet of Things(IoT);Machine learning;Near-Real-time monitoring;Ocean acidification;Sustainable development Goal(SDG);Acidification;Carbon dioxide;Climate change;Cost effectiveness;Cost reduction;Edge computing;Energy efficiency;Green computing;Oceanography;Regression analysis;Shellfish;Atmospheric emission;Blue economies;Coral reef;Machine-learning;Monitoring system;Near-real-time monitoring;Ocean acidifications;Spatio-temporal resolution;Sustainable development goal;Internet of things,,,10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985728,DOI(,10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985728,DOI(10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985728) OR,,,,,

The objective of this paper is to provide a methodological framework for analysing the economic performance of selected blue sectors, suggesting additional information for the development of cross-border cooperation in two neighbouring countries: Estonia and Finland. The analysis of the economic performance of the selected blue sectors relies on the Amadeus database for both countries, the implementation of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and the calculation of partial productivity measures. The results of the study show that, on average, blue sectors report good performance indicators in coastal regions, but there are also some signs of imperfect efficiency. The common pattern of imperfectly efficient blue sectors in both countries is due to an excess of some fixed assets, which convey extra costs for business activities and, to some extent, generate excessive environmental pressures. The special nature of a shared blue economic area between Estonia and Finland stipulates close cross-border cooperation as an important tool to improve the performance of the imperfectly efficient sectors through shared “best practice” opera-tions, technologies, and infrastructures.

Figures show a high value but there are major differences between studies. Notwithstanding this, their importance is clear. It is also clear that the trend is for a decline in most ecosystem services derived from such ecosystems in spite of higher levels of exploitation, because of the degradation to the ecosystems in many locations. The causes of the degradation are over exploitation, misuse of the marine biomes as a waste sink, conversion of coastal systems, and loss of habitat and climate change. This degradation is not inevitable and can be reversed. A key role in doing so is to estimate the costs and benefits of marine-related activities and the incorporation of those costs in setting regulations and designing policies to manage the marine environment. The chapter has reviewed a range of instruments, to see how they can help to move the use of these ecosystems towards a more sustainable use. At present, while there are some developments that indicate a shift in a more encouraging direction, we also have government interventions, particularly some subsidies that are harmful to the marine environment. There is also a greater need to increase cooperation in setting regulations that apply across extra-territorial jurisdictions. Finally, management in this area has to take account not only of the overall costs and benefits of different interventions, but also pay special attention to the way in which they impact on the many vulnerable groups that depend on marine resources for their livelihoods.

The potential for implementing the Blue Economy in Indonesia is very wide open. The Blue Economy is a way of thinking about development that is based on the economic value of Indonesia's marine resources. This adds value to the supply chain, directly or indirectly, and could improve people's lives. However, we know that fishermen have a weak bargaining position in selling their fish catch, sometimes sold through mediators/bonded money systems or directly at fish auctions/TPI without going through an auction. Because of this, fishermen and fishermen's cooperatives need an open-source software application to help them track and report their finances, such as the number of fish caught, sales, loans (debt), expenses, and profits. This study aims to show an application called Electronic Fish Solution that can keep track of and report on entities and business processes in fishermen's cooperatives and fishing businesses. This research develops a prototype of a fishing trading application to make it easier for fishers to market their catch. In software development, the research method is based on prototyping and testing usability with the UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

The activities of the so-called blue economy can go from applications such as offshore maritime wind farms to ocean environment monitoring, which are supported by sensed platforms such Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) that require the use of reliable underwater communications. Currently, there is no suitable solution that is able to combine long-range and broadband underwater communications. The integration of different technologies, namely acoustics, RF, and optical on a multimodal approach, has been considered a suitable solution to overcome the limitations caused by the water propagation medium. Since missions at the ocean are usually expensive and demand large human and technological resources, it is important to have accurate simulation platforms for these multimodal underwater wireless networks. This paper presents the first version of a novel simulation framework - MultiUWSim (Beta) -, built upon ns-3, which integrates multiple communications technologies (RF, acoustics and optical). The current version of the simulation platform offers the possibility of simulating acoustic-based and radio-based physical wireless interfaces in a single node in a ns-3 simulation environment, enabling fully-customizable underwater network simulations.  © 2022 IEEE.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9976963,Autonomous underwater vehicles;Autonomous vehicles;Offshore oil well production;Vehicle to vehicle communications;Wind power;Blue economies;Flexible simulation;Multi-modal;Offshores;Optical-;Simulation platform;Suitable solutions;Underwater communication;Wind farm;Wireless communications,,,10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9976963,DOI(,,,,,,,

Academics highlight emerging uncertainties for small-scale fisheries. The review points out differences between small-scale and industrial-scale fisheries, particularly the social aspects that could make small-scale fisheries more suitable for achieving some of the stated goals of a blue economy.

Caribbean countries routinely suffer major losses of life, internal social and economic displacement, increased debt burdens, and significant economic damages due to hurricanes and ecological disasters in the context of an ongoing fiscal crisis. In response, regional public and national agencies have proposed “blue economy” initiatives to address the regional need for finance, to rejuvenate financial flows, and to compensate for extremely constrained fiscal resources and externally imposed austerity (or debt bondage). Major recent hurricanes and ecological shocks illustrate uneven and interconnected spatial histories of anti-Black dispossession, disenfranchisement, and deprivation, offering important empirical terrain from which to appreciate how contemporary ‘disasters’ have become new means to extend hierarchical plantation formations to the seascape through debt-driven finance and austerity. The paper demonstrates the ways in which coercive financial instruments like catastrophe insurance, debt swaps, ‘blue bonds’, and traditional public debt constitute tools to further integrate these societies differentially into racialised financial geographies and entrench a coloniality of being. As traditional plantation structures become exhausted and lack capacity to effectively ensure growth, these innovative finance mechanisms are required for “blue” accumulation. We situate spiralling debt burdens and these new instruments spurred by socially produced and postcolonial disasters within postplantation ecologies that describe socio-political relations and spatial dependencies linked to interwoven logics of disaster-based financial capitalism that seek to extend the extractive capacity of the plantation anew. These arrangements tend to naturalise and render disaster, death, and debt as ordinary events and obligations arising from postcolonial statehood, and take for granted their origins in racialised plantation structures.

However, development, since 1971, of a ship repair and dismantlement industry on the shores of the Bay has degraded its archaeological value, marred the sea vista with cranes and other industrial equipment, and polluted the Bay's waters. A solution to these problems has, so far, evaded the national authorities. With coastal tourism being the largest component of the Greek blue economy, the lost opportunity cost of archaeological tourism around the Bay is significant.

However, their ability to supply natural goods and services depends on how well marine resources and their biodiversity are conserved. In South Asia, the conservation of these resources and their biodiversity is far from ideal. This is because socioeconomic factors are unfavourable to the adoption of measures required to conserve these resources adequately. As is explained, this is common in low-income countries such as those in South Asia. Marine protected areas are mainly established to prevent the over-harvesting of resources, but sometimes they are completely protected from harvesting activities. They are one of the means available to help conserve marine biodiversity. The comparative extent to which Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have established marine protected areas is outlined, and their management of these areas is discussed. However, over-harvesting of marine resources is not the only threat to marine resources. Marine pollution is also a threat to their biodiversity and to their sustainable and efficient use. The extent and nature of marine pollution in South Asian maritime areas are investigated with particular attention being given to plastic wastes.

Yet there are significant empirical and conceptual barriers to establishing a well-functioning and robust system of maritime security governance. First, the question remains open whether the high seas are intractably anarchical or potentially susceptible to a strong system of institutionalised governance. Second, maritime space itself resists a binary assessment of the existence or absence of security governance given the range of maritime spaces and their treatment in international law. Third, the securitisation process is not uniform spatially, a condition circumscribing the number of global maritime public security goods requiring collective action. The blue economy constitutes a fourth complication: some littoral states treat the “blue economy” as a problem of managing common-pool resources in order to maximise the extraction of ocean resources without depleting those (renewable) resources, whereas for others, the over-exploitation or fouling of the “blue economy” represents an existential threat to national food security. These potential barriers to maritime security governance raise five questions: What maritime domains are threatened and what are the nature of those threats? What are the necessary conditions requiring an effective system of MSG to emerge? What are the components of a system of MSG? Does the current governance system meet the criteria defining a system of security governance?

Despite the environmental, social, and economic impacts, sargassum is a valuable source for multiple uses at the industry, such as alginates, cosmetics, recycled paper and bioplastics, fertilizers, and as raw material for civil construction. This work presents a systematic literature review on the use of algae at the civil construction sector, with a focus on the valorization of the pelagic Sargassum spp. biomass, by identifying the potential applications related to the use of other algal species. The review considered other genera of marine algae and marine angiosperms, resulting in a total of 31 selected articles. The marine grass Posidonia oceanica was the most used species, found in eight published papers, followed by the red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii with four studies. Two articles were available on the use of pelagic Sargassum spp. (S. fluitans and S.natans) for construction materials (adobe and pavement), with potential good results. The literature presented results from the use of marine algae and sea grasses for particleboards, polymeric and cemented composites, adobe, pavement, facades, and roofs.

We discuss the present state and future estimates that some modelling have shown, reflecting on the effects that this may have on those coastal, mostly rural areas mainly depending on them as source of protein and income. Secondly, we look in detail to particularly relevant areas of coastal economies, the deltas, as one of the most likely affected areas of global change. Based on several sources, mainly gridded or downscaled Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI) measures, we analyze different paths that some of the large deltas in Asia may encounter under different scenarios, often described globally, making use of existing downscaled data.

One aspect that is seldom discussed is the trade facilitation and liberalization that is achieved through its efficient implementation. In this chapter, we attempt to capture just that-the impact of global trade and its subsequent economic consequences in the blue economy. This would help in understanding whether the objectives of enhanced economic growth and employment opportunities can be obtained through trade liberalization. The paper studies this aspect using simulations of computational general equilibrium analysis. The results suggest that imports and overall welfare may increase due to the trade liberalization between IORA and non-IORA countries in the blue economy sectors. The economies act positively by increased access to global markets in order to utilize the abundantly available blue economy resources. Import expansion can be as high as half a percent of initial imports in some countries. Trade impact is much more visible in certain industrial sectors, than others. Therefore, it can be unequivocally stated that for the growth of the blue economy, trade liberalization measures may be undertaken for the promotion of economic growth and welfare of the region. With improved trade facilitation, countries will have an improved logistic performance score. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Others,positive",10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8_4,Blue growth;Carbon emissions;Computational general equilibrium;Contingent valuation;Economic growth;Global trade;IORA;Social inclusion;Trade facilitation;Trade liberalization,,,10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8_4,DOI(,10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8_4,DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-96519-8_4) OR,,,,,

Meanwhile, sustainable renewable energy sources are critical to economically realize seawater desalination. Marine renewable energy has tremendous potential to power blue economy and is co-located with seawater. This paper proposes a compact autonomous ocean-wave-powered reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system by directly pressurizing seawater using a wave energy converter (WEC). The proposed ocean-wave-powered reverse osmosis desalination system consists of an oscillating surge wave energy converter (OSWEC) hinged on the nearshore seabed with a self-rectified piston pump and a RO desalination module on the shore. Seawater is pressurized by the WEC and pumped to the RO desalination module as feed where it then produces permeate that is free of undesired molecules and larger particles. Numerical modeling of the integrated system is created, and simulation is done under realistic irregular wave conditions. Preliminary experiment was implemented in a wave tank.

These places blessed with spectacular seascapes and beaches have significant and diverse natural, cultural, indigenous and heritage impacts that are easily and regularly accessed by residents and visitors. The growing recreational fishing could be developed as part of catamaran tourism in near shore and offshore of those areas. Again, Bangladesh can develop standard and advanced cruise shipping destinations in those areas enriched with coastal and marine tourism which is the main focus of this chapter. The emerging catamaran tourism in these areas may include a range of activities such as sea kayaking, whale watching, SCUBA diving, coastal sightseeing, beach walking, surfing, and touring as well as attractions, parks, accommodation, festivals and special events that have a marine theme or tourism experience. Significant problems lie in fundamental statistical gaps detailing the magnitude of coastal and marine tourism.

Recently, considerable success of artificial intelligence in many applications, especially deep learning (DL) technique, motivates us to apply the same for prediction of sea surface temperature. We have built an attention-based ensemble model over a set of basic models based on different DL techniques that consume uniquely prepared variant datasets to produce better predictions.

Meanwhile, sustainable renewable energy sources are critical to economically achieve seawater desalination. Marine renewable energy has tremendous potential to power the blue economy and is co-located with seawater. This study proposes an ocean wave powered reverse osmosis desalination system, which consists of an oscillating surge wave energy converter with a piston pump and a reverse osmosis desalination module with an accumulator on the shore. Seawater can be pressurized by the oscillating surge wave energy converter and pumped to the reverse osmosis desalination module as feed where it then produces permeate that is free of undesired molecules and larger particles. Numerical models considering potential flow theory of the wave energy converter and solution-diffusion theory of the reverse osmosis membrane were established. A 1:10 scaled prototype was designed, fabricated and tested in a wave tank based on the Froude scaling law. Comprehensive wave tank tests were implemented, characterized, and analyzed considering the water-energy nexus.

Like many common environmental assets, oceans have been impacted by a history of imperfect governance resulting in substantial negative consequences for these important socio-ecological systems. Aligning and managing multiple trade-offs between policy targets for the management of human activities in the marine domain has been increasingly attempted using Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). More recently, Ocean Accounting (OA) has appeared as a framework that extends national, environmental, and ecosystem accounting, and provides a structure to integrate the information describing ocean ecosystems and their changing relationships with society and the economy. Globally, MSP is therefore employed to prioritise actions towards strategic objectives, while OA is being developed to centralise, standardise, and integrate ocean information. As awareness of human dependence on healthy ocean ecosystems has increased, the use of both MSP and OA has grown rapidly across the world, and intersections between the two frameworks, both geographically and theoretically are emerging. To inform both MSP and OA communities of practice, this paper explores their role in strategic ocean governance, and how synergies may be enhanced to further an understanding of complex ocean systems. Thoughtfully aligned, the two frameworks might work together with OA providing dynamic inputs to an adaptive MSP process. The early recognition of synergies between the two frameworks, and their potential for co-development, is considered imperative to advance effective ocean governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104936,Blue economy;Ecosystem-based management;SEEA;Socio-economic activities;decision making;governance approach;marine environment;socioeconomic status;spatiotemporal analysis;strategic approach;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104936,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104936,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104936) OR,,,,,

However, using this microorganism on a large scale is expensive, especially in the cultivation stage. Thus, nanoparticles have been evaluated as a promising alternative to assist in the cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, offering solutions for different stages of the processes. Furthermore, nanomaterials contribute to the economic viability and processing efficiency of microalgae-based products that can be essential in mitigating or preventing adverse environmental impacts.

There is ever increasing demand on the coastal zone by tourists, residents and developers alike; it is named as the fastest growing sector of the blue economy. Hence, coastal zone processes require better understanding to be effectively managed in the context of sustainable development of the asset. While sea level may be rising over the long-term, and many global-resolution studies lament the loss of sandy beaches as a result, coastal managers work over far shorter time-scales thus require site specific information to manage the coastal zone on a daily and monthly basis. In this contribution we discuss nine years of morphological change along a sandy beach in Durban, South Africa. The beach is managed by the eThekwini Municipality who are responsible for maintaining a coastal zone of ca. 100 km. The morphological data of this study were collected on a near monthly basis over 9.6 km of sandy beach between October 2011 and March 2020. From these data, beach volume and area are calculated and the variation is documented over time in conjunction with wave data recorded from a proximal directional wave buoy. Over the study period, the beach has experienced a net loss of 177885m3 and 29,375 m2 in volume and area respectively. However, the beach response has not been uniform throughout the study area. The southern three-quarters of the beach were affected by significant losses while the northern one-quarter gained in volume and area over the same period. The summer wave climate is characterised by increased variability in swell origin with greater easterly contributions than other seasons, and typically lacks the frequency of large swell (>3.5 m) events (7% of events) common to autumn (20%), winter (35%) and spring (38%). Winter, followed by spring then autumn seasons have more focused swell origins and southerly contribution, particularly in terms of large swell events. During periods of reduced event frequency allow for partial beach recovery, while erosion is associated with periods of increase event frequency. The sediment budget has been significantly reduced though impoundments on the proximal river catchment, compounded by un-managed sand mining. Rather than sea level, these near-field controls on sediment availability likely play a major role in beach volume and area in response to wave climate.

It is defined as a holistic framework for an environmentally friendly and socio-economically sustainable development of ocean-related activities with a special emphasis on technological innovation. Capture fisheries are widely considered to have no substantial growth potential and consequently are not subject to the European Union’s Blue Growth strategy. In our review, we, however, argue that capture fisheries should play an essential role in national Blue Growth strategies. We identified two interconnected management strategies to foster Blue Growth in fisheries, a) the implementation of Community Development Quota (CDQ) systems and b) the support of small-scale fisheries (SSF). They hold the potential to benefit fishery-dependent coastal communities and therefore counteract consolidations in the fishing sector. Additionally, they provide the possibility to improve quota access for small-scale fishermen. Besides having better access to quota, the future of SSF depends on sources of public funding for technical improvement and innovation as well as increased representation in the management. In this perspective, we present different cases that successfully implemented CDQs (the Alaska pollock fishery) or have considerable potential to implement CDQ programs or improve their current approaches (United Kingdom, Ireland, and Iceland). We further discuss examples for successful management strategies to support SSF directly. If these aspects are considered in a Blue Growth strategy, the survival of fishery-dependent communities could be assured, and SSF could develop from predominantly part-time or subsistence fisheries to a full-time occupation. By those means, they would be part of a fostering Blue Economy and strengthen environmentally friendly and socio-economically sustainable fishing practices in Europe.

At the same time, industrial production of value added fishery products generates significant amounts of nutrient-rich discards, besides voluminous amount of process effluents. These discards, by-catch and effluents are rich sources of nutrients, industrially important ingredients and also bio-energy. Developments in marine biotechnology offer novel eco- friendly green processes for bio-refining of discarded seafood portions. This article discusses potentials of green processing for the valorization of seafood discards and process effluents towards zero waste that can improve sustainable seafood supply chain. The green processes generally make use of bioconversions of discards to release components attached to food matrices, which are extracted by suitable downstream processing techniques. Algal biotechnology and biorefinery-based approaches have significant scope for commercial scale processing of seafood discards. Because of their functional nature, the isolated products can have valuable applications in health, therapeutic and industries in other fields. Green processing can encourage zero-waste seafood processing, environmental protection, blue economy and has potential to realize the Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) of the United nations, particularly the SDG #12.3. © 2022 The Author","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Biotechnology",10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100164,Bio-refining;Blue economy;Circular bioeconomy;Green processing;Seafood sustainability;Seafood waste biomass,,,10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100164,DOI(,10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100164,DOI(10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100164) OR,,,,,

Tropical marine applications are particularly scarce, especially in SE Asia. Given the growing coastal population and expansion in blue economy sectors in SE Asia, evidence to support effective marine planning, such as ecosystem service assessments, is urgently needed. Data deficiencies for marine systems, especially (but not only) in lower income countries is a significant obstacle for ecosystem service assessments. To overcome this, we develop an ecosystem service potential matrix which combines evidence taken from an extensive literature review together with expert opinion. The matrix includes both natural and modified habitats as the service providing units. The ecosystem service potential for habitats are scored at the macro level (e.g. mangrove) due to insufficient evidence to score micro-habitats (e.g. fringe, basin or riverine mangroves). The majority of evidence is available for biogenic habitats (mangroves, coral reefs and seagrass meadows) with comparatively little for sedimentary habitats. While provisioning, regulating and cultural services are scored, published evidence is more readily available for provisioning and regulating services. Confidence scores, indicating the uncertainty in the ecosystem service potential scores are included in the matrix. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to systematically capture the provision of ecosystem services from tropical marine habitats. Although initially developed for four marine biosphere reserves and protected areas in SE Asia, the generic nature of the evidence included suggests that the matrix constitutes a valuable baseline for marine ecosystem service assessments within SE Asia and provides a robust foundation for development in future work. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101346,Confidence scores;Ecosystem service potential;Evidence gaps;Habitats;Modified;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101346,DOI(,,,,,,,

Important actions that have been identified in support of sustainable development goals include capacity-building, training, and education. This includes educational opportunities for ocean-based renewable energy development in support of a healthy planet and ocean. Offshore wind is experiencing rapid development globally and, while the U.S. offshore wind market is still nascent, it is on the brink of exponential growth based on large cost reductions driven largely by European development and technology advances. Growth is also expected in wave and tidal energy with significant opportunities identified for various distributed markets through the Powering the Blue Economy™ initiative, with longer-term implications for expansion at the utility scale (LiVecchi et al 2019 Powering the blue economy; exploring opportunities for marine renewable energy in maritime markets p 207). In order to expedite progress and maximize benefits to the national, state, and local economies, these development actions will require a broad, diverse, and appropriately trained workforce. The ocean-based renewable energy workforce needs engineers and scientists to develop cost-effective technologies, as well as trade and maritime workers to eventually deploy the technologies at scale. In the United States, educational institutions, state governments, and private developers are taking action to understand job skills and capability requirements and to develop educational and training programs to meet offshore workforce needs; most are focused on offshore wind power, with gaining interest in marine energy. This article explores the workforce requirements of the growing ocean-based renewable energy industry and the current state of education and training programs to meet those requirements in order to identify gaps and make recommendations for further workforce development activities and initiatives. An international view needs to be adopted that incorporates the education and skill needs of early-stage marine energy technologies and evolving offshore wind technologies together with more market-ready offshore renewable energy markets.

Growing global demand for seafood has attracted diverse actors to African waters, including Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs) fleets. Complex fisheries governance challenges, unsustainable rates of fishing and rising fisheries-related crimes have ensued. To reverse these impacts, some African states are deploying various fisheries governance mechanisms. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, the review of literature, fisheries databases, international and regional agency reports, NGO and government reports and case studies from West and East Africa, we demonstrate two critical findings. First, fisheries governance mechanisms in Africa act largely to constrain small-scale fisheries (SSF) while failing to contain the industrial fisheries sector, resulting in the marginalisation of the SSF. Secondly, despite a higher incidence of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in industrial fisheries than the SSF, fisheries governance mechanisms continue to advance the 'Survival of the Richest' – the industrial sector, to the detriment of the 'Fittest' – the SSF. The SSF supports millions of jobs and is better adapted to meet the continents' nutrition and socio-economic security. For the fisheries sector to contribute to the sustainable development of Africans, states must redirect governance towards regulating the industrial sector, emphasising equitable access for the SSF whilst prioritising ecological sustainability. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,fisheries",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104847,DWFNs;Fisheries governance;Ocean grabbing;Securitisation;SSF;East Africa;West Africa;fishery management;governance approach;seafood;sustainable development;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104847,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104847,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104847) OR,,,,,

As such voluntary commitments provide an important mechanism through which to monitor the evolution of the concept and identify gaps or shortfalls in its implementation. Our analysis of global voluntary commitments on the Blue Economy made to recent high-profile ocean futures meetings, found a trend towards capacity development, research, and investment in emerging and larger scale sectors such as offshore aquaculture and renewable energy. A concurrent focus was on securitizing, regulating or diverting effort from historically significant fisheries sectors.

The advantage introduced by this marine biomaterial is the characteristic siliceous structures coupled with high-content of metals and halogenated compounds which mediated the C–SiO heterogeneous reactions under a distinctive in-situ generated gas mixture.

Blue growth supports the sustainable growth of the maritime and marine sectors as the oceans and seas are engines of the global economy and have great potential for growth and innovation. This article undertakes a bibliometric analysis in the terms of Blue Economy (BE), Maritime Economy (MAE), Ocean Economy (OE), Marine Economy (ME), and Blue Growth (BG) to analyze the scientific production of this field of study. Analysis of the authors’ definitions of BE, BG, ME and OE provides interesting relationships divided into sustainability and governance; economics and ecosystem protection; industrial development and localization; and the growth of the ocean economy, with development as the central axis that encompasses them. The main contribution is to find out if there is a link between the BE and the CE through the keyword study. Results: The results show a significant increase in articles and citations over the last decade. The articles address the importance of different sectors of BE and the interest of governments in promoting it for the development of their national economies. Using bibliometric mapping tools (VOSviewer), it is possible to find possible links between concepts such as CE and BE through the BG and to visualize trending topics for future research. Nascent and future research trends include terms such as small-scale fisheries, aquatic species, biofuel, growth of the coastal BE, internationalization and blue degrowth (BD), the latter approaches aspects of BG from a critical perspective. Conclusions: In conclusion, it highlights the need for alliances between the sectors that compose BG with the incorporation of the CE in order to achieve a sustainable BE in both developed and developing countries. Through the keyword analysis it is shown that the BG strategy is the bridge between the BE and the CE. The CE presents itself as a promising alternative that could mitigate tensions between stakeholders who support both growth and degrowth positions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1186/s12302-021-00502-1,Bibliometric analysis;Blue Economy;Blue growth;Marine economy;Maritime economy;Ocean economy;economic activity;economic development;global economy;globalization;industrial development;mapping method;research work;sustainability;sustainable development,,,10.1186/s12302-021-00502-1,DOI(,10.1186/s12302-021-00502-1,DOI(10.1186/s12302-021-00502-1) OR,,,,,

Various contested interpretations exist, and different actors choose to emphasise different aspects of the triple goal of environmental, economic, and social improvements. However, despite disagreement over its interpretations, the blue economy finds support in many different arenas. This paper explores the position of dominance that the blue economy has reached, and examines how supporters of the concept maintain and employ power to keep it relevant. The paper applies a mixed-methods approach: 29 semi-structured interviews with people in roles of formal decision-making across the fisheries sector, economic development and tourism sector, conservation and environment sector, and specific blue economy-institutions are supplemented by observations from the wider landscape during 4 months of fieldwork in Seychelles. Findings show that in international discourse, the blue economy obtains and maintains its influence through persuasion and through the construction of a ‘common sense’ and productive way forward, capable of achieving triple wins. Within this narrative, oceans are undergoing a reconfiguration as economic frontiers, and the blue economy places economic growth from oceans centrally within contemporary environmental governance. Maintaining the blue economy as a powerful concept on the ground is done through social power relations: the blue economy functions as a boundary object, contributing to depoliticisation of discussions about a shared vision. Depoliticisation allows Seychelles to continue using the concept despite simmering dissent among policy makers, practitioners, and resource users. Dominance of the blue economy on the international stage means that associating with it brings Seychelles visibility and influence. The usefulness of the concept in eliding tensions makes it difficult for counter-hegemony to arise, although alternatives are emerging elsewhere, such as blue justice. However, fundamental change is needed to re-politicise environmental decision-making and explicitly discuss values and images attached to the blue economy. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104673,Blue growth;Ocean economy;Ocean governance;Small island developing states;Sustainable development;Seychelles;economic development;economic growth;economic policy;governance approach;hegemony;marine policy;small island state;sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104673,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104673,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104673) OR,,,,,

To be successful in these efforts, they have been pushing technological development which in turn has increased the demand for power as most of these developments are power hungry. However, with the present power generation knowledge confined to fossil-fuel, achieving sustainability has been limited and a challenge to achieve. To overcome this limitation and to harness the full potential of the ocean-based Blue Economy, countries around the world, including India, are making concerted efforts to develop sustainable technologies to generate usable power from ocean-energy. Accordingly, the options available for utilising ocean-based renewable energy technologies to sustainably power growth through economic activities in the marine and coastal domain while being a meaningful contributor to the blue economic growth is discussed. In doing so, a global perspective of the status of the Blue Economy of marine renewable energy technologies with a focus on the opportunities for India has been provided.

While many of these islands are dependent on a small-scale fishing industry for survival, their fishing communities face challenges in navigating complex fisheries governance systems at local, regional, national and EU scales. Between 2018 and 2020, I engaged with Irish island fishing communities, the fishing industry and the policy environment in interrogating the political and institutional challenges faced by island fishing communities and their initiatives to manage island fisheries on a collective, seasonal basis. This collection of found poems emerged accidentally while I was analysing and writing up the research. As such, they are an unintended contribution to experimental geographies and join the recent resurgence in creative and arts-based work by geographers and social scientists. Created from the interview transcripts of research participants, the poems provide a snapshot of the complexity of the issues at play during the research period. They highlight the multiple storylines that jostle for space and visibility in the fisheries governance context. The mosaic of voices demonstrate that contestation and contradictions exist and play out not just between islanders and non-islanders, but between islanders themselves, often with no resolution. By allowing for a multiplicity of meanings to co-exist, my hope is that this collection of found poems will disturb the fixed narratives amongst those who are engaged in Irish fisheries, challenge the boundaries within which scholarly research is traditionally presented, and render the research accessible to a wide range of audiences © Published with Creative Commons licence: Attribution–Noncommercial–No Derivatives","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries",,Ecopoetry;Environmental governance;Found poems;Islands;Political ecology;Small-scale fisheries,,,Fishing For Survival in the ‘Blue Economy’– Found Poems From the Irish Islands,TITLE(,Fishing For Survival in the ‘Blue Economy’– Found Poems From the Irish Islands,TITLE(Fishing For Survival in the ‘Blue Economy’– Found Poems From the Irish Islands) OR,,,,,

The recent interest in the Blue Economy has led the scientific community to increase investigations in sustainable oceanic energy options, such as Point Wave Energy Converters (WEC). These devices harvest the wave energy using the excited oscillatory motion of the buoy, which is connected to a Power Take-Off system (PTO). During the last decades, the development of these devices has been boosted but they are still behind other renewable energy technologies. The Furthlab at Texas A&M University has showed that the spheroid buoy shape with a low length to diameter ratio is a good candidate shape to extract wave energy, by testing different buoy shapes and aspect ratios at a non-linear Stokes-II wave generation. This paper is the next step in our research and numerically investigates the effect of changing the wave characteristics, such as amplitude, frequency, and speed, on the power-generating ability of the spheroid buoy system. Three-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of the selected buoy were performed in OpenFOAM with the integration of a dynamic mesh module to handle the heave motion of the buoy. In addition, the PTO system was compensated with a forced oscillator mechanism of spring and damper. A comparison between the buoy’s displacement and frequency responses, and power efficiency showed the optimal operating sea state to maximize energy output using the spheroid WEC. The results conclude that the best wave conditions to maximize the power extraction efficiency using a spheroid buoy with a diameter of 1 m and length of 0.5 m are wave length greater than 4 m, wave height less than 0.15 m, and wave speed between 0.07 and 0.12 m/s.

International efforts to address these challenges include the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the UN 2030 Agenda. Further, some countries are refocusing their ocean programs to align with blue economy strategies globally. We look to Canada, an ocean nation developing a blue economy strategy, to examine the climate-responsiveness of their oceans policies. First, we identify climate change impacts on ecosystem services affecting each of Canada's coasts through a document scan. Then, through a structured policy analysis, we examine whether Canadian fisheries and oceans policy are responsive to these impacts. Finally, we discuss how current policies do or do not address climate impacts on oceans and coasts in Canada, and how this focus, or lack thereof, will have an outsized impact on certain ocean sectors (e.g., inshore fisheries). Our findings show a policy landscape largely dependent on climate change action promoted in a few broad federal initiatives, with oceans-related climate action operating through area-based conservation measures and research and monitoring initiatives. We conclude with recommendations for Canada and similar ocean states to integrate climate and ocean policies across federal departments and ocean sectors by centering vulnerable coastal users in policy formulation. Given Canada's rapid development of a blue economy strategy as a new governing framework for oceans policy, we recommend the strategy be guided by long-term sustainability goals that prioritize environmental and social sustainability over short-term economic growth. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,fisheries,Tier 1 (BE)",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104623,Blue economy;Climate change;Ecosystem services;Policy integration;Canada;climate change;economic growth;ecosystem service;environmental economics;environmental management;fishery policy;marine policy;policy analysis;policy approach;policy implementation;strategic approach;sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104623,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104623,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104623) OR,,,,,

From cavalier exploitation of offshore resources spurred on by dreams of infinite wealth, nations now recognize a thriving ocean economy needs a healthy ocean. Past events brought global attention to the impressive rise in offshore revenue generated by the Blue Economy. In 2021, ocean values were estimated at $2.5 trillion annually (Sumaila et al., 2021). The advent of ex-clusive economic zones enhanced by technological innovations led to rapid in-creases in off shore commercial and industrial activities, accompanied unfortunately by mismanaged and overexploited resources. The resultant decline in ocean health from unsustainable practices, compounded by climate-related im-pacts, provided the momentum toward sustainable strategies for development, institutionalized by the 2016 United Nations (UN) Conference on Sustainable Development and the resultant Sustainable Development Goals. National practices expanded categories of original estimates of ocean gross domestic product, formerly based solely on National Income Accounts to include environmental and non-market assets, revealing a more accurate net estimate of the ocean’s values. The New Blue Economy, or knowledge-based economy, has been in large part responsible for economists’ ability to capture environmental and non-market values, allowing this paradigm shift toward a sustainable world to occur. The NBE generates the rapid pace of scientific discovery and technological innovations that facilitated those discoveries through advanced measurement and analytical tools.

Though there is a vast diversity of macroalgal species along the coastal states of India, they are not fully explored for their nutraceutical benefits. In this study, the antioxidant and antiglycemic properties along with its polysaccharide and total phenolic content of fifteen selected macroalgae from the Indian coast was evaluated. The antioxidant activity was assessed based on the radical scavenging and reducing power efficiency and the antiglycemic activity was determined based on its α-glucosidase inhibition capacity. The results show that Pterocladia capillacea (Rhodophyta) and Stoechospermum marginatum and Sphacelaria rigidula (Phaeophyta) exhibited good antioxidant and antiglycemic activity, equivalent to model compounds. Statistical analysis shows a highly significant correlation between both these activities and the total phenolic content. Characterizing the bioactivity can benefit the current generation as they are greatly affected by various chronic diseases due to oxidative stress.

The following indicators were analyzed in samples: cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) (in water and fish tissues), respectively, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) (in fish tissues). The pollution index (PI) was calculated to identify the most polluted studied ecosystem, which revealed that Danube River is seriously affected by the presence of Fe (IP = 4887) and strongly affected by the presence of Zn (IP = 4.49). The concentration of Cd in fish muscle tissue was above the maximum permitted level (0.05 µg/g) by the EU regula-tion. From all analyzed OS biomarkers, MDA registered the highest median values in fish muscle (145.7 nmol/mg protein in DR, 201.03 nmol/mg protein in DD, 148.58 nmol/mg protein in BS) and fish liver (200.28 nmol/mg protein in DR, 163.67 nmol/mg protein, 158.51 nmol/mg protein), com-pared to CAT, SOD and GPx. The prediction of Cd, Pb, Zn, Fe and Cu in fish hepatic and muscle tissue was determined based on CAT, SOD, GPx and MDA, by using non-linear tree-based RF prediction models. The analysis emphasizes that MDA in hepatic tissue is the most important inde-pendent variable for predicting heavy metals in fish muscle and tissues at BS coast, followed by GPx in both hepatic and muscle tissues. The RF analytical framework revealed that CAT in muscle tissue, respectively, MDA and GPx in hepatic tissues are most common predictors for determining the heavy metals concentration in both muscle and hepatic tissues in DD area. For DR, the MDA in muscle, followed by MDA in hepatic tissue are the main predictors in RF analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

By developing what was called Integrated Maritime Policy, there was an attempt to coordinate different sectorial policies and thus adding value, through synergies and economies of scale. At the same time, and as a result of scientific and technological advances, five strategic sectors with great growth potential were identified: aquaculture, renewable energies, blue biotechnology, deep sea mining, and nautical tourism. These were the pillars for the Blue Growth Strategy, leading to more jobs and global economic growth. This trend quickly spread to other continents, universalising the concept of blue growth. However, the growing competition for maritime space, due to new uses, led to the realisation that along with the need to ensure confidence and stability for investors, it would be imperative to develop new planning and management instruments for these spaces. During this process, governments quickly realised that this evolution, which had the potential for far reaching economic and social impacts, required a new institutional framework adapted to this new reality, which would end up having an impact on the governments structure itself. We have witnessed, particularly during the last decade, a profound conceptual change in the governance of maritime space. The design of new political, legal, institutional, and governmental frameworks, which are introducing a new model of maritime and marine governance at a global scale, are probably the most critical one since World War II. This article develops this analysis, based on several examples, both in the EU as well as in other countries outside the bloc, particularly those surrounding the Atlantic, in order to demonstrate that the drive towards a blue economy triggered a profound and deep change in marine policies and governance. © Copyright © 2021 Guerreiro.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2021.681546,blue growth;marine policy;maritime governance;maritime spatial planning;ocean economy,,,10.3389/fmars.2021.681546,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2021.681546,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.681546) OR,,,,,

This study therefore employs such a methodology to determine the economic importance of tourism and visitor spending in the sanctuary to Monroe County, Florida’s economy. Visitors who came to the area for ocean recreation and tourism spent a total of USD 1.7 billion, which translates to a contribution of 19,688 total jobs, USD 752 million in total labor income, USD 1.2 billion in total value added, and USD 2 billion in total output to the region. With regard to the spending of snorkelers and divers only, total spending is about USD 1.07 billion, contributing about 12,441 total jobs, USD 466 million in total labor income, USD 767 million in total value added, and USD 1.2 billion in total output.

Islands of the same archipelago have faced various challenges in terms of tourism growth and related impact. Primarily, tourism has been characterised by seasonality (the strong spatio-temporal concentration of tourists in a destination) especially in the most peripheral islands. In other cases, tourism has grown considerably resulting in overemphasis on mass tourism throughout part of the year. This is largely experienced due to Sand, Sun and Sea (3S) tourism. Fieldwork, including interviews with key stakeholders and ecotours off-season, was conducted in the Aegadian Archipelago, off the west coast of Sicily. Findings revealed that ecotourism not only is the preferred alternative form of tourism among stakeholders but is also possible and ideal as confirmed through the ecotours. This is because different ecotourism activities can be practised all year round, thus mitigating seasonality. In return, this can help ease the financial, social and environmental challenges associated with current tourism models improving the well-being of local communities. Marine ecotourism is considered as a means to give more value to marine protected areas and to make existing tourism activity in the peak season more sustainable. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,tourism,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s40152-021-00238-x,Aegadian Islands;Archipelago;Blue economy;Central Mediterranean;Ecotourism;Seasonality;Italy;Sicily;Trapani;archipelago;economic growth;ecotourism;marine park;seasonality;spatiotemporal analysis;tourism economics;Seasons,,,10.1007/s40152-021-00238-x,DOI(,10.1007/s40152-021-00238-x,DOI(10.1007/s40152-021-00238-x) OR,,,,,

However, preferences are ‘reason-blind’, obscuring the underlying values that shape them. Increasingly, values – concepts or beliefs about desirable end states or behaviours that transcend specific situations and guide behaviour – receive attention in environmental governance, but lack of clarity in values terminology could hamper communication and reduce the ability to successfully align governance. There is a need to disentangle preferences and values to examine whether ecosystem services preferences provide adequate information on people's values. Seychelles provides an interesting case to study the relationship between policy, preferences, and values, due to recent neoliberal economic restructuring and emergence of the blue economy. We conducted 50 semi-structured interviews with resource users (fishers, tourism operators) and 130 population-wide Portrait Values Questionnaires to explore differences across the population and examine the link between values and preferences. We find a disconnect between ecosystem services preferences and underlying values. Exploring people's reasons for prioritising ecosystem services can improve understanding of underlying values, contribute to reconciling conflict, and clarify impacts on communities. Newly introduced worldviews and values accompanying the blue economy have the potential to clash with collectivist values found in Seychelles.

In certain coastal social-ecological systems, this has resulted in significant changes and sustainability challenges. In particular, coastal environments which used to support only capture fisheries are becoming sites for brackish water aquaculture production; this impacts the sustainability of aquatic food production. Sustainability challenges associated with aquaculture expansion and intensification necessitate a contextually rooted understanding of institutions and institutional changes which can be used as an informed basis for leveraging institutions to achieve desirable sustainability outcomes in the aquatic food sector. This research used a qualitative empirical case study involving in-depth interviews, participant observation, and analysis of institutional documents in the region of Central Luzon, Philippines. It applied the inter-institutional systems concept which considers multiple institutions with distinct but linked purposes and functions in the societal spheres of state, market, and civil society. The study found that aquaculture emerged as an important livelihood because of rice farmers’ need to adapt to saltwater intrusion into what were formerly rice farms. It grew into an industry due to developments in the availability and accessibility of inputs such as fingerlings and feeds. This process was also driven by the high demand and high profitability of fish farming at the time. Regulatory institutions have not adequately adapted to protect the environment. Market institutions adapted but the changes mostly benefited consignacions (middlemen) and large-scale players. However, organised groups of collaborating smallholder fishers and fish farmers are helping to address the disadvantages they face. © 2021, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,fisheries,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s10113-021-01853-4,Blue economy;Blue food;Mariculture;Social change;Sustainability;Transformation;Philippines,,,10.1007/s10113-021-01853-4,DOI(,10.1007/s10113-021-01853-4,DOI(10.1007/s10113-021-01853-4) OR,,,,,

Research has drawn attention to its contested nature and the propensity of sectoral interests to co-opt it to their own ends. An emerging body of critical studies of the Blue Economy, as practiced, provides an opportunity to address the question “What is the blue economy?” in new ways. This review of published empirical case studies initiates a conversation between governmentality concepts and place-space–time theory, aiming to open new lines of enquiry regarding the influence of spatiality on the nature of governance. This approach has allowed the elucidation of a complex and nuanced understanding of the Blue Economy, complementing earlier discourse and content analyses. In relation to Blue Economy governance, I pose the specific question, “Does place matter?”, leading to an interrogation of material and spatial relations in Blue Economy governance.

In order to build a stable and long-term international cooperation mechanism in marine plastic waste, this paper takes the country as the research object and propose an international marine plastic waste cooperation network. We introduce the “Matthew effect” of network connection and relationship cost into the model from the perspective of social relations, and uses the method of the evolutionary game on complex networks to construct the evolutionary game model of marine plastic waste treatment. Through simulation methods, this paper explores the impact of economic factors, relational structure and game structure on the evolution of management cooperation of marine plastic waste. It not only provides a theoretical basis for international cooperation in marine plastic waste management, but also provides a clear direction for its implications in practice. Based on the theoretical analysis and empirical research, this research finds that: First, in management cooperation of marine plastic waste, economic factors are the most direct factor, relational structure plays a regulatory role, and game structure is an intermediary variable. Second, the benefits and costs of governance cooperation in economic factors promote and inhibit the cooperation behavior of group respectively. Relationship structure has a two-way effect on the cooperation behavior of group and network stability. Moreover, the cumulative income weight in the game structure is positively related to the partner density. Finally, the key to the current cooperative governance of marine plastic waste is to build a stable and long-term market mechanism, properly handle the influence of major powers, regulate the governance relationships, and promote international cooperation in marine plastic waste management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Maybe } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104774,Complex network evolutionary game;Governance cooperation;Marine plastic waste;Prisoner's dilemma;governance approach;marine pollution;network analysis;plastic waste;prisoner dilemma;research;sustainable development;waste management;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104774,DOI(,,,,,,,

Ocean climate change (‘CC’) modelling may become a key decision-support tool for MSP, but traditional modelling analysis and communication challenges prevent their broad uptake. We employed MSP-specific ocean climate modelling analyses to inform a real-life MSP process; addressing how nature conservation and fisheries could be adapted to CC. We found that the currently planned distribution of these activities may become unsustainable during the policy's implementation due to CC, leading to a shortfall in its sustainability and blue growth targets. Significant, climate-driven ecosystem-level shifts in ocean components underpinning designated sites and fishing activity were estimated, reflecting different magnitudes of shifts in benthic versus pelagic, and inshore versus offshore habitats. Supporting adaptation, we then identified: CC refugia (areas where the ecosystem remains within the boundaries of its present state); CC hotspots (where climate drives the ecosystem towards a new state, inconsistent with each sectors’ present use distribution); and for the first time, identified bright spots (areas where oceanographic processes drive range expansion opportunities that may support sustainable growth in the medium term). We thus create the means to: identify where sector-relevant ecosystem change is attributable to CC; incorporate resilient delivery of conservation and sustainable ecosystem management aims into MSP; and to harness opportunities for blue growth where they exist. Capturing CC bright spots alongside refugia within protected areas may present important opportunities to meet sustainability targets while helping support the fishing sector in a changing climate. By capitalizing on the natural distribution of climate resilience within ocean ecosystems, such climate-adaptive spatial management strategies could be seen as nature-based solutions to limit the impact of CC on ocean ecosystems and dependent blue economy sectors, paving the way for climate-smart MSP. © 2021 The Authors.

A typical assumption of existing techno-economic models of tidal energy converter (TEC) arrays is that TECs positioned to minimise negative hydrodynamic interactions will maximise economic return. That the number of TECs within an array should be chosen to maximise the annual energy production, follows from this assumption. To examine the validity of these assertions for small, area-constrained arrays, a hypothetical model of the relationship of levelised cost of energy (LCOE) to the mean mechanical annual energy production (MMAEP) is developed. The model exhibits three classes of behaviour, determined by the rate of energy lost to interactions as TECs are added to an optimally positioned array; significantly, only one class has greatest MMAEP corresponding to lowest LCOE. To test this model, a contemporary optimisation algorithm is added to the advanced ocean energy techno-economic simulation tool ‘DTOcean’ and applied to arrays of TECs constrained by a 2ha deployment area. It is shown that the hypothetical LCOE model accurately describes the DTOcean results up to and including 12 TECs deployed. At 13 TECs deployed, the level of TEC interaction increases dramatically, invalidating the hypothetical model. Notably, however, the LCOE is shown to reduce significantly by allowing negative interactions between TECs, reducing by 47.8% from the best non-interacting array. Thus, subject to an improved understanding of the relationship between the environment, TEC reliability and costs, the results indicate that allowing negative interactions between TECs may increase the economically extractable resource of small area-constrained tidal energy sites. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117091,Arrays;DTOcean;Levelized cost of energy;Optimisation;Techno-economic modelling;Tidal energy converter;Constrained optimization;Economics;Hydrodynamics;Tidal power;Annual energy productions;Array;Dtocean;Hydrodynamic interaction;Levelised cost of energies;Optimisations;Techno-economic modeling;Tidal energy;Tidal energy converters;array;competitiveness;cost analysis;economic conditions;energy resource;hydrodynamics;simulation;tidal power;Costs,,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117091,DOI(,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117091,DOI(10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117091) OR,,,,,

The rapid global advancement of offshore wind coupled with its potential to affect marine life compels an urgent need for robust methodologies to assess the impacts of this industry on fisheries resource species. Basic Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) and Control-Impact (CI) designs are the most common experimental designs used to study the effects of offshore wind development on fisheries resources. These designs do not account for spatial heterogeneity which presents a challenge because empirical evidence shows that impact gradients occur at wind farms, with larger effect sizes close to turbine foundations that attenuate with increasing distance. Combining the before-after sampling design with distance-based methods could provide a powerful approach for characterizing both the spatial and temporal variance associated with wind development. Toward enhancing future monitoring designs for fisheries resource species at offshore wind farms, this paper aims to: (1) examine distance-based sampling methods that have been or could potentially be used to study impacts on fisheries resources at offshore wind farms including distance-stratified BACI, distance-stratified CI, Before-After-Gradient (BAG), and After-Gradient (AG) methods; (2) synthesize the methods and findings of studies conducted to date that have used distance-based methods to examine ecological impacts of offshore wind development for benthic macroinvertebrates, finfish, birds, and small mammals; (3) examine some of the central methodological elements and issues to consider in developing distance-based impact studies; and (4) offer recommendations for how to incorporate distance-based sampling methods into monitoring plans at offshore wind farms. © Copyright © 2021 Methratta.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3389/fmars.2021.674594,BACI;BAG;gradient;marine renewable energy;methodology;sampling design;Health Resources,,,10.3389/fmars.2021.674594,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2021.674594,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.674594) OR,,,,,

It brings uncertainty to the long-term prospects of blue development in the region. Secondly, it is shown that the EU and national polices seem not to have an impact on the specialization patterns in the BSR.

The Baltic Sea is considered as a pilot region, where a pan-Baltic coordinated MSP plan has been developed to provide for sustainable development and blue growth in the marine and coastal economy. The Russian Federation is one of the Baltic countries, but the MSP procedure at the state level does not have institutional and regulatory support, which requires the elimination of gaps and additional development of the maritime management system. The laws of the organization and development of the general theory of management are used in this study. An Integrated Management Model for sustainable marine and coastal use is proposed as a tool for ensuring blue growth, including four interrelated elements (specific management functions), namely “Integrated Coastal Zone Management”, “Marine Spatial Planning”, “Management of Marine Macroregion” and “Ocean Governance”. Their functional content and interaction mechanisms are discussed in order to implement an integral approach to marine use. The vertical structure of the proposed integral model includes three levels corresponding to the federal and regional levels of government and the level of municipal self-governance.

GO2DAT will combine data from the coastal and open ocean, as measured by the chemical Winkler titration method or by sensors (e.g., optodes, electrodes) from Eulerian and Lagrangian platforms (e.g., ships, moorings, profiling floats, gliders, ships of opportunities, marine mammals, cabled observatories). GO2DAT will further adopt a community-agreed, fully documented metadata format and a consistent quality control (QC) procedure and quality flagging (QF) system. GO2DAT will serve to support the development of advanced data analysis and biogeochemical models for improving our mapping, understanding and forecasting capabilities for ocean O2 changes and deoxygenation trends. It will offer the opportunity to develop quality-controlled data synthesis products with unprecedented spatial (vertical and horizontal) and temporal (sub-seasonal to multi-decadal) resolution. These products will support model assessment, improvement and evaluation as well as the development of climate and ocean health indicators. They will further support the decision-making processes associated with the emerging blue economy, the conservation of marine resources and their associated ecosystem services and the development of management tools required by a diverse community of users (e.g., environmental agencies, aquaculture, and fishing sectors). A better knowledge base of the spatial and temporal variations of marine O2 will improve our understanding of the ocean O2 budget, and allow better quantification of the Earth’s carbon and heat budgets. With the ever-increasing need to protect and sustainably manage ocean services, GO2DAT will allow scientists to fully harness the increasing volumes of O2 data already delivered by the expanding global ocean observing system and enable smooth incorporation of much higher quantities of data from autonomous platforms in the open ocean and coastal areas into comprehensive data products in the years to come. This paper aims at engaging the community (e.g., scientists, data managers, policy makers, service users) toward the development of GO2DAT within the framework of the UN Global Ocean Oxygen Decade (GOOD) program recently endorsed by IOC-UNESCO. A roadmap toward GO2DAT is proposed highlighting the efforts needed (e.g., in terms of human resources).

This study innovatively implements the ideas of sustainability and economy from the blue economy, and the affection (or Kansei in Japanese) from the Kansei engineering into a product design process to become a novel affective-blue design methodology of a product form. The proposed methodology mainly contains three aspects. The first aspect is the merge of a novel Kansei blue model with the traditional Kansei engineering to deal with the semantic space and form decomposition issues encountered in the product form designing process. The second aspect is the adoption of proper data mining schemes to optimally trim and obtain the kernel information from the Kansei evaluation data of products. The third aspect is the usage of appropriate machine learning schemes to establish a precise relationship between product images and design elements from the kernel information. A case study was conducted for the form design of a computer-numerical-control lathe to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology. The verification results, that all predictive errors are within 4.5% for test samples, show that our blue-affective design methodology is quite satisfying.

It is necessary to promote the establishment of a scientific and systematic Marine plastic waste and microplastic pollution control system and take strong measures to fundamentally curb and reverse the trend of marine pollution intensification in China. This paper first explains the practical significance of marine plastic waste and microplastic pollution control from three aspects: the sustainable development of the blue economy, the structural upgrading of the pan-plastic industry, and the improvement of public health awareness. Secondly, the particularity of marine plastic waste and microplastic pollution control system is summarized from three aspects of formation mechanism, migration path and damage performance. Then, it identifies domestic and international governance strategies and action plans from the perspectives of mechanism, subject, object, and measures, summarizes existing problems in the existing marine plastic waste and microplastic pollution control system, and gives directions for future improvement. Finally, some countermeasures and suggestions are put forward to accelerate the construction of China's marine plastic waste and microplastic pollution control system, including the formation of a cross sectoral integrated land and sea control system, a full life cycle waste management process, a multi-participation model for marine ecological and environmental governance, and a global marine pollution prevention and control system. © The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,positive,Biotechnology",10.1016/j.cjpre.2022.01.008,Global governance;Governance system;Land and marine development in a coordinated way;Marine plastic waste;Microplastic pollution;China;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.cjpre.2022.01.008,DOI(,,,,,,,

Due to the global financial crisis, yacht ownership has declined, but demand for such holiday products remained steady, therefore shifting the yachters profile towards younger and less experienced consumers who prefer to charter boats, rather than own one. Boat chartering offers more flexibility to explore different regions from year to year, but this means that significantly more time must be spent planning the route, since local experience is absent. The tourists’ experience during the initial contemplation and planning phase, taking place weeks or months before an actual trip, and where a broad range of route options needs to be explored, could thus significantly benefit from support given by automated IT tools. Current literature demonstrates a complete lack of research in the development of itinerary recommendation systems in the context of sailing holidays. In this paper, we describe a methodology for the automatic generation of route recommendations, based on the semantic modelling of spatial data, and the determination of realistic sea route options, based on vessel density maps produced from raw AIS data.

However, these ecosystems are vulnerable to anthropogenic influences such as climate change, pollution and habitat destruction. The European Union (EU) recognises the role of the blue economy in providing jobs and contributing to economic growth, with the EU Integrated Maritime Policy being a cross-sectoral framework within which maritime activities are managed and coordinated. Sustainability is a central tenet, ensuring that sectors such as aquaculture and offshore wind energy, which are earmarked for growth, must develop in ways that do not negatively impact the health of the marine environment. However, there is currently little consideration of how these activities might impact public health. The current research used survey data from 14 European countries to explore public perceptions of these issues, broadly focusing on 10 maritime activities, with a specific focus on five activities related to the EU's 2012 Blue Growth Strategy. The respondents appreciated the interconnections between these maritime activities, environmental protection and public health, as well as the potential trade-offs. Preferences for policy intervention to protect public health from different activities were predicted by both marine contact (marine sector employment, recreational activities) and socio-demographic (political attitudes, gender, age) variables, potentially aiding future engagement and communication initiatives.

Our results illustrate the islands with high potential for improvement in terms of adapting capacity and, by indicating the contribution of the different risk components, highlight the main environmental and socio-economic elements that affect the islands’ vulnerability and risk under climate change.

In this brief commentary, we identify three key challenges to the establishment of a national aquaculture act in Canada and we examine the likely impact of these challenges to the future shape and direction of aquaculture regulation, with implications that extend beyond Canada. We critically reflect on the potential implications of a weak act, one that will not overcome the ongoing socio-ecological conflicts associated with aquaculture in Canada and elsewhere. The most likely outcome will be for these conflicts and demands to be resolved in the courts, which will provide a new critical area for social science research on marine policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104700,"Aquaculture act;Blue Economy;Canada;aquaculture production;conflict management;critical analysis;demand analysis;legislation;regulatory framework;Social Control, Formal;Social Control, Informal",,,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104700,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104700,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104700) OR,,,,,

The public availability of systematic and long-term information of the ocean is an engine for the Blue Economy, boosting economic growth, employment, and innovation. An overview of some Brazilian initiatives is presented in this paper, involving universities, private companies, federal and state agencies, covering institutions from south to north of Brazil. Although these initiatives focus mainly on ocean physics, integrated efforts can extend the scope to include biogeochemistry and marine biodiversity, helping to address interdisciplinary problems. Existing initiatives can be connected, and new ones fostered, to fill in the gaps of temporal and spatial coverage of ocean monitoring in the vast oceanic area under Brazilian jurisdiction (nationally referred to as the Blue Amazon, in reference to the similar richness of the Amazon Forest). The alignment among national and regional initiatives, as well as with international programs, can be promoted if coordinated by a national-level organization, maximizing the return of public investment and socioeconomic benefits. In light of international examples, possible future institutional arrangements are discussed, leveraging from existing national public policies and international cooperation that Brazil is taking part. The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development is a timely opportunity to encourage an institutional arrangement to support and articulate an integrated network of coastal observatories in Brazil. © Copyright © 2021 Franz, Garcia, Pereira, de Freitas Assad, Rollnic, Garbossa, da Cunha, Lentini, Nobre, Turra, Trotte-Duhá, Cirano, Estefen, Lima, Paiva, Noernberg, Tanajura, Moutinho, Campuzano, Pereira, Lima, Mendonça, Nocko, Machado, Alvarenga, Martins, Böck, Toste, Landau, Miranda, dos Santos, Pellegrini, Juliano, Neves and Polejack.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Maybe } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3389/fmars.2021.681619,Blue Amazon;blue economy;coastal observatories;ocean observations;operational oceanography;United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development;Brazil,,,10.3389/fmars.2021.681619,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2021.681619,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.681619) OR,,,,,

The research method is qualitative-descriptive used by analyzing the news from five reputable online news media in Indonesia using NVivo 12 plus software and other literature related to research problems. The results showed that the intensity of reporting on the green economy discourse varies between each online news media, namely: labor absorption indicators are more dominant reported by Tribunnews.com and Kompas.com, natural resource management by Tempo.co, waste reduction by Detik.com, and poverty alleviation by Antaranews.com. Meanwhile, in the blue economy concept, the most dominant indicators reported are indicators of efficiency in using natural resources by Tempo.co and Kompas.com, poverty alleviation by Detik.com and Antaranews.com, and waste-free indicators by Tribunnews.com. Furthermore, word frequency analysis on the green economy concept shows that the most frequently reported topics are about the use of renewable energy, while in the blue economy concept, the most frequently discussed topics are about fish farming for sustainable food and the cleanliness of the oceans from waste. Compared to the blue economy concept, the green economy concept has been reported more by the media. However, the blue economy concept is a bit more favored because it is cheaper and more environmentally friendly/waste-free.

Currently, all European regions are monitoring and evaluating their performances alongside with the Smart Specialisation policy to make adjustments for the upcoming funding period. The Blue Growth concept entitles a large contribution to reach the emphasised goals and thus, ports can be an important actor and key driver for a sustainable and green future development. Hence, this paper analyses the current significance of smaller ports in Baltic Sea NUTS-2 regions reflected in the individual RIS3 maritime and/or logistic priorities as well as Blue Growth sub-sectors from the funding period 2014–2020 to contribute to the future design of RIS3.

The article attempts to analyse whether Chilean legislation complies with the FAO framework, particularly in the area of tenure rights over fishing inlets as well as whether this framework is accepted by those engaged in small-scale fishing. The hypothesis is that, in areas not covered by statutory law, which is mandatory, fishermen have already been intrinsically applying the FAO framework, which is voluntary. Thus, it is important to acknowledge their practices when developing legislation and legal reforms that attempt to introduce such a framework.

Considering the seafood industry discards half of its fish-product mass in the ocean, a proper valorization of its residues would decrease not only the ocean contamination but also improve the management of marine resources and increase the sector competitiveness. With these goals in mind, ocean-based industries are adopting new sustainable production models, similar to biorefineries, which are effective for waste valorization, namely, converting low-value biomass into commercially relevant by-products. Based on a deeper knowledge of aquatic feedstocks, the development and implementation of a marine biorefinery can be fundamental to consolidate a ""greener""socioeconomic development, similar to that observed in green chemistry. However, biorefineries are sophisticated multi-step systems with numerous feedstocks and commodities. Therefore, their implementation requires expertise in all stages of manufacturing, in addition to a clear vision of all raw materials, residues, and products. In this sense, with this perspective, we provide an initial overview of the current state-of-the-art on marine biorefineries and the sources and applications of their by-products.

Environmental change, however, is becoming a key driver for dive tourists’ decisions to travel, and these tourists are avoiding areas where coral reefs are no longer pristine. Indirect environmental risks, occurring outside the borders of countries and outside the control of dive operators, impact coral reef tourism within those countries and on the greater Blue Economy. Indirect environmental risks include climate change, industrialisation of coastal regions, increased shipping and boating activities, as well as marine and land-based pollution. This paper reports on the perceptions of dive operators on the indirect environmental risks which threaten the future of the dive tourism industry in the East African Marine Ecoregion. The research followed an exploratory and descriptive research design within a post-positivism paradigm. Via purposive sampling, surveys were conducted with 34 dive operators from Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa. Research findings indicate two overall areas of concern impacting coral reefs—activities relating to climate change, followed by coastal development and industrialisation of coastal areas. In terms of specific indirect risks, marine pollution is significant, followed by coral bleaching and extreme weather events. There is an increasing level of concern that continued environmental disturbances will impact business in future. This is not just a problem for the coastal tourism industry but also for coastal communities who share this precious resource. It is vital to cast a spotlight on the turbulent waters of environmental risks, which ultimately affect the sustainability of marine tourism and the wider Blue Economy. By doing so, regional plans can be shaped to respond to these threats in a more discerning way. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: tourism,negative",10.1007/978-3-030-92491-1_9,Dive operators;East African Marine Ecoregion;Environmental change;Indirect environmental risks;Marine tourism;Scuba diving industry;Military Personnel,,,10.1007/978-3-030-92491-1_9,DOI(,10.1007/978-3-030-92491-1_9,DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-92491-1_9) OR,,,,,

Mechanical harvesting has been implemented ending in landfills. Since Sargassum algae represent abundant biomass in tropical regions of the world, it has shown potential as a feedstock to supply bioprocesses focused on obtaining high-value compounds and bioproducts. Nevertheless, there is a lack of data on the biochemical composition of Sargassum biomass from Mexican Caribbean coasts to propose valorization pathways. This study conducted a biochemical and elemental characterization of Sargassum biomass and compared, through statistical analysis, the effect of the season (dry and wet), place of collection (from the beach and shallow water), and method of extraction (Microwave-Assisted Extraction and Enzyme Assisted Extraction) on biomass composition. The biomass composition, expressed in dry weight basis, revealed 5–7% moisture content, 24–31 % ash, 2.6–3.8 % lipids, 1.8–7.0 %, total carbohydrates, 3–11 % total proteins, 1.5–2.31 mgGAg−1 total phenolic compounds (TPC), 2.7–2.9 kcal g−1 calorific power, and metals such as As (30–146.3 ppm), Fe (16.5–45 ppm), P (197–472 ppm). The most influential factor on the compositional content of Sargassum biomass was the season of the year, followed by the extraction method and the place of collection of Sargassum. These results will elucidate information on the biotechnological potential of Sargassum biomass from the Mexican Caribbean, contributing to sustainability challenges of the region, minimizing waste, and making the most of resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Biotechnology",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113507,Biomass valorization;Blue economy;Characterization;Chemical composition;Environmental impact;High-value compounds;Sargassum biomass;Biomass;Caribbean Region;Ecosystem;Sargassum;Seasons;Caribbean Coast [Mexico];Mexico [North America];arsenic;benzoic acid;carbohydrate;iron;lipid;metal;phenol derivative;polyphenol;protein;belowground biomass;biochemical composition;biochemistry;biomass;biomass allocation;phenolic compound;seagrass;seasonal variation;Article;ash;carbohydrate analysis;Caribbean;Caribbean Sea;dry weight;economic aspect;elemental analysis;energy yield;environmental impact;environmental protection;environmental temperature;enzyme assisted extraction;infrared spectroscopy;Mexico;microwave assisted extraction;moisture;nonhuman;particle size;seashore;seaweed;Trametes sanguinea;ecosystem;season,,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113507,DOI(,,,,,,,

A number of distinct, and sometimes conflicting discourses have emerged in relation to the Blue Economy, which are distinguished by the degree to which they prioritize different development objectives. This paper explores the range of Blue Economy interpretations, governance strategies and implementation approaches that exist across Commonwealth countries. Key Blue Economy policy statements and governance instruments are analysed in order to ascertain the way the Blue Economy is being institutionalized at a national level, with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals and the Commonwealth Blue Charter. High-level Blue Economy objectives appear to prioritize economic and environmental objectives, with limited engagement with equity objectives including food security and gender equality. Blue Economy objectives are primarily being institutionalized through a diverse array of strategies, plans and policies with limited information on mechanisms for implementation. Finally, there are signs that the Blue Economy may be facilitating a greater degree of integration across sectoral management, with the emergence of range of boundary-crossing arrangements in a number of the countries examined.

However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geo-graphic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta–Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost‐efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water‐dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Brăila, Galați, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the ʺDanube Delta” Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already‐existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galați county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galați compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost‐demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Changes were assessed on (1) access to fishing, derived from lockdowns and other mobility restrictions; (2) ecosystems, because of alterations in fishing intensity and human presence; (3) the blue economy, derived from alterations in the investments and expenses of the fishers; and (4) society, in relation to variations in fishers’ health and well-being. For this, a consultation with experts from 16 countries was carried out, as well as an international online survey aimed at recreational fishers, that included specific questions designed to capture fishers’ heterogeneity in relation to behavior, skills and know-how, and vital involvement. Fishers’ participation in the online survey (5,998 recreational fishers in 15 countries) was promoted through a marketing campaign. The sensitivity of the fishers’ clustering procedure, based on the captured heterogeneity, was evaluated by SIMPER analysis and by generalized linear models. Results from the expert consultation highlighted a worldwide reduction in marine recreational fishing activity. Lower human-driven pressures are expected to generate some benefits for marine ecosystems. However, experts also identified high negative impacts on the blue economy, as well as on fisher health and well-being because of the loss of recreational fishing opportunities. Most (98%) of the fishers who participated in the online survey were identified as advanced, showing a much higher degree of commitment to recreational fishing than basic fishers (2%). Advanced fishers were, in general, more pessimistic about the impacts of COVID-19, reporting higher reductions in physical activity and fish consumption, as well as poorer quality of night rest, foul mood, and raised more concerns about their health status. Controlled and safe access to marine recreational fisheries during pandemics would provide benefits to the health and well-being of people and reduce negative socioeconomic impacts, especially for vulnerable social groups.

This paper attempts to map the construction and mobilization of the blue economy concept in the Pacific Islands over the last ten years through case studies of three regional bodies: the Pacific Small Island Developing States grouping (PSIDS), the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF), and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Rather than working to uncover some central definition or understanding of a Pacific blue economy, this paper frames the concept as a political tool that is mobilized by specific agents in response to specific challenges and in pursuit of specific goals. It is suggested that the blue economy has been engaged as an instrument of political maneuver by Pacific regional bodies, with these agents leveraging the concept across both regional and international platforms to advance their political and diplomatic interests. However, emerging observations also indicate a potential disconnect between the political effectiveness of this concept and its material reality, namely its ability to advance sustainable ocean development outcomes on the ground to the benefit of Pacific communities and ecosystems. Therefore, while the blue economy may present an attractive political tool for Pacific Islands agents, this paper suggests that greater scrutiny is required into the concept's material value and virtue. © 2021","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104880,Blue economy;Blue pacific;Ocean development;Pacific island countries;Small island developing states;Sustainable development;Pacific islands;developing world;diplomatic relations;environmental economics;environmental management;international relations;marine policy;resource management;small island state;sustainability;sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104880,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104880,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104880) OR,,,,,

However, these waste materials still contain molecules essential for the human diet, such as essential metals, vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, and proteins of high nutritional value. The re-use of such wastes for the production of dietary supplements for human consumption would perfectly fit with the concept of Blue Economy, defined as the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of the ocean ecosystem. Moreover, waste product revenue will be a key factor in maintaining long-term profitability of industrial food processing. In this work, the yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) was used as a model for fish processing by-products, as it is a large epipelagic species widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical waters of the major oceans. The determination of heavy metals and histamine is an essential control point for the re-utilization of the wastes. Then, they must be monitored in all the processes leading to the formulation of new high-quality products. Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry and a fast gas chromatographic–mass spectrometry methods were validated and applied for the determination of metals and histamine and amino acids, respectively. In particular, both essential and heavy metals and histamine and amino acids were quantified in tuna fish by-products. The presence of essential metals and essential amino acids in the analyzed samples represents the strength point of the proposed model, which aims to valorize by-products and reduce the disposal of wastes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,fisheries,aquaculture",10.1007/s12161-021-02045-w,Blue economy;Free amino acids;Heavy metals;Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry;Tuna fish;Amino acids;Dietary supplements;Economics;Fatty acids;Fish;Fish products;Fisheries;Food processing;Gas chromatography;Inductively coupled plasma;Mass spectrometry;Molecules;Nutrition;Tropics;Vitamins;Waste utilization;Added value products;Essential amino acids;Essential and heavy metals;Human consumption;Nutritional value;Omega-3-fatty acids;Subtropical water;Toxic contaminants;Waste disposal,,,10.1007/s12161-021-02045-w,DOI(,,,,,,,

Recently developed wave energy conversion technologies have the potential to help overcome these limitations by providing co-located and persistent power generation for ocean observations, enabling new opportunities for ocean research. In this paper, we develop the first techno-economic model for wave-powered ocean observation systems and use the model to study system characteristics and cost drivers. Our model utilizes time-domain simulation and optimization to identify cost-optimal system characteristics and to estimate capital and operational costs. Using our model, we evaluate the use of wave energy to power a 200 W ocean observation system deployed for five years at five unique geographic locations. We found that, depending on the geographic location, cost-optimal wave energy powered systems require an ≈ 0.5–3 kW wave energy converter and an ≈ 15-50 kWh battery. The corresponding range of power system costs over the deployment duration is between $110,800 and $673,200. We build on these results by performing a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters and identifying the potential economic impact of future technology advancements.

The concept seeks to explore ocean-based development opportunities with environmental stewardship and protection. Yet different scholars and actors adopt this term often in conflicting ways without attempting to explore the relevance and the link between the blue economy and the broader environment viz., total environment. The potential opportunities to resolve the conflicts require a better understanding of the impacts and/or interactions of the BE on the total environment. This paper aims to map the interface between the two for a better understanding of the total environment and implications for the BE. Using a systematic literature review, this study finds that the field of the blue economy in association with the total environment is very new and emerging in the literature, and the link between the BE and the total environment is increasingly being invoked, yet clarity on the link or interactions remain vague. By analysing the co-occurrence of selected keywords and networks, we present six clusters (three for general relationship, and the other three for specific dimensions of total environment). In a general relationship between the BE and the total environment, clusters of environmental sustainability, marine resource, and economic development are identified to link directly to the BE. In specific dimensions of the total environment, clusters of growth and sustainable development, spatial planning and environmental management, and environmental sustainability and the BE are presented. The analysis outcomes show that specific areas from the total environment (growth, spatial planning, environmental management, and environmental sustainability) are directly linked to the BE where a call for a wider range of studies in the future is identified. © 2021 The Author(s)","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.envint.2021.106796,Blue economy;Coastal management;Interdisciplinarity;Marine policy;Ocean economy;Total environment;Economic Development;Sustainable Development;Economics;Environmental management;Marine biology;Planning;Blue economies;Environment mapping;Environmental researches;Environmental sustainability;Spatial planning;coastal zone management;conceptual framework;environmental management;environmental protection;future prospect;mapping method;marine policy;article;environmental sustainability;human;sea;sustainable development;systematic review;economic development;Sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106796,DOI(,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106796,DOI(10.1016/j.envint.2021.106796) OR,,,,,

Many have not developed integrated blue economy strategies and road maps, and this delays the progress and vision for an African blue economy envisaged by Agenda 2063 and 2050 Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy. For Africa, however, the blue economy offers greater opportunity beyond the economy and the environment. It presents Africa with a unique opportunity to achieve its national objectives, to improve regional integration, and to exert influence in the global setting.

However, relatively little is known about how communities perceive tourism development as an alternative and potentially sustainable livelihood in their area and its implications. This qualitative study tracks a governance system in transition and analyzes the factors perceived by stakeholders to be driving and hindering the adoption of tourism-based livelihoods on small islands in UNESCO’s Taka Bonerate Kepulauan Selayar Biosphere Reserve (Indonesia). The findings indicate that, despite a series of tourism-enhancing investments and initiatives and the positive attitudes of local communities towards it, tourism is not a direct route towards sustainability for small island communities. The benefits of tourism are perceived to be unequally distributed. The lack of education and skills limits participation in new job opportunities, and the incentives to continue destructive fishing inhibits livelihood transition to tourism. The article concludes that tourism cannot be assumed to generate simultaneous benefits for conservation and development without more equitable benefit sharing, the meeting of basic needs in communities, and addressing the drivers of unsustainable livelihoods. © 2021 by the authors.

The Fishery sector has the potential of about USD 5 billion for the Blue Economy in Kenya. Crab fishery in Kenya is active in some areas of the south and north coast. The crab resources along the Kenyan waters are diverse and a variety of species are edible. The most commonly fished crab by artisanal fishers is the Mangrove Mud Crab Scylla serrata. Semi-commercial and industrial fishers usually have portunid and other deep sea crabs as by-catch in trawl and longline fisheries, which in many cases are unutilized. Exports of live crabs have increased over the years, with exports mainly to Asian countries. Export of frozen crabs started recently. The need to sustainably utilize lake, river and ocean resources is recognized and important in promoting Blue Economy.

Complete removal of subsea structures is often the default approach although some regions retain structures under rigs-to-reefs programs. Here, we reviewed the published literature to understand the status of global research on decommissioning, and specifically identify gaps in ecological knowledge. We estimated the frequency of different research categories (i.e., themes, and spatial/temporal scales), and tested the assumption that the number of papers across the categories of each research aspect was even in distribution. However, the frequency of studies focusing on biodiversity at a local (≤100 km2) scale (relative to regional and oceanic and pan-oceanic scales) were significantly higher; while other theme categories (e.g., eco-toxicology, connectivity, structural-integrity, restoration and other) were significantly lower than expected. Temporally, ≤1-year studies were more frequent than multi-year studies, but these frequencies did not significantly deviate from the assumed distribution of equal frequencies. We propose that further research be carried out to evaluate the benefits of both retention and removal of structures. Ecological research on decommissioning should extend its focus beyond biodiversity, to include eco-toxicology, structural-integrity, connectivity at larger spatial and temporal scales.

The Bio-Oscillator design utilises a hard “skeleton” (e.g., carbon fibre, wood) on which biological organisms (e.g., shellfish, large macroalgae) are grown. As waves pass by, the load generated by the oscillating drag and inertia is transferred through mooring lines to power takeoff technology. This novel approach essentially reverses the typical marine engineering view that “bio-fouling is bad” and instead leverages off the added-drag of biological growth on structures. The approach results in a structure that is largely biodegradable, naturally self-replicating and synergistic with the background environment, self-de-risking in terms of failure impact and can leverage off its own form to enhance energy capture beyond a conventional design. This reduces impact while connecting with conventional marine industries such as aquaculture. A CBA examines the economic pros and cons of this approach, focusing on installation and material costs, along with benefits from synergistic production. The analysis suggests that in addition to typical wave energy obstacles (e.g., cable length, capture width, and power take off) the benefits (biodegradability, harvestability, and carbon reduction) of replacing much of the mass of the structure with living biological material can be included. © Copyright © 2021 Hildebrand, Fischer, Relano, Gorman and Stevens.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Maybe } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,positive,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3389/fmars.2021.628148,aquaculture;blue economy;macroalgae;marine energy converter;renewable energy;wave-structure interaction;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Tocopherols,,,10.3389/fmars.2021.628148,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2021.628148,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2021.628148) OR,,,,,

Assessing the long-term environmental impacts in terms of eutrophication and noise is a priority for both the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and cumulative impacts will be important for the Maritime Spatial Planning under the Integrated Maritime Policy. With the constant expansion of aquaculture production, it is expected that farms might be established further offshore in more remote areas, as high-energy conditions offer an opportunity to generate more power locally using Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) devices. A proposed solution is the co-location of MRE devices and aquaculture systems using Multi-Purpose Platforms (MPPs) comprising offshore wind turbines (OWTs) that will provide energy for farm operations as well as potentially shelter the farm. Disentangling the impacts, conflicts and synergies of MPP elements on the surrounding marine ecosystem is challenging. Here we created a high-resolution spatiotemporal Ecospace model of the West of Scotland, in order to assess impacts of a simple MPP configuration on the surrounding ecosystem and how these impacts can cascade through the food web. The model evaluated the following specific ecosystem responses: (i) top-down control pathways due to distribution changes among top-predators (harbor porpoise, gadoids and seabirds) driven by attraction to the farming sites and/or repulsion/killing due to OWT operations; (ii) bottom-up control pathways due to salmon farm activity providing increasing benthic enrichment predicated by a fish farm particle dispersal model, and sediment nutrient fluxes to the water column by early diagenesis of organic matter (recycled production).

A bibliometric progress assessment of MSP was performed for the period 2003–2019 to analyse 1323 papers published in the ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases. The analysis revealed that MSP is a relatively new, however rapidly growing research field, as the number of MSP publications increased exponentially, at about 44% per year, between 2003 and 2019. The dominance of the journal “Marine Policy” on MSP publications and the presence of leading authors with government-related positions (i.e. 11%, n = 981) indicate the linkage of MSP to policy and governance. Almost 70% of the MSP publications are case-based indicating MSP's practical orientation. More than half of the authors leading MSP publications are affiliated in Europe, while the majority of reported MSP case studies are undertaken within the European Union. Most, 63%, of all MSP studies (n = 1323) approach the matter in a qualitative manner, whereas only 22% of the quantitative and/or modelling studies (n = 489) are describing MSP applications, suggesting that the development of MSP quantitative and/or modelling methodologies is still at its infancy. The dominance of ecologists among the leading authors of MSP publications outlines the ecosystem-based approach used to address MSP.

This paper suggests conduits for economic development using a traditional strength, coastal and marine tourism, in conjunction with the emerging fields of ocean renewable energy, offshore aquaculture, marine biotechnology, and bioprospecting. The interlinkages between each activity are discussed. Knowledge gaps in offshore aquaculture, ocean renewable energy, marine biotechnology, and marine environment monitoring are identified. In each sector case, strategic and tactical decision-making can be achieved through the exploitation of ocean numerical modeling and observations, and consequently should be invested in and developed alongside the requisite computational resources.

Yet, as companies and governments race to capitalize on marine resources, substantial risks can arise for people and the environment. The dominant discourse that frames blue growth as beneficial for the economy, developing nations, and coastal communities risks downplaying the uneven distribution of benefits and potential harms. Civil society organizations and academics alike have been sounding the alarm about the social justice implications of rapid and unchecked ocean development. Here, we review existing literature to highlight ten social injustices that might be produced by blue growth: 1) dispossession, displacement and ocean grabbing; 2) environmental justice concerns from pollution and waste; 3) environmental degradation and reduction of ecosystem services; 4) livelihood impacts for small-scale fishers; 5) lost access to marine resources needed for food security and well-being; 6) inequitable distribution of economic benefits; 7) social and cultural impacts; 8) marginalization of women; 9) human and Indigenous rights abuses; and, 10) exclusion from governance. Through this critical review, we aim to stimulate a rigorous dialogue on future pathways to achieve a more just and inclusive ocean economy. We contend that a commitment to ‘blue justice’ must be central to the blue growth agenda, which requires greater attention to addressing the 10 risks that we have highlighted, and propose practical actions to incorporate recognitional, procedural, and distributional justice into the future ocean economy.

Using the case of marine aquaculture in the United States, we argue that a shift in focus to community wellbeing is necessary to realize the potential benefits of marine aquaculture expansion.

Unfortunately, there has been limited, if any, focus on fish health aspects. Rise in intensification and commercialization predisposes fish stocks to disease due to rise in stress levels and consequent reduction in the fish immunity. Nutrient rich surroundings create a conducive environment for rapid proliferation of bacterial and saprophytic fungal growth leading to net clogging and consequently a low biological oxygen demand. Such conditions predispose the stocks to infections. This study was conducted to provide a baseline analysis of the health conditions/status of the cultured fish in this region. It encompassed studies from 2016 to 2018 on tilapia of the genus O. niloticus using both experimental (using standard procedures and protocols) and socio-economic studies (using structured questionnaires, see annexure 1). Results found the following occurrences; bacterial infections (10%), fungal infestations (12.5%), myxosporean parasites in the gills (5%), parasitic copepods (10%) and fin rot (2.5%) in the stocks. There were no significant differences between abiotic parameters in the cage locations and the wild (p > 0.05). Additionally, 90% of the respondents had no fish disease training or clue on the treatment action necessary whenever fish diseases struck. Findings from this study put to the fore the significance of fish diseases in a cage culture system in light of commercialization of the industry and the importance of biosecurity and maintenance of optimal environmental conditions within the scope of Blue Economy growth in this region.

To gain more insight into the character and extent of such a gap, as well as how to address it, this article examines how social sustainability has been addressed in peer reviewed scientific articles on MSP between 2005 and 2020. Using search terms such as participation, democracy, social inclusion, social cohesion, equity we systematically identify and review 310 scientific articles that address diverse social sustainability concerns within MSP and marine governance. The review showed that very few papers systematically conceptualised or developed a coherent framework for engaging with social sustainability. Instead, they mostly addressed particular social concerns including participation and engagement, equity and social justice, socio-cultural values and preferences. Marine management and planning efficiency, as well as related instrumental framings of the merits of participation were the key arguments for including these dimensions of social sustainability in MSP. In terms of how to better include social sustainability in MSP, most attention was given to social-cultural mapping and ways to improve social inclusion/participation while also redressing exclusion and maldistribution of outcomes in MSP practice. We conclude that there is a need to deepen and diversify MSP inquiry with respect to social sustainability. In particular, scholars would do well to delve deeper and more broadly in social science literature to find inspiration on ways to understand and elucidate social issues. Here, the enormous body of relevant work on justice, power, critical institutionalism, political ecology and terrestrial planning literatures has hardly been tapped. It is also evident from this review that there is a need for both the academic and practice-based communities to more comprehensively address how the multidimensions of social sustainability interact with each other, as well as with economic and environmental aspects of marine planning and governance. Based on these observations, we highlight a set of suggestions on how to develop MSP research and practice on social sustainability. Most importantly, we argue that more in-depth co-production, linking scholars, practitioners and society actors, is needed. © 2021 The Author(s)","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105618,Equity;Marine governance;Participation;Social sustainability;Sustainable development goals;Behavioral research;Ecology;Blue economies;Marine Spatial Planning;Scientific articles;Scientific literature;Social inclusion;Spatial planning;Sustainable development goal;equity;governance approach;mapping method;marine policy;participatory approach;social behavior;spatial planning;sustainability;Sustainable development;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105618,DOI(,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105618,DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105618) OR,,,,,

The dominant policy response for dealing with multiple uses is the allocation of coastal space through coastal zone planning (CZP). Recent studies have shown that the rush to develop the blue economy and regulate coastal activity can result in social injustices and the exclusion of less powerful and unrecognized groups (e.g., small-scale fishers, women, Indigenous peoples and youth). To achieve a primary goal of the 2030 sustainable development agenda to ""leave no one behind"", it is important to understand the implications of coastal planning and development for these groups. Here, we present a social survey protocol for examining perceptions of justice related to small-scale fisheries (SSF) in the context of the blue economy in coastal areas. Specifically, we designed the survey instrument and sampling protocol to assess whether decisions about the use of the coastal zone over the last five years have i) followed principles of good governance, ii) recognized fishers' knowledge, culture and rights and iii) been attentive to impacts of changed coastal zone use on fisheries. The survey will engage coastal planners (N = app. 120) and fishers (N = app. 4300) in all the coastal municipalities (N = 81) in Northern-Norway. The sampling protocol is designed to ensure representation of different sectors of society, including those defined by gender, age, ethnicity and occupation (e.g., small-scale fishers, large-scale fishers, coastal planners). © 2021 Engen et al.

Multi-use (MU) is expected to enhance the productivity of blue economy sectors, as well as deliver additional socio-economic benefits related to the environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development. The paper provides a definition of maritime multi-use and identifies the multi-uses with the highest potential in EU sea basins. In each sea basin, multi-use plays a different role as concerns sustainable development. For the Eastern Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, the MU focus should remain on the environmental pillar of sustainable development. In the North Sea, North Atlantic and Western Baltic Sea, addressing social sustainability seems a key precondition for success of MU in enhancement of sustainable spatial development at sea. Moreover, it has been suggested to introduce MU key global strategies such as SDGs or Macroregional strategies and action plans and to supplement maritime spatial planning with sectoral incentives and educational efforts as key vehicles supporting MU. The paper concludes by identifying aspects which, in order to inform maritime spatial planning and maritime governance regarding a more conscious application of the aforementioned concept, require further investigation. Key tasks are related to: More profound evaluation of performance of policies supporting MUs, researching the impact of MU on societal goals and on the MU costs and benefits, including external ones, and finally identifying the impact of MU on the development of various sectors and regions on land. © 2021 by the author.

The Indian Ocean Region (IOR), despite its increasing contribution to onshore wind energy generation and impending policies on offshore wind energy, is reluctant to invest in the latter. Hence, this paper highlights four important aspects that challenge IOR’s offshore wind energy development: Indian Ocean’s strategic location, environment impacts, blue economy and maritime terrorism. In the background of the geopolitical rivalry existing in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), with the increasing presence of China and the USA in the Indian Ocean, this paper aims to study if these geopolitical challenges are hindering offshore wind energy generation in IOR. The key findings of the paper include the necessity of addressing the geopolitical rivalry in IOR as an important hindrance in huge investments needed in OWE farms, so that a regional cooperative mechanism is arrived at especially from the point of view of policies towards OWE generation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,negative",10.1007/s11356-021-12779-z,Blue economy;Environmental risks;Geopolitics;Indian Ocean Region;Maritime terrorism;Offshore wind energy;Renewable energy;Risks offshore wind;Wind energy;China;Indian Ocean;United States;geopolitics;maritime transportation;offshore structure;power generation;renewable resource;tourism;wind power,,,10.1007/s11356-021-12779-z,DOI(,10.1007/s11356-021-12779-z,DOI(10.1007/s11356-021-12779-z) OR,,,,,

Currently, aquaculture contributes approximately 50% of world total fishery production, hence becoming an important intervention in promoting food and nutritional security, and employment creation. Western Kenya is suitable for aquaculture production due to favorable climate and good soil as well as high demand for fish. The present survey purposed to assess the Socio-demographic characteristics of fish farmers, fish feed and seed producers in 9 Counties within Western Kenya The information obtained included socio economic dynamics and challenges to fish farming. Fish farming mainly occur in rural areas in Western Kenya where the most dominant system is earthen ponds, measuring 300 m2. Aquaculture in the region is male dominated and majority of players practice individual enterprises. The majority of the hatcheries are authenticated and the lack of credit facility was mentioned as the most important challenge. However, for feed producers lack of adequate raw materials was the most important bottle neck. From this study, both environmental and social factors in the region must be synergized to achieve aquaculture sustainability. There is need for empowerment of farmers through capacity building and availability of credit facilities whereas hatcheries and feed producers must be empowered with adequate skills and infrastructure in order to adhere to good standards.

To better manage ocean sectors and their development, we need to understand how they interact and the respective outcomes of these interactions. To provide a first comprehensive picture of the situation, we review 3187 articles to map and analyze interactions between economically important ocean sectors and find 93 unique direct and 61 indirect interactions, often mediated via the ocean ecosystem. Analysis of interaction outcomes reveals that some sectors coexist synergistically (e.g. renewable energy, tourism), but many interactions are antagonistic, and negative effects on other sectors are often incurred via degradation of marine ecosystems. The analysis also shows that ocean ecosystems are fundamental for supporting many ocean sectors, yet 13 out of 14 ocean sectors have interactions resulting in unidirectional negative ecosystem impact. Fishing, drilling, and shipping are hubs in the network of ocean sector interactions, and are involved in many of the antagonistic interactions. Antagonistic interactions signal trade-offs between sectors. Qualitative analysis of the literature shows that these tradeoffs relate to the cumulative nature of many ecosystem impacts incurred by some sectors, and the differential power of ocean sectors to exert their rights or demands in the development of the ocean domain. There are also often time lags in how impacts manifest. The ocean governance landscape is not currently well-equipped to deal with the full range of trade-offs, and opportunities, likely to arise in the pursuit of a Blue Economy in a rapidly changing ocean context. Based on our analysis, we therefore propose a set principles that can begin to guide strategic decision-making, by identifying both tradeoffs and opportunities for sustainable and equitable development of ocean sectors. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, tensions exist within sustainable development approaches, arising from differing perspectives framed around natural capital or social equity. Here we show that there are stark differences in outlook on the capacity for establishing a blue economy, and on its potential outcomes, when social conditions and governance capacity—not just resource availability—are considered, and we highlight limits to establishing multiple overlapping industries. This is reflected by an analysis using a fuzzy logic model to integrate indicators from multiple disciplines and to evaluate their current capacity to contribute to establishing equitable, sustainable and viable ocean sectors consistent with a blue economy approach. We find that the key differences in the capacity of regions to achieve a blue economy are not due to available natural resources, but include factors such as national stability, corruption and infrastructure, which can be improved through targeted investments and cross-scale cooperation. Knowledge gaps can be addressed by integrating historical natural and social science information on the drivers and outcomes of resource use and management, thus identifying equitable pathways to establishing or transforming ocean sectors1,3,4.

Second, to figure out which local government and civil society institutions are involved in the policy planning process and whether this sphere of local politics is transparent and open to public discussions? Third, to find out which specific aspects of the sustainable development and coastal blue economy concepts are given priority in the municipal development strategies?

The analysis included the contributions of meteorological properties to the distribution of the particulates, especially fugitive dust. We observed that the PM concentrations exhibited significant differences in the differential, spatial, and temporal patterns. During the wet season, the air movement zones were turbulence, interception, and divergence, whereas only the interception zone was observed in the dry season. For the wet season, the average daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations (in ppm) varied from 7 to 62 and 11 to 85, respectively, while, the respective daily mean concentrations ranged from 11 to 63 and 17 to 86. Furthermore, the fine/coarse ratio (PM2.5/PM10) ranged 0.63–0.83 and 0.65–0.73 during the wet and dry seasons, respectively, with 90% of the ratio being ≈0.70. The statistical t-value for PM10, PM2.5, and AQI were 0.60, 0.61, and 0.45, respectively, while their corresponding P-values were 0.56, 0.55, and 0.66, indicating no significant seasonal variations. Overall, Akure’s air quality is majorly influenced by environmental conditions (based on anthropogenic activities) and merely by meteorological conditions.

Despite their importance, the region's coastal and marine resources have been neither fully appreciated nor fully utilized. They are only now being recognized as being key to Africa's potential prosperity. As the region grows, it has, in general, not taken adequate safeguards to protect these valuable resources. That is partly because some of the problems (pollution, for example) are regional and know no borders. All too often, short-term gains are made at the expense of the long term (overfishing, for example). This book provides, for the first time, a study of the constraints and opportunities the blue economy offers for sub-Saharan Africa.

Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is an effective approach to ensure marine conservation and prevent over-exploitation of marine resources by sustainably utilizing its economic potential. Literature review in the Indian context indicates that studies have been undertaken in the sphere of blue economy and acknowledging the importance of MSP in specific sectors such as fisheries and marine resource management. However, studies on possible approach and guiding methodology for real application of MSP in the context of Indian coasts seem to be meagre. The current paper attempts to present the relevance of MSP in coastal zone management planning in India, through a unique MSP framework developed for the state of Odisha and also discusses possible strengthening of the institutional structure. The paper concludes by highlighting some key opportunities and challenges for Marine Spatial Planning in India. One of the major contributions of this study would be its possible use by relevant stakeholders, in the application of MSP for marine area management in varying spatial jurisdictions. Research highlights: 1.Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) framework to be contextualized and used in Indian context, in order to tap the nation's latent blue economy potential while also ensuring protection of its marine environment.2.Comprehensive application of MSP will facilitate integrated and informed decision making by government agencies and establishments concerned with the management of marine areas.3.A replicable and ecosystem based - adaptable approach to mainstream MSP in the Integrated Coastal Zone Management process.4.Stakeholder consultations including participatory exercises for conflict identification makes the findings broad based and sensitive to ground realities for addressing dynamics of marine areas. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,fisheries",10.1007/s12040-021-01574-6,blue economy;integrated coastal management;marine ecosystems;Marine Spatial Planning;India;Odisha;Argyrosomus regius;coastal zone management;decision making;integrated approach;marine ecosystem;marine environment;spatial planning;stakeholder;Military Personnel,,,10.1007/s12040-021-01574-6,DOI(,,,,,,,

To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia's unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry.

In this paper, we aim to assess the impact of maritime transport, related investment, and air pollution on economic growth within 20 countries of the European Union, using eight panel data regression models from 2007 to 2018. Our results confirm that maritime transport, air pollutants (NOx and SO2 ) from maritime transport, and investment in maritime port infrastructure are indeed positively correlated with economic growth. In other words, an increase of 10% in these factors has generated an associated increase in economic growth rate of around 1.6%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 0.7% respectively. Alongside the intensity of economic maritime activities, pollution is positively correlated with economic growth, and thus it is recommended that policymakers and other involved stakeholders act to diminish environmental impacts in this sector using green investment in port infrastructure and ecological ships, in accordance with the current European trends and concerns. © 2021 by the authors.

MP-contaminated ecosystems show reduced floral and faunal biomass, productivity, nitrogen cycling, oxygen-generation and carbon sequestration, suggesting that MPs have already started affecting ecological biomes.

As multiple initiatives on ocean literacy have arisen, a comprehensive understanding of this topic is required to better engage the broader society. In the present study, we applied a combination of bibliometric analysis and science mapping to a dataset of scientific publications on ocean literacy between 2005 and 2019, obtained from Web of Science and Scopus databases. In order to represent the development of the field, analyze the level of collaborations and uncover its thematic areas, we first used bibliometric analyses to describe the field’s main features, including indicators of growth and research collaboration. We then used science mapping techniques to build collaboration networks among countries and institutions, and to identify research communities. Lastly, we performed co-word analysis to reveal the underlying thematic areas and their evolution. Our results reveal a slow-growing number of publications and a promising trend for collaboration among authors, countries and institutions. Education and science were identified as the two major thematic areas on ocean literacy showing that, over time, issues related to these themes have gained more attention among researchers. These findings confirm that ocean literacy is gaining more acknowledgment within the scientific community but still faces considerable limitations to its dissemination in sectors like the blue economy and in regions such as Latin America and Africa. Promoting cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary cooperation among research institutions, marine education networks and the industry is critical to support this purposeful movement and represents an urgent challenge. © Copyright © 2021 Paredes-Coral, Mokos, Vanreusel and Deprez.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2021.648492,bibliometrics;blue economy;Ocean Decade;ocean literacy;science mapping;Sustainable Development Goal 14,,,10.3389/fmars.2021.648492,DOI(,,,,,,,

Furthermore, even if all fisheries in every country were perfectly managed to achieve their Maximum Sustainable Yield, a common sustainability target, average incomes of fishers in up to 49 countries—70% of fishers worldwide—would still not meet minimum living wages.

Recently, blended finance has received increased attention as a way to create biodiversity markets and attract private capital. Building on qualitative research on efforts to create markets for private investments in marine conservation, this paper analyses how an ensemble of non-governmental organisations, development finance institutions and philanthropists seek to fill the financing gap for marine conservation in the “Blue Economy” by using blended finance as a guiding principle. I argue that by offsetting the uncertainties related to investing in a new conservation finance space, blended finance is applied as a way to fix investors’ fictional expectations and gradually transform uncertainty in risk. In doing so, this paper contributes to the literature on for-profit biodiversity conservation by highlighting how capital's risk interpretations are constitutive of the effort to create new markets. While blended finance is applied to create new markets from below, I discuss two other possible futures that might emerge as blended finance is applied in this new frontier. On the one hand, it risks becoming a development rent that is captured by the financial sector.

The article substantiates the growth in the importance of maritime economic activity for the Russian Federation and emphasizes the peculiarities of realizing its interests in the World Ocean, taking into account foreign policy, marketing and economic, technical and technological, financial and investment, infrastructural, and institutional opportunities and limitations. Attention is focused on the factors and features of the dynamics and spatial localization of such important industries for Russia as seaports and logistics, hydrocarbon production on sea shelves, production and processing of marine biological resources, shipbuilding, and coastal industry. It is shown that, on the one hand, Russia’s sphere of potential (declared) interests is the waters of the entire World Ocean and, on the other, the country’s maritime activity has a predominantly Circumeurasian (delimiting the mainland confined to its marginal seas) character, consistently shifting (under the influence of climatic, market, and geopolitical factors) into the Arctic, as well as the coastal zones and water areas of the Far East. The maritime interests of the leading Russian companies (Gazprom, Rosneft, Lukoil, NOVATEK, Rosatom and Rosatomflot, Sovkomflot, Norilsk Nickel, etc.) are emphasized, an inventory of limiting factors and the risks of further maritime orientation of the Russian economy has been compiled, and the most important areas of Russia’s presence in regions of the World Ocean in conditions of growing geopolitical turbulence and geoeconomic competition are identified. As specific results, we should single out the well-substantiated priority directions of Russia’s presence in the World Ocean, as well as the main priorities and directions for building up an effective Russian presence there. The identified limiting factors and limitations of maritime activity in modern Russia are of particular interest. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1134/S2079970521030035,blue economy;coastal regions;geoeconomics;geopolitics;maritime activity;maritime interests;Russia;Russian corporations;World Ocean;Russian Federation;coastal zone;economic activity;economic growth;economics;foreign policy;turbulence,,,10.1134/S2079970521030035,DOI(,10.1134/S2079970521030035,DOI(10.1134/S2079970521030035) OR,,,,,

This review paper summarizes the recent advances in the valorization of fish waste for the preparation of biopolymers for food packaging applications. The issues related to fishery industry waste and fish by-catch and the potential for re-using these by-products in a circular economy approach have been presented in detail. Then, all the biopolymer typologies derived from fish waste with potential applications in food packaging, such as muscle proteins, collagen, gelatin, chitin/chitosan, have been described. For each of them, the recent applications in food packaging, in the last five years, have been overviewed with an emphasis on smart packaging applications. Despite the huge industrial potential of fish industry by-products, most of the reviewed applications are still at lab-scale. Therefore, the technological challenges for a reliable exploitation and recovery of several potentially valuable molecules and the strategies to improve the barrier, mechanical and thermal performance of each kind of biopolymer have been analyzed. © 2021 by the authors.

To reap economic benefits from maritime space, the government of Bangladesh recently emphasized the development of a blue economy. Maritime economic activities, including shipping, trade, fishing, fishing industries, mineral extraction, exploitation of hydrocarbons, salt production, production of renewable energy, and marine and coastal tourism, are key elements of the maritime interests of policymakers. However, the safety of maritime activities also raises concerns that include shipping accidents, smuggling, and illegal fishing, which pose threats to maritime interests.

This is evident from the partisan economic perception gap: Government supporters have more positive economic perceptions than opposition supporters, especially when the economic situation is ambiguous. Recent research has shown that the size of this partisan gap varies across different contexts and that the state of the economy and working of political institutions are important moderators. Still, little is known about the influence of another important contextual variable: the degree of partisanship in the media system. Based on a theoretical discussion of partisan-motivated rationalization and the information environment, the paper tests the hypothesis that, due to selective exposure and exposure to more partisan content, people in partisan media systems have more polarized economic perceptions. A multilevel analysis of representative surveys in twenty-six European countries in 2014 shows that the partisan perception gap is, indeed, larger in countries with more polarized media systems, after controlling for other relevant country characteristics. People with the highest level of media consumption are most affected by media-party parallelism. The findings are relevant for worldwide discussions about posttruth politics, as they show that the media environment influences gaps in people’s perceptions of real-world developments. © The Author(s) 2020.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,non-targeted",10.1177/1940161220926931,comparative research;economic news;economic perceptions;media;media systems;partisan motivated reasoning,,,10.1177/1940161220926931,DOI(,,,,,,,

In this paper, we have compiled information on the historical discrepancies in fisheries management in the extensive Brazilian waters and used it to illustrate the institutional neglect of this important blue-economy sector. Since the 1930s, when the first management agencies were registered, fisheries management has been handled by at least 10 different federal agencies. This discontinuity has resulted in a country that is ignorant, overall, of the quantity fished, where fishing occurs, and the status of its fish stocks. The only available long-term fishing production data is held by small state departments or marine protected areas and does not come close to reflecting the total catch of the country, with its continental dimensions and its mix of artisanal and industrial fisheries. For this reason, the present work has compiled information on the years of neglect in the governance of the fishing sector.

Public administrations are willing to contribute to counterpart marine litter but insufficient knowledge hindrance the progress. The integration of economic assessment in the decision-making may help to design knowledge-based solutions that guarantee a good marine litter management within the Blue Economy framework. Nonetheless, there is no clear methodology to do such assessments in the literature. In this study a new approach was implemented by assessing the effectiveness and the efficiency of four solutions designed to remove, monitor and/or manage floating marine litter (FML). In addition, the willingness to pay by local public administrations for purchasing such solutions was assessed. The solutions were tested in the inner waters of the Basque coast (South-Eastern Bay of Biscay), these being: the collection of FML by (1) a litter interception riverine barrier; (2) retrofitted fishing vessels engaged in the active Fishing for Litter; (3) sea-cleaning vessels operated with and without (4) a smart decision-support tool (LEMA Tool). The efficiency was measured by the cost of removing 1 kg of FML and comparing it to other alternative technologies; the effectiveness by a comparison of costs and benefits of removing marine litter for the local fisheries, aquaculture, ports and shipping and tourism sectors; and the willingness to pay was evaluated by Contingent Valuation Method. Results show that the density of FML affects the outcome of the efficiency, effectiveness, and willingness to pay and in return, the density depends on the operating ground and the season of the year among other factors. The most efficient solution is the cleaning vessels (4–7 EUR/kg of FML), followed by the Fishing for Litter fishing vessels (4–75 EUR/kg). LEMA Tool may improve the efficiency of both, fishing vessels and cleaning vessel, but the relative improvement depends on the knowledge of the fishers, the accuracy of the sea surface circulation models and again the local litter density. The barrier proved to be the least efficient solution (103 EUR/kg) and its efficiency depends on the river characteristics. Cleaning vessels are an effective solution, fishing vessel may be effective depending on the operating area among other variables.

Seas and oceans, the largest biomes of the biosphere, show increasing numbers of degraded habitats. Ecological restoration offers a major tool to reverse this trend and recover biodiversity, along with human health and well-being. The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration promotes global-scale restoration of degraded habitats and we can exploit lessons learned from terrestrial restoration projects to improve and accelerate marine ecosystem restoration science, practice, and policy. Nonetheless, major differences in land and sea limit direct transfer of terrestrial approaches. Limited ecosystem baselines, greater stochasticity and connectivity, longer timescales needed for effective restoration, associated high costs and advanced technologies required to access and intervene in marine environments (especially in the deep sea), and difficulty in scaling up restoration efforts all hinder the effectiveness and expansion of marine ecosystem restoration. Pilot actions in European waters over ca 5 years in the EU-funded MERCES consortium (Marine Ecosystem Restoration in Changing European Seas) have identified and developed new, promising tools and strategies to catalyze restoration actions, including engagement of funding organizations, governmental bodies, scientists, and citizens. We are now better positioned to implement restoration actions on a wide range of protected, vulnerable, and critical marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, algal forests, shallow rocky shore, and even some deep-sea habitats.

Surrounded by deserts on all sides, the Red Sea is subjected to high dust inputs and receives very little freshwater input, and so harbors a high salinity. Coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangroves flourish in this environment and provide socio-economic and environmental benefits to the bordering coastlines and countries. Interestingly, while coral reef ecosystems are currently experiencing rapid decline on a global scale, those in the Red Sea appear to be in relatively better shape. That said, they are certainly not immune to the stressors that cause degradation, such as increasing ocean temperature, acidification and pollution. In many regions, ecosystems are already severely deteriorating and are further threatened by increasing population pressure and large coastal development projects. Degradation of these marine habitats will lead to environmental costs, as well as significant economic losses. Therefore, it will result in a missed opportunity for the bordering countries to develop a sustainable blue economy and integrate innovative nature-based solutions. Recognizing that securing the Red Sea ecosystems’ future must occur in synergy with continued social and economic growth, we developed an action plan for the conservation, restoration, and growth of marine environments of the Red Sea. We then investigated the level of resources for financial and economic investment that may incentivize these activities. This study presents a set of commercially viable financial investment strategies, ecological innovations, and sustainable development opportunities, which can, if implemented strategically, help ensure long-term economic benefits while promoting environmental conservation. We make a case for investing in blue natural capital and propose a strategic development model that relies on maintaining the health of natural ecosystems to safeguard the Red Sea’s sustainable development. © Copyright © 2021 Cziesielski, Duarte, Aalismail, Al-Hafedh, Anton, Baalkhuyur, Baker, Balke, Baums, Berumen, Chalastani, Cornwell, Daffonchio, Diele, Farooq, Gattuso, He, Lovelock, Mcleod, Macreadie, Marba, Martin, Muniz-Barreto, Kadinijappali, Prihartato, Rabaoui, Saderne, Schmidt-Roach, Suggett, Sweet, Statton, Teicher, Trevathan-Tackett, Joydas, Yahya and Aranda.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2020.603722,blue carbon;blue economy;coral reefs;environmental policy;marine policy;Red Sea ecosystems;sustainability,,,10.3389/fmars.2020.603722,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2020.603722,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.603722) OR,,,,,

While most global circulation models show an increase in the intensity and duration of seasonal upwelling at high latitudes under future human-induced warmer conditions, projections for the North Atlantic are still ambiguous. Due to the low temporal resolution of coastal upwelling records, little is known about the impact of natural forcing mechanisms on upwelling variability. Here, we present a microfossil-based proxy record and modeling simulations for the warmest period of the Holocene (ca. 9-5 ka) to estimate the contribution of the natural variability in North Atlantic upwelling via atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. We found that more frequent high-pressure conditions in the eastern North Atlantic associated with solar activity and orbital parameters triggered upwelling variations at multidecadal and millennial time scales, respectively. Our new findings offer insights into the role of external forcing mechanisms in upwelling changes before the Anthropocene, which must be considered when producing future projections of midlatitude upwelling activity. © 2021 The Authors.

Traditional activities such as fisheries, but also undersea mining, tourism, and scientific research are included, as well as the phenomenal growth of aquaculture during the past decade. All of these activities, and the irresistible prospect of another new frontier, has led to enthusiastic and, most likely, overenthusiastic assessments of the possibilities to exploit the sea to feed the world, provide low-cost energy, become a new source of minerals, and other future miracles. This book makes sense of these trends and of the future of the blue economy by following our remote ancestors who gradually discovered the sea and its resources, describing the so-called fisherman's curse - or why fishermen have always been poor, explaining why humans tend to destroy the resources on which we depend, and assessing the realistic expectations for extracting resources from the sea. Although the sea is not so badly overexploited as the land, our demands on ecosystem services are already above the oceans' sustainability limits.

In this perspective, we present a transdisciplinary approach based on the Delphi method for mapping and evaluating Marine Protected Areas for their ability to protect biodiversity while providing Ecosystem Services (ES) and related human well-being benefits – i.e., the ecosystem outputs from which people benefit.

Advances in freshwater aquaculture have promoted Bangladesh to the fifth largest fish producer in the world. However, the marine resource base of Bangladesh, which is now even greater following the recent settling of disputes regarding maritime boundaries with neighbouring countries, lends itself to the development of marine aquaculture—known as mariculture. Several potential areas and opportunities for mariculture development have been identified for implementation under the concept of blue economy development in Bangladesh. We identify the most promising fish species as the hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha), seabass (Lates calcarifer) and the grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), and the shrimp species as black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), brown shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros), Indian white shrimp (Penaeus indicus) and the mud crab (Scylla serata). Further, some non-traditional marine species like seaweed, microalgae, shellfish (mussel, oyster) and the sea cucumber offer considerable potential. However, there remain major challenges and constraints that need to be addressed in order for mariculture to further develop and contribute to a growing blue economy in Bangladesh. Most notably, ministries, departments and research institutions, along with interested private entrepreneurs, must collaborate to formulate strategies for effective development and implementation, so that mariculture can contribute to food security and economic development through export opportunities. © 2021, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s10499-020-00643-9,Blue economy development;Collaboration;Constraints;Mariculture;Potential;Bangladesh;Decapoda (Crustacea);Fenneropenaeus indicus;Holothuroidea;Lates calcarifer;Metapenaeus monoceros;Mugil cephalus;Ostreidae;Penaeus monodon;Scylla;Tenualosa ilisha;economic development;export;food security;mariculture;marine resource;resource development,,,10.1007/s10499-020-00643-9,DOI(,10.1007/s10499-020-00643-9,DOI(10.1007/s10499-020-00643-9) OR,,,,,

Although most jobs will not require advanced degrees in engineering or science, the preparation of the 21st century ocean technology workforce demands an understanding of marine science and other disciplines, an ability to resolve complex environmental issues, and the ability to communicate complex ideas to a broad audience. Fostering these critical abilities will require a new set of learning opportunities. Developing and maintaining such a workforce will rely on innovative and flexible educational programs that break through the traditional “siloed” approach to education, while offering multiple and rapid pathways for degree and certification attainment.

This article provides a review of scholarly and policy attention paid to these social groups and their means of struggle. It argues that the latest dominant governance discourse tying mangroves to blue carbon signifies a departure from catering to coastal people's interests and rights in mangroves. We describe the evolving discourses that have shaped mangrove use and conservation in the Philippines since the 1970s. While the mid-century preoccupation with mangrove conversion to fish farms gradually gave way to the pursuit of community-based mangrove conservation in the late 1980s and 1990s, recent experiences suggest a comparably weakened focus towards recognizing local access and use patterns. We contend that the present blue carbon framing of mangroves, which harbours technocratic and financialized ideals of sustainability, poses a fundamental disadvantage to local users of mangroves.

The installed capacity of offshore wind power in China reached 4445 MW in 2018 which was ranked third in the world. Big developers dominated the offshore wind energy market with domestic turbines. Many projects are under construction. The offshore wind industry in China has experienced four stages of price policy: demonstration, concession, feed-in tariff and market-oriented competition policy. Nevertheless, it is impossible to expand the installed capacity, lower the on-grid price (cost) and reduce the subsidy for the offshore wind power industry at the same time. This is the trilemma (impossible trinity) that needs to be addressed by the price policy. In the past decade, China has implemented an evolving price policy, i.e., a system and mechanism that encourage firms to invest in the offshore wind industry to expand the capacity of the industry by setting price and providing subsidy and other benefits. An overall evaluation based on the indicators of installed capacity, price, subsidy, spatial distribution, technology and industrial linkage shows that the price policy has been effective in balancing capacity, price and subsidy up to now. However, lowering the price and reducing the subsidy will be the major challenges that China has to overcome in the coming years in order to sustain its current growth trend. To boost the development of its offshore wind industry further, China needs to implement a market-oriented competition price policy and mechanism, learn from the experience of price policy evolution in European countries and open the market to foreign investors. © 2020 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,positive",10.1016/j.rser.2020.110366,Blue economy;Climate change;Energy policy;Governance;Low-carbon;Marine economy;Offshore wind;Price policy;Subsidy;Trilemma;Wind energy;Wind power capacity;Carbon;Commerce;Competition;Investments;Offshore oil well production;Wind power;Blue economies;Low carbon;Offshore winds;Wind industry;China,,,10.1016/j.rser.2020.110366,DOI(,,,,,,,

The potential paths toward these activities rely on identifying the most profitable and competitive blue sectors. First, the 26 kinds of blue products in five major blue industries, marine fishery, the marine chemical industry, marine agroforestry, the marine shipbuilding industry and marine equipment manufacturing, are selected. Examples from China and the United States in 1995, 2005 and 2015 are used to depict the evolutionary characteristics of the blue product space of two countries. Second, product spaces for 34 countries and regions in 2005, 2009 and 2013 are established, and the maximum proximity of each blue product to the products with high revealed comparative advantage (RCA) is calculated. The results show that the maximum proximity between blue products and products with high RCA values positively affects the growth potential of blue products.

For example, fisheries are an essential source of income and food security for billions of people, yet bycatch poses a major threat to marine biodiversity, creating trade-offs between economic growth and biodiversity conservation. This Perspective explores bycatch levies as a market-based instrument for reconciling these trade-offs. We outline the theory and practice of bycatch levies to demonstrate how they could incentivize bycatch prevention and raise revenue for compensatory conservation, provided they are well designed, as part of a policy mix for sustainable and equitable ocean governance. We then explore ways forward for mainstreaming bycatch levies into the blue economy. While compensatory bycatch mitigation has been controversial, increasing adoption of net outcome approaches to biodiversity conservation suggests they could become mainstreamed within the next decade. Bycatch levies could raise billions of dollars towards closing global biodiversity financing gaps, delivering net outcomes for biodiversity under the United Nations Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework while enabling blue growth, and moving towards win–wins for economic welfare and biodiversity conservation. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1038/s41559-021-01444-w,Biodiversity;Conservation of Natural Resources;Ecosystem;Fisheries;Humans;biodiversity;ecosystem;environmental protection;fishery;human,,,10.1038/s41559-021-01444-w,DOI(,10.1038/s41559-021-01444-w,DOI(10.1038/s41559-021-01444-w) OR,,,,,

Given the inherent socio-economic and geopolitical complexity of the region, this approach has been recognized as essential to address the challenges associated with the interconnected nature of shared ecosystem goods and services upon which countries in the region depend. This paper uses a retrospective lens to shed light on the challenges confronting the region and its efforts to overcome them. It is based on the Large Marine Ecosystem Governance Framework developed specifically for the WCR in 2006 and characterized as “learning by doing.” Data were obtained for this study through desktop review of published literature documenting progress over the period 2001–2021 and insights requested from 15 key individual and institutional contributors involved in the initiative. While the lack of financial resources was an underpinning and cross-cutting issue, key constraints identified were categorized as institutional, capacity building, awareness raising, leadership, legal, political, social capital, or socio-cultural. They include national capacity to engage with regional level processes due to a variety of factors including funding, political, and institutional challenges of developing a regional coordination mechanism, engaging the broader ocean community to create the critical mass needed, the difficulty of mainstreaming ocean affairs into high level political and decision-making fora and the scarcity of local, national and regional technical and political champions.

Climate change has been severely affecting the ecological and socio-economic development but these effects can be mitigated by supporting sustainable technological and economic development as AMs and MPs. MPs to climate change may trade off the negative impacts of GCC and exploring and employing lucrative opportunities in blue economy can help in developing those AMs and MPs. Moreover, it is not possible to rapidly divert all global manufacturing processes into benign technological and economic perfection.

The state, as the dominant structure in the world, enables the realization of sustainable maritime transport aims through its instruments. Therefore, it is very significant to consider the national maritime policies because the effective implementation of the global policy is impossible without considering the adequate mechanisms at the state level. The adopted Montenegrin strategic documents impact the institutional framework set-up of the Blue Economy (BE) sectors and potentials for eco-logically sustainable maritime transport. Although there are no practical directions for the sustainable use of sea resources, Montenegro is affirmatively oriented to the BE concept. Knowing that Montenegro is in the process of the pre-accessing EU phase, it is of importance to be on the right road to creating a national maritime transport policy including environmental practices, to become part of the strategic implementation of the BE. The paper provides recommendations that can serve for the successful follow-up of the BE activities in Montenegro and the wider area. © 2021 by the authors.

The spar-buoy oscillating-water-column wave energy converter concept, typically studied for large scale wave energy production, can be re-designed to meet the power requirements of such applications, which results in a much smaller device working outside resonance conditions under typical sea states, and therefore with a smaller energy conversion efficiency. Experimental results are presented for a 1:10th scale model of a spar-buoy oscillating-water-column, undertaken in a wave channel. Calibrated orifice plates were used to model the flow characteristic of an impulse turbine, which will be used in the full-scale system. The system performance is examined for regular and irregular wave conditions. The results show the presence of non-linear effects, caused by viscous flow and turbine damping. A capture width ratio matrix is generated through stochastic modelling using regular-wave data and the performance of the device is assessed for two locations with different wave energy resource. The device presents an annual-averaged power of approximately 1kW for an Atlantic wave climate, and an annual-averaged power of approximately 0.4kW for a Mediterranean wave climate, which makes it adequate for the supply of specific oceanographic equipment in the first location, while for the second location a larger buoy should be considered. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included }",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116835,Blue economy;Off-grid applications;Spar-buoy oscillating-water-column;Stochastic analysis;Wave energy conversion;Buoys;Conversion efficiency;Data acquisition;Desalination;Energy resources;Location;Ocean currents;Offshore oil well production;Stochastic models;Blue economies;Low Power;Off-grid application;Oscillating water column;Power;Wave climates;Wave energy;Wave energy converters;alternative energy;calibration;data acquisition;desalination;efficiency measurement;energy resource;equipment;experimental study;oscillation;water column;wave energy;Stochastic systems,,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116835,DOI(,,,,,,,

Yet this potential is being overshadowed by competing uses of ocean resources in an accelerating “blue economy.” The current emphasis on production growth, rather than equitable distribution of benefits, has created three unexamined or flawed assumptions that growth in the blue economy will lead to growth in “blue food” production, increased production will inevitably lead to improved food and nutrition security, and mariculture production will replace marine capture fisheries. In this perspective, we argue that if research and policies are pursued without addressing these “blind spots,” blue food contributions to reducing hunger and malnutrition, and to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, will be limited.

In 2014, EU member states set new strategies to support sustainable aquaculture and ambitious targets of productions to be met by 2020 in the three segments, marine fish, freshwater fish and shellfish. A recent assessment made by the European Commission concludes that some countries might not be able to attain the established goals and this paper presents an in-depth analysis of such strategies to identify the social constraints hampering aquaculture growth in France, Italy and Spain as well as the measures established to overcome them. Most of the identified issues are related to the social acceptability of local communities, local stakeholders and consumers, suggesting that this still represents an unsolved issue hampering aquaculture development in Europe. In fact, our results show that (a) the sector suffers from a bad image related to its environmental impacts; (b) a lack of integrated spatial planning is leading to increasing conflicts with other activities; and (c) there is predominance of top-down consultation mechanisms. It is concluded that there is not a single solution to enhance social acceptability of aquaculture since this depends on a number of social, economic and environmental factors that may differ from site to site, and countries need to adopt a more integrated approach where concerns of local communities and stakeholders are understood and taken into account. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,aquaculture",10.1111/raq.12540,aquaculture;blue economy;integrated management;public consultation;social acceptability;Italy;France;Spain;European Union;Social Support,,,10.1111/raq.12540,DOI(,10.1111/raq.12540,DOI(10.1111/raq.12540) OR,,,,,

In particular, this has led to new paradigm: circular economy. It is described under different terms such as biomimicry, industrial ecology, natural capitalism, blue economy, regenerative design, and closing loops. Particularly sensitive and aware of the depletion of his natural resources due to anthropogenic factors, Morocco is engaged in the way of remediation through different sectors, known for their direct impact on the environment and health. The main activities that retain attention of the national strategy include best management of solid waste (that includes municipal wastes, plastics waste, e-wastes, industrial and hazardous wastes, bio medical wastes, and construction and demolition wastes), wastewater and sludge, agricultural waste, end-of-life of vehicle wastes, renewable energy and electricity. To achieve sustainable development, natural resources have to be preserved and their exploitation has to be rationalized. Also, natural resources consumption should be rationalized and resource recovery should be maximized. This approach needs to be supported by the national legislative framework. Moroccan approach is based on existing legislation guided by different legal texts concerning the environment and backed by different national plans related to different sectors. This have paved the way to the involvement of private sectors (NGOs) to contribute in public–private project (PPP) in order to achieve targets in terms of investments and efficiency. The objective of this chapter is to provide and to overview the status of implementation of Circular Economy in Morocco supported by 3R (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) concepts. Results of this strategy are reflected in the degree of achievement of the projects currently ongoing or planned for each sector. © The Editor (s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021, corrected publication 2022.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included }",10.1007/978-981-16-0913-8_2,Circular Economy;Industrial Ecology;Morocco;Regenerative design,,,10.1007/978-981-16-0913-8_2,DOI(,,,,,,,

To date there is limited guidance into how a Blue Economy should be enacted. We propose four initial steps in the development of Blue Economy policies and plans. Firstly, we argue for early deliberation over what is meant by the Blue Economy within the relevant context. Secondly, consideration of the sectors that make up a Blue Economy should be articulated. Thirdly, we argue that Blue Economy plans should aim to be coherent within the existing policy framework. Therefore, an assessment is required of the existing policy settings for the relevant marine and coastal sectors, and the degree to which they are already coherent, or ‘mutually consistent’ with each other. Finally, a contextually sensitive and coherent Blue Economy policy can be designed which plugs policy gaps and adds value to the existing situation. We test the application of these four steps in two different case study areas, a region of Australia and Timor Leste.

Blue growth was introduced as a catch-all approach to exploring and exploiting marine resources, however, approaches to blue growth varied due to ambiguity in how blue growth has been defined and applied. While the concept of blue growth has been used as a mechanism for the management of marine sectors, no concise universally adopted definition of blue growth exists which has resulted in the mismanagement of marine resources. This research defines blue growth as the sustainable development of marine resources, generating livelihoods, and securing well-being, from innovation in emerging marine sectors. With this definition of blue growth in mind, this research asks what are the influencing factors that nurture blue growth? To answer this question, this research leverages the findings of consultative stakeholder workshops in five coastal regions along the western Atlantic seaboard. The research shows that some of the nurturing factors include geography and absorptive capacity building to develop marine sectors sustainably. This research looks at blue growth development through the triple helix lens, focusing on how collaborative efforts between the stakeholders can be utilized to build absorptive capacities and identify commercial opportunities. Effectively utilizing blue growth strategies by targeting these antecedent factors could ensure a balanced approach to economic development and the sustainable development. Understanding the influencing factors of blue growths provides a pathway to overcoming the blue growth dilemma managing sustainable development and realizing commercial opportunities to ensure the development of a sustainable blue economy.  © 2021 MTS.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,non-targeted",10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705960,Blue growth;Regional economic development;Sustainable blue economy;Sustainable development;Triple helix;Coastal zones;Economic and social effects;Economics;Marine biology;Planning;Regional planning;Absorptive capacity;Blue economies;Coastal regions;Environmental forces;Marine resources;Marine sector;Triple helixes,,,10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705960,DOI(,10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705960,DOI(10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705960) OR,,,,,

However, there is a vast and recent economic literature on the subject, which is confused and often contradictory, negatively affecting the international debate and policymaking. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to dot the I’s and cross the T’s on this literature, which frequently uses a wide nuance of terms as synonyms, such as blue economy, marine economy, maritime economics, ocean economy, economy of the sea, blue growth, coastal economy, and maritime cluster. Thus, it is necessary to explain the differences between these “fifty shades of blue” economy concepts, specifically because of the relevance of the topic in the Decade of Ocean Science, which often seems limited and misunderstood.

Understanding such network and their holistic potential impact on the efficiency of port performance is scarcely addressed in the context of larger dialogue on port efficiency. Such an analysis is paramount when deeper levels of economic integration and spatially competitive ports are considered to be co joint twins. Further, efficiency gains of ports have received much academic attention in view of total quality management which focuses on customer delight and thus customer retention. It is this regard; the present paper tries to make an infant endeavour in terms of measuring terminal efficiency with respect to the turnaround time which would include export cycle time and import cycle time of CFS (a potential outsourcing activity of a port).

Thus, the chapter aims at filling this gap through clarification of whether these concepts are complementary or, opposite, alternative to each other. The study shows that the change of colors for economic concepts is about the shift of the economy and nature interrelation insight. To a certain extent, the green economy emerges from anthropocentrism focused on the greening technologies, while the circular economy reflects the paradigmatic change, concentrating at flow-thinking regarding the resource’s movement, the closeness of the man-made cycle and its safe integration into the natural one. The new vision of a social-economic system, functioning in congruity with nature displaces the human dominant model.

Every drop of oil that is prevented from polluting the Ocean will make the Blue Economy a truly Green Economy and every life saved from being lost in accidents, in the recycling yards will truly make every Ship-Recycling yard a safer workplace. Alang (Gujarat-India), one of the world’s biggest ship-breaking yards, recycles about 300 of the 1000 ships that are demolished per annum globally and with India ratifying the Hong Kong convention this number is bound to go up manifold soon. The two most important aspects of the Hong Kong convention namely, environmentally friendly and labour safety, are directly related to making a scrap ship completely gas-free before being permitted to enter the recycling yard. Although recycling yards are claiming compliance with this convention, it appears that its implementation is not taking place as desired, thereby defeating the very purpose of this convention. When a product tanker goes for a grade change, the amount of cleaning carried out and efforts made to ensure that cargo tanks are free from the residues of previous cargo, including all kinds of un-broachable oil that may remain in the pumps, pipe-lines or tank bottoms, is humongous. Depending on the size of the tanker, it may take up to a week to completely remove all the traces of residues. Since the commercial interest of the shipowner/charterer is involved, best efforts are made to do the job most professionally, but in the case of a ship that is being scrapped, since the deal has already been done, it is most unlikely that the shipowner would show similar enthusiasm or concern in making the ship gas-free and make it safe for carrying out hot work. Are the people inspecting the ship before permitting its entry into the recycling yard determined to ensure that the ship is absolutely Gas free, before issuing it a Gas Free certificate? Only the number of accidents and the marine pollution incidents will tell the tale. The data was collected through a survey of shipping companies operating tankers and through appropriate authorities at Alang Ship-recycling yard. The extensive experience of the Author and his colleagues in Tanker operations (Over 20 Years) was utilized in the analysis of data. Only the involvement of third-party experts from the field in Tank cleaning and gas freeing operations can pave the way to safe & environmental friendly Tanker recycling. © 2021 21st Annual General Assembly, IAMU AGA 2021 - Proceedings of the International Association of Maritime Universities ,IAMU Conference.

However, coastal upwelling along the Taiwan east coast has received little attention from the research community. This study used five-year daily Himawari-8 geostationary satellite sea surface temperature data to map the coastal upwelling east of Taiwan during the summer monsoon season. We applied a semi-automatic image process technique based on the topographic position index for the quantitative upwelling mapping. The results show clear evidence of seasonal coastal upwelling along the entire Taiwan east coast, mainly under the influence of upwelling-favorable southwesterly/southerly winds. There are three broad upwelling centers along the Taiwan east coast: north, central, and south.

A novel approach that is being applied within this new conservation finance frontier is the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance. By synthesizing recent literatures in political ecology on the notion of rent and the biopolitics of nature, this article explores how the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance can be seen as a technique that is mobilized for governing ecosystem rents biopolitically. The article urges political ecologists to pay attention to how biopolitics and governance of rents intersect in market-based environmental governance.While surveying the breadth of projects that involves both adaptation and insurance, I pay particular attention to a parametric coral reef insurance that was recently introduced in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. Such a project, this article argues, involves reconceptualizing the coral reef as an infrastructure that provides benefits – ultimately rents – to the local tourist industry and indirectly the state, but this coral infrastructure is itself in need of being protected through insurance as a biopolitical measure that can ensure the future life of the coral reef by rendering calculable uncertain, future climate threats to the reef. By reconceptualizing ecosystems as infrastructure that can be insured, the notion of ecosystem-based adaptation operationalizes otherwise systematic risks posed by climate change and biodiversity loss on a local scale. Finally, I highlight some of the complications that are involved when insurance is used as a biopolitical means of making nature live. © 2021.

The case of Brazil’s Public Expenditure Review (PER) of tax exemption and subsidies applied to ocean related economic activities from 2011 to 2018 opens the debate. The extra-budgetary PER is applied with the Rio Markers from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the economic activities listed by the World Bank´s Blue Economy, Ocean Decade’s results and Sustainable Development Goal 14 targets. The data on tax exemption and subsidies was obtained from official sources, from the Federal Government Budget System maintained by the Ministry of Economy. The screening was carried out for all national level tax relief and subsidies applied during 2011 and 2018. There were 316.4 billion reais (US$ 80.2 billion) spent by Brazil’s Federal government on ocean-related economic activities, either directly or indirectly, through subsidies and tax relief over 2011-2018. The accumulated GDP over that period was equivalent to 45.9 billion reais (US$ 11.6 billion). The sector that most benefitted is Agriculture (includes fishing), which received around 229.1 billion reais (US$ 58.0 billion) in incentives during this period.

The authors make recommendations on the scientific knowledge needs and co-design actions identified during two consultations, part of the Decade preparatory-phase, framing them in the Mediterranean Sea’s unique environmental and socio-economic perspectives. According to the ‘Mediterranean State of the Environment and Development Report 2020’ by the United Nations Environment Programme Mediterranean Action Plan and despite notable progress, the Mediterranean region is not on track to achieve and fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030. Key factors are the cumulative effect of multiple human-induced pressures that threaten the ecosystem resources and services in the global change scenario. The basin, identified as a climate change vulnerability hotspot, is exposed to pollution and rising impacts of climate change. This affects mainly the coastal zones, at increasing risk of extreme events and their negative effects of unsustainable management of key economic assets. Transitioning to a sustainable blue economy is the key for the marine environment’s health and the nourishment of future generations. This challenging context, offering the opportunity of enhancing the knowledge to define science-based measures as well as narrowing the gaps between the Northen and Southern shores, calls for a joint (re)action. The paper reviews the state of the art of Mediterranean Sea science knowledge, sets of trends, capacity development needs, specific challenges, and recommendations for each Decade’s societal outcome. In the conclusions, the proposal for a Mediterranean regional programme in the framework of the Ocean Decade is addressed. The core objective relies on integrating and improving the existing ocean-knowledge, Ocean Literacy, and ocean observing capacities building on international cooperation to reach the “Mediterranean Sea that we want”. © 2021 The authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,non-targeted",10.1590/2675-2824069.21019mc,Co-design;Marine science;Mediterranean Sea;Ocean Decade;Sustainable Development Goals,,,10.1590/2675-2824069.21019mc,DOI(,10.1590/2675-2824069.21019mc,DOI(10.1590/2675-2824069.21019mc) OR,,,,,

Such cooperation has become important to the extent that there are different approaches among Member States in controlling such investments and applying their respective national regulations on so-called “golden power”. The exercise of these special powers by Member State governments is now extended to several strategic sectors for the national economy, such as energy, health, communications, as well as transport and ports. The latter, through which 75% of non-EU trade passes and which are the privileged access point for the supply of raw materials, have in recent years been the target on the part of mainly Asian companies (often State owned), which have taken over major commercial terminals and, in European ports where this is legally possible, even control of the governance of the Port Authorities. In this note, after an illustration of the above mentioned European legislation and of the recent initiatives carried out by the EU Commission in the framework of the industry strategy, are identified the investments in the port sector that could fall under the application of the golden power.

Custom made monitoring and data transmission sensory units were developed and placed on the quay crane spreader and AGV to detect the movement speed and the accelerations in 3D space. Theoretical and use-case scenarios are presented and discussed briefly. Initial results suggested that crane operators’ involvement in the control of the cargo movement produced incorrect control patterns (joystick movements) that delayed port operations. Each control movement of the joystick needs to have direct real-time feedback from the spreader (actual movement of the cargo).

The Blue Growth, a knowledge driven exploitation of the marine resources, is a target that EU and many other countries have set to improve the societal wellbeing. In particular the Mediterranean has still unexploited potentials to provide very specific ecosystem services and new technologies in order to contribute to economic growth. To this aim, the European Commission funded the Bluemed project (2016-2020), which involves nine different European countries (Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain) and their relevant stakeholders in the definition of shared strategies at national and international level; the Italian National Research Council (CNR) coordinates Bluemed. Given this framework, the present paper, starts from the main outcomes of Bluemed on research and innovation in the Mediterranean, through a detailed analysis of the most relevant activities and thematic objectives for some of the main marine and maritime socio-economic drivers (transport, tourism, energy have been chosen). Then, on that basis and with the support of a deep literature overview, it tries to understand the present status of some relevant sectors for their potential impact on technology and innovation on this maritime area, highlighting the main obstacles to the fulfilment of the planned priorities and proposing possible strategies to overcome them; all this starting from an Italian perspective. The emphasis is put just on the gaps and barriers to Blue Growth, and on the ways to overcome them, to help the identification of cross-cutting high-level priorities and actions for research and innovation, to be shared at national and Mediterranean level. The main contribution of the work presented here is the recognition that concrete steps towards a “Blue” economy can be achieved only by going beyond the identification of research and innovation challenges and priorities for specific sectors, since they necessarily reflect a partial, sectorial view, and that the main effort must be directed towards an integrated view of how different activities, often conflicting, might coexists. Another finding is the planning of roadmaps to follow so that new technologies/knowledge could overcome those conflicts. As a consequence, the aim and the output of the paper is not proposing a further detailed list of Research and Innovation priorities, but is instead trying to identify how the most relevant R&I challenges for Blue Growth already available can be more efficiently pursued following the roadmaps proposed in the paper.

The study argues that more active commercialisation of territorial resources can facilitate the sustainable economic development of the BSR coastal territories, following digitally-driven innovations. The paper provides an overview of methodological approaches to territorial sustainability. It also assesses the 2009—2018 level of the socio-economic development of the BSR coastal territories, underpins the importance of the blue economy and highlights the role of digital transformation in reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the BSR through digitally-driven innovations. A comparative and problem-targeted statistics analyses show significant differences in the dynamics of socio-economic development in the BSR coastal territories with their GRP per capita being generally lower than the national or macroregional average. A review of literature on sustainable development in the BSR has shown that a more active use of the unique resources of coastal territories along with a technology-driven growth of the blue economy sectors can counterbalance the negative impact of the uneven development of these territories on the progress towards the SDGs in the BSR. Increasing the competitiveness of the BSR coastal territories requires investment in digital solutions in the blue economy sectors and building communication infrastructure. The review of key innovations in the blue economy sectors shows that their implementation gives impetus to other industries by reducing costs, creating new jobs, and improving the quality of products and services. © Roos, G., Kubina, N.

Utilizing generic frequency domain representations of the Oscilla Power Triton WEC and spectral wave conditions at PacWave (Oregon), Los Angeles (California) and WETS (Hawaii), a series of interesting results emerge. Firstly, the ‘optimal’ WEC size, from an energy standpoint, is fundamentally dependent on the frequency distribution of the incoming wave variance density spectrum. Secondly, and from a seasonality perspective, the seasonal WEC energy generation doesn’t necessarily follow the seasonal distribution of gross wave power. Finally, from an hourly power variability perspective, a reduction in WEC size generally decreases variability. However, for each of the locations investigated, there appears to be a WEC size threshold; a threshold where further reducing WEC size results in increased power variability. © European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference 2021.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",,Blue Economy;Wave resource assessment;Wave Spectrum;WEC Modelling;Frequency domain analysis;Tidal power;Wave energy conversion;Blue economies;Converter modeling;Power variability;Resource assessments;Spatial and temporal variability;Wave energy converter modeling;Wave energy converters;Wave resource;Wave spectrum;Wave power,,,Wave resource spatial and temporal variability dependence on wec size,TITLE(,Wave resource spatial and temporal variability dependence on wec size,TITLE(Wave resource spatial and temporal variability dependence on wec size) OR,,,,,

With the recent interest in the Blue Economy, this is about to change. Point Wave Energy Converter (PWEC) absorbs the wave energy at a single point and is characterized by the buoy surface component and a longer subsurface component that is attached to the seabed. The motion of the top buoy is used to pump fluid or drive a linear generator, which in turn provides power. This paper numerically investigates different shaped surface buoys, with a focus on the power-generating ability of the system, for a single point WEC using a non-linear free surface approximation. Three-dimensional simulations of the buoys in various sea states were modeled in OpenFOAM using Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations with Finite Volume Method (FVM). The dynamic mesh module was integrated with the two-phase solver, and the mechanical system of the WEC was modeled with a forced oscillator mechanism. By studying the displacements, frequency responses, and design parameters, the optimal buoy shape for maximizing energy output was determined. Further, the guidance regarding the effect of changes in the geometry, represented by the length to diameter ratio of the shape, is discussed. The results showed that the spheroid buoy shape with a low length to diameter ratio is a good candidate shape to extract wave energy since it has a large waterplane area. © 2021 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,positive",10.5957/SMC-2021-131,Energy harvesting;Finite volume method;Non-linear wave profile;Wave energy converter;Buoys;Frequency response;Navier Stokes equations;Numerical methods;Ocean currents;Wave energy conversion;Finite-volume method;Length to diameter ratio;Moving water;Nonlinear waves;Power;Single point;Wave energy;Wave energy converters;Wave profiles,,,10.5957/SMC-2021-131,DOI(,10.5957/SMC-2021-131,DOI(10.5957/SMC-2021-131) OR,,,,,

For the first time in history, the unpredictability COVID-19 health crisis has shut down the entire social and economic sectors across the globe. The continuous nationwide lockdown has made it very difficult to mobilize vessels and survey crews for bathymetric mapping. With the emerging remote sensing technology, hydrospatial specialists today have too accustomed to live and work in the new normality. Apparently, hydrography is clearly undergoing dramatic change which an expanded role to serve an increasing number of stakeholders in the blue economy. In order to seek the maximum benefits from the adoption of forth industrial revolution (IR4.0) paradigms, utilization of high-technology sensors and various unmanned autonomous crafts for bathymetric data acquisition to generate actionable data and information to serve the hydrographic communities. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, hydrographic communities have been forced to accelerate the adoption of emerging technologies to mitigate its impact. Indeed, satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) has become a recognized tool for acquisition to generate actionable hydrospatial data that can alleviate future economic upheavals.

By segmentizing the training sets to fit into several designated depth zones, this sequential ensemble fitting approach demonstrates better performance if compares to the traditional single regression algorithm. Derived conclusion points out that newly proposed method can enhance the current bathymetric mapping capability and deliver precise and accurate actionable hydrospatial information in facilitating the emerging demands, in the post COVID-19 era. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",,bathymetry;COVID-19;hydrospatial;multi-zone ensemble fitting;satellite imagery;Data acquisition;Hydrographic surveys;Image enhancement;Mapping;Remote sensing;Satellite imagery;Space applications;Space optics;Acoustic survey;Economic sectors;Health crisis;Hydrospatial;Mapping capabilities;Marine environment;Multi-zone ensemble fitting;Remote sensing technology;Social sector;Bathymetry,,,ENHANCING BATHYMETRIC MAPPING CAPABILITY USING MULTI-ZONE ENSEMBLE FITTING: FACILITATING EMERGING POST COVID-19 DEMANDS,TITLE(,ENHANCING BATHYMETRIC MAPPING CAPABILITY USING MULTI-ZONE ENSEMBLE FITTING: FACILITATING EMERGING POST COVID-19 DEMANDS,TITLE(ENHANCING BATHYMETRIC MAPPING CAPABILITY USING MULTI-ZONE ENSEMBLE FITTING: FACILITATING EMERGING POST COVID-19 DEMANDS) OR,,,,,

Jamaica is a developing country that is sensitive to climate change, which could have an impact on the country's blue economy and tourism industry. The National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) of Jamaica only collects a percentage of the annual solid waste produced, which is subsequently transferred to dumpsites. The balance is either burned by the local population or illegally disposed of. These practices negatively impact the environment, threatens the sustainability of economic growth from blue economy and tourism and its waste management system is predominantly a cost center. Implementing an MRF could enhance the manufacturing sector, contribute to economic growth, and serve as a catalyst for the development of a green industry with diverse downstream value chains and supply chain connections. There is a global movement toward reuse and recycling, which has resulted in the creation of an international market for recycled solid waste. MRFs allow for the efficient sorting of solid waste into desired recoverable commodities, opening the door to international recycling waste trading. In comparison to similar and more advanced regions, research into the current situation and efforts to enhance waste management in Jamaica is discussed. The research looks into the concept of green industrialisation and how it may help fragile small-state economies like Jamaica. MRFs as a seeding factory can anchor the reverse and forward logistics of other green businesses as part of a logistic-centered economy, according to the study. The research also includes an engineering economic analysis that evaluates the feasibility of implementing an MRF in Jamaica. This study details the probable costs of building and managing an MRF, as well as a realistic cash flow forecast to set a profit benchmark.

Traditional ROV deployments depend upon research vessels for deployment and retrieval. This constrains survey lengths, makes deployments dependent upon sea conditions, and increases costs significantly. Pairing WECs with docking stations to power ROVs presents an opportunity to expand underwater research, seafloor mapping, and a host of Blue Economy applications. A numerical model of a free-floating WEC-ROV system has been built to enhance the understanding of the associated hydrodynamics and energy transfer of the WEC-ROV system. Utilizing a representative Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum with a significant wave height of 0.5 m and peak period of 7 s, a Wave-to-ROV numerical framework is presented, which focuses on representing the WEC’s ability to charge the docking station and power the ROV. This novel simulation, which couples the WEC power generation to ROV dynamics, presents a comprehensive representation of the WEC-ROV system’s hydrodynamics, cable dynamics, and the system’s recharging and docking capability. The model includes representation of the WEC forces, a numerical scheme for ROV motion planning, and the dynamics of the ROV and docking station. The power take-off (PTO) system is characterized by a representative passive spring damper system.

Europe represents one of the leading maritime powers in the world. In 2018, the EU Blue economy generated €750 billion in turnover and €218 billion in gross value added and directly employed about 5 million people. Satellite applications bring an added value in creating innovative and sustainable growth path for many industries, as in the maritime domain. In this context, satellite technology provides marine operators with reliable real-time information while ensuring coverage of vast and unreachable areas. In recent years, maritime operators are facing new challenges: from coastal management to navigation assistance, as well as biodiversity protection and disaster response and management. Satellite data provides a plethora of reliable and easy-to-use solutions for aquaculture, fisheries, algal bloom, safety and security, and coastal development, to name a few. Nevertheless, the take-up of satellite-based solutions is far from being achieved. Scepticism persists from the end- users' side due to a series of factors as a lack of clear communication with service providers; a poor understanding of the benefits related to the integration of satellite-based solutions in their workflow; financial constraints; and a lack of knowledge and competencies for implementing and using satellite-based services efficiently. Recently, Eurisy launched the initiative Space4Maritime. The objective is to identify and understand the needs of European maritime end-user communities, facilitating the dialogue with the space industry and the uptake of satellite services. In this frame, Eurisy started a series of interviews with end-users identified in the blue world. The result of these interviews is the core of the paper. The overall objective is to identify the existing operational solutions applicable in the maritime domain through practical examples, as well as the bottlenecks that harness the potential of satellite applications for the sustainable growth of the Blue Economy. The paper will mainly address service providers and public authorities, providing them with a set of recommendations on how to foster cooperation with maritime operators. But it also targets potential new end-users interested in adopting satellite solutions in their workflow. The case studies will be complemented furtherly by additional information collected through desk research and the organization of thematic webinars.

This has prompted the current interest in the ocean-based economic model as Kenya became the first to host a global conference on the sustainable blue economy which was held in Nairobi in November 2018. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges surrounding the blue economy approach, we used a fractional response model to analyze drivers of marine fishery dependence. Our case study, involving 384 randomly selected households from Coastal lowlands of Kenya, specifically Kilifi County, revealed that marine fishery is the highest livelihood option exhibiting gender differences. The livelihood participation rates were approximately 68%, 36%, 31%, 25%, and 9% for marine fishery and related activities, agriculture, self-employment (excluding agriculture and marine fishery), wage employment, and remittances respectively. Many livelihood options were pursued independently implying a low level of diversified livelihood strategies in the region. The analysis of the determinants of the marine fishery dependence indicated that education level, agricultural productive assets, access to credit, group membership, security of tenure, flood shock, and fish price shock significantly influenced marine fishery dependence. The study therefore recommends government intervention in marine governance and development programs such as infrastructural development, capital availability and extension services. This will enable the dependent households to diversify to alternative livelihood options and contributes to sustainable marine fishery dependence. © 2021 The Author(s).

Consequently, wave energy faces many challenges for expansion and has a wide-ranging design space of WEC concepts. The large design space demands new methods for understanding the potential performance of early-design stage concepts. The Technology Performance Level (TPL) metric has been a proposed method for early-stage concept assessment. However, previous research has shown that the TPL is not designed in such a way that it is able to distinguish between multiple early-stage, low-fidelity concepts. We created a conceptual design tool to complement the TPL assessment to help wave energy developers during the design stage, rather than a quantitative assessment metric. The tool guides marine energy developers during the conceptual design of a wave energy converter by presenting designers with established practices, asking if their concept can meet these practices and constraints, and providing design feedback based on the answers. In this paper, we document the architecture, content, and results from our first tests of the tool. While limited in the number of participants, this study serves as a proof of concept of the tool’s ability to impact design decisions during concept generation. These results also provide insight for further improvement of the tool’s structure and content. Creating awareness of oversights early in the design process will help wave energy developers effectively engage stakeholder requirements, increasing the appeal of a wave energy converter concept to marine energy stakeholders. © European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference 2021.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",,Conceptual design;Design tool;Engineering design;Wave energy converter;Tidal power;Wave energy conversion;Wind power;Blue economies;Design spaces;Marine energy;Performance;Performance:level;Technology performance;Wave energy;Wave energy converters,,,A conceptual design tool for high-performance wave energy converters for blue economy applications,TITLE(,A conceptual design tool for high-performance wave energy converters for blue economy applications,TITLE(A conceptual design tool for high-performance wave energy converters for blue economy applications) OR,,,,,

Representing almost half of global production, marine aquaculture will contribute to sustainably feeding the growing humanity. However, climate change will undoubtedly challenge the future growth of marine aquaculture. Temperature and sea-level rise, shifts in precipitation, freshening from glacier melt, changing ocean productivity, and circulation patterns, increasing occurrence of extreme climatic events, eutrophication, and ocean acidification are all stressors that will influence marine aquaculture. The objective of this themed article set was to bring together contributions on the broad theme of the potential impacts, adaptation, and mitigation strategies of marine aquaculture to climate change. Here we present 14 papers covering a diverse set of approaches including experimentation, modelling, meta-analysis and review, and disciplines like biology, ecology, economics, and engineering. These articles focus on the impacts of climate change-related stressors on the aquaculture potential itself and on the resulting ecological interactions (e.g. parasitism and predation), on phenotypic plasticity and adaptation potential of species, and on measures to mitigate the effects of climate change on aquaculture and vice versa. Considering this, adaptation of the aquaculture sector relies on anticipating the biogeographical changes in the distribution of species, determining their potential for adaptation and selective breeding for resistance or tolerance to climate-induced stressors, and fostering ecosystem resilience by means of conservation, restoration, or remediation. By will or by force, aquaculture will contribute to the low carbon economy of tomorrow. Aquaculture must move towards a new paradigm where the carbon footprint and the analysis of the life cycle of products are at least as important as economic profitability. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.

A significant difference is noticed between male and female beneficiaries for preference to all the variables except enhanced waste management practices variable (insignificant difference- 0.183; Mann-Whitney U test). All the variables significantly advance the livelihood sustainability of ecosystem-dependent population and the ecosystem service evaluation process. The present survey also resulted that the better sustainability of blue economy involved the significant implementation of growth agendas by minimizing the effluent and sewage disposal, developmental activities in industrial areas, disaster outbreak and eliminating harmful fishing practices, overfishing and instead incentivizing approaches that promote growth, improve conservation, build sustainable fisheries, and terminate the IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing.

This paper discusses two interconnected aspects of regional economic systems - their economic efficiency and environmental impact. The analysis focuses on the regions of the Ural Federal District and explores these regions' transition to sustainable development by looking at their eco-intensity. Methodologically, the study relies on the methods of analysis and synthesis, statistical, comparative and causal analysis. Conceptually, we use the theoretical framework of sustainable development as a point of departure for our discussion. The results have shown, on the one hand, a decrease in the industrial pressure on the natural environment, related primarily to the enhanced resource efficiency of certain industries. On the other hand, less effort is now invested into minimising the negative impact on the environment in Ural regions. We have also identified those areas of sustainable development that hold most promise in the Russian context. Our findings can serve as a basis for the strategies of regional sustainable development and may be used for further research on socio-environmental and economic sustainability. © Lavrikova Yu.

Examined in this paper is a traditional tubular oscillating water column device, and particular interest here is in designs that lead to optimization of power converted from shorter wind sea waves. A two step design procedure is investigated here, wherein a more approximate two-degree-of-freedom model is first used to identify relative dimensions (of device elements) that optimize power conversion from relative oscillations between the device elements. A more rigorous mathematical model based on the hydrodynamics of oscillating pressure distributions within solid oscillators is then used to provide the hydrodynamic coefficients, forces, and flow rates for the device.

Mitigating these threats requires public awareness of climate change and its impacts on the marine environment. By using the questionnaire method throughout April and May 2020, a sample of (n = 225) in Egypt was surveyed to assess their awareness of climate change impacts on marine environment. The survey was designed for identification of any gaps in knowledge; analysis of information sources on climate change and marine environment; and investigation of the pro-environmental behaviors individuals undertake to minimize their negative impact on the marine environment. The study has shown variations in results among the different surveyed categories. A significant percentage of the sample lacks the basic knowledge on climate change and its impact on the marine environment, the information sources are mostly unreliable, and their daily routine is not consistent with climate change national and global mitigation actions. It’s concluded that it’s crucial to minimize the knowledge gaps highlighted by this research, minimize the value-action gap, overcoming the barrier of habit and routine is vital to making a pro-environmental behavior viable.

The blue economy and especially the small-scale fisheries sector in India have dwindled due to disruptions in the fish catch, market, and supply chain. This research presents the applicability of satellite data to monitor the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown on the Indian fisheries sector. Three harbors namely Mangrol, Veraval, and Vankbara situated on the north-western coast of India were selected in this study based on characteristics like harbor’s age, administrative control, and availability of cloud-free satellite images. To analyze the impact of COVID in the fisheries sector, we utilized high-resolution PlanetScope data for monitoring and comparison of “area under fishing boats” during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown phases. A support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was used to identify the area under the boats. The classification results were complemented with socio-economic data and ground-level information for understanding the impact of the pandemic on the three sites. During the peak of the lockdown, it was found that the “area under fishing boats” near the docks and those parked on the land area increased by 483%, 189%, and 826% at Mangrol, Veraval, and Vanakbara harbor, respectively. After phase-I of lockdown, the number of parked vessels decreased, yet those already moved out to the land area were not returned until the south-west monsoon was over. A quarter of the annual production is estimated to be lost at the three harbors due to lockdown. Our last observation (September 2020) result shows that regular fishing activity has already been re-established in all three locations.

In partnership with industry and international collaborators, a TPL assessment methodology for grid-connected wave energy farms has been developed by applying a systems engineering approach. Metrics under seven different categories have been developed, weighted based on their relative relevance, and combined to yield a composite score. The methodology has been implemented in a spreadsheet tool plus a web application specifically aimed at assessing early-stage (TRL 1–3) concepts. The target use cases are (1) technology developers improving their design to find fatal flaws early, get feedback on current design, and identify areas of improvement that will yield the highest return on investment; (2) reviewers assessing technologies in competitions or making funding decisions; (3) investors or project developers doing due diligence; and (4) policymakers landscaping the technology domain for formulating research and development strategy. The methodology is also being adapted for assessing wave energy converters servicing markets outside the continental grid—broadly categorized as Powering the Blue Economy (PBE) applications.

Samples from two locations (Khor El Ramla and Tushka East) from Lake Nasser were studied. Partial sequences of the COI gene (barcode) for 20 Nile Puffer Fish from Lake Nasser were successfully amplified and analyzed. The average of nucleotides composition percent of both locations samples was 25.88, 31.54, 24.53, and 18.05 for T, C, A, and G respectively. The base composition analysis of both locations samples of the COI sequence revealed that AT content (50.41%) was higher than GC (49.59%). The current results of the phylogenetic analysis of Lake Nasser samples indicate that there are three groups of Nile Pufferfish in Lake Nasser. Two of them are presented in the south and the last one in the north and south of the Lake. Conversely, the GenBank and Lake Nasser samples indicate that there are two haplotypes from Tetraodon lineatus of the two locations from Lake Nasser based on the partial sequence of the COI gene. The first haplotype includes different samples from the two studied locations (North and south Lake) and the second includes five samples from the North Lake. Finally, the present phylogenetic results for Nile Pufferfish in Lake Nasser (Tetraodon lineatus), together with other African freshwater groups, matched with the monophyletic origin of African freshwater Puffer fishes. As a conclusion, overall data collected from this study will be fundamental for the Lake Nasser fishery and the handling of the problems caused by Nile pufferfish.

With a high potential for low cost power generation in locations otherwise isolated from the grid, marine hydrokinetic turbines could serve to help meet this growing power demand. This paper presents a novel adaptive super-twisting sliding mode control strategy for permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) driven by ocean current turbines (OCT). To ensure robustness and mitigate chattering during maximum power point tracking (MPPT), an adaptive gain adjustment technique is proposed for super-twisting sliding mode control. This technique does not require knowledge of the upper bounds of uncertainties, such as external marine environment variability or unmodeled dynamics. More specifically, the adaptive gain rate can vary with a sliding variable when system states are approaching or on the sliding mode, which constitutes the novelty of this paper.

All require awareness, information, and achievable actions to contribute to moving towards healthy oceans, the base of a robust blue economy. Ocean Watch, a program run by Ocean Wise Conservation Association, was created to translate scientific understanding, combined with community and traditional knowledge, to empower local action for improved marine health. Clear improvements have been made in the Átl'k_a7tsem/Txwnéwu7ts/Howe Sound marine environment, which have been captured in an updated report following from the original 2017 publication. Information within the reports illustrates the connection of communities and the marine environment through articles describing seven themes, which are: (1) Species and Habitat; (2) Clean Water; (3) Sense of Place; (4) Coastal Development and Livelihoods; (5) Stewardship and Governance; (6) Oceanography and Climate Change; and (7) Seafood. Articles such as the 2017 article: ""Sea Stars: wasting disease taking its toll"" gave background, rationale for importance, current status, current actions, and recommended actions to improve the health status (healthy, caution, critical, limited/no data). The health status for 10 of 28 reassessed articles improved largely due to actions taken by local communities, as recommended in the 2017 report. However, more work is needed, especially for areas of marine health that were not improving and to address threats from climate change. Establishing a sustainable socio-ecological relationship with the ocean is necessary if we are to protect and restore the health of all components of the ecosystem. Empowering communities to take action improves ocean health, which is inherently linked to the health of individuals, communities, and economies. © 2020 by the authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3390/JMSE8100739,Blue economy;Marine biodiversity;Ocean pollution;Sustainable development goals (SDGs);British Columbia;Military Personnel;Canada,,,10.3390/JMSE8100739,DOI(,10.3390/JMSE8100739,DOI(10.3390/JMSE8100739) OR,,,,,

The management of coastal ecosystem services seeks to analyse the various service characteristics and potentials in relation to human activities in coastal zones which are major contributors to Blue Economies. Shellfish reefs provide many of these ecosystem services, but their efficient use and conservation depend on MSP strategies. Therefore, a conceptual framework was adapted and applied to allow an evidence-based decision making that protects and ensures a sustainable use of shellfish reefs. The Dutch Wadden Sea was selected as a case study that could benefit from the implementation of this theoretical framework. This application included an ecological modelling approach that enabled the exploration of future climate scenarios. Four shellfish-based management strategies were developed: Do nothing, Hold the line, Advance the line and Recolonization. These strategies were applied to the modelled climate scenarios and evaluated by their potential effects to the net flow of Ecosystem Services from shellfish reefs. A multi-criteria analysis identified the benefits that could be derived from actively preserving and maintaining shellfish reefs. Results indicate that the performance of different management choices varies under different scenarios, thus the selection of one or another must be well informed. Knowing the effects of different management strategies on the provision of ecosystem services creates awareness among stakeholders and can help policy makers in their decisions to efficiently manage the Dutch Wadden Sea from a conservation perspective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104058,Climate change;Ecological modelling;Ecosystem services;Marine spatial planning (MSP);Reef management;Shellfish;Atlantic Ocean;Netherlands;North Sea;Wadden Sea;climate change;coastal zone management;conceptual framework;decision making;ecosystem service;multicriteria analysis;policy making;reef;shellfish;stakeholder,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104058,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104058,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104058) OR,,,,,

Sea farming development is considered an important aspect that needs to be promoted for the CBEG program. Generally, sea farming relies on artificial technologies, environmental improvement and resource management to increase fishery resources and to enhance fisheries productivity. Developing sea farming could contribute to the transformation of capture fisheries; it integrates the concept of Blue Economy into sustainable economic development so as to improve economic activities in fishing communities. In line with this, the Taiwan government launched the Community-Based Sea Farming (CBSF) project in 2015. The CBSF project aims to establish sea farming zones to help fishing communities achieve sustainable development. In this paper, the development process of sea farming and site selection of the CBSF project were described and the needs of local people in fishing communities around sea-farming demonstration zones were also assessed. According to findings, a framework for sea farming development is proposed. In this framework, several new sea farming-based industries can serve as the driving force to accelerate the development of fishing communities. The driving forces include developing a community-based tourism recreational industry, strengthening localized marketing of featured seafood products, combining local ecological landscapes and cultures of the fishing village to develop recreational fishery activities, and integrating seafood products with recreational tourism activities. Overall, CBSF are important tasks that warrant continuous attention for enhancing the fishing community development. The experiences and framework of promoting the Taiwan CBSF project would provide beneficial information and foundation for decision makers and natural resources managers in other areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105015,Co-management;Coastal blue economy growth program;Community-based sea farming project;Fishing communities;Marine stock enhancement;Sea farming;Taiwan;Decision making;Environmental technology;Fish products;Fisheries;Planning;Site selection;Sustainable development;Blue economies;Community development;Community-based;Environmental improvements;Recreational fisheries;Sustainable economic development;aquaculture production;economic development;fishing community;fishing industry;seafood;site selection;state role;stock enhancement;tourism development;village;Industrial economics,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105015,DOI(,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105015,DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105015) OR,,,,,

It is unclear whether this new concept requires a new set of governance principles and policies, or whether existing policy mechanisms can accommodate it. Using Timor Leste as a case study, we examine policy coherence and coordination across a range of maritime sectors. We do so through content analysis of formal instruments, such as legislation and policy documents, and semi-structured interviews with governance actors and organizations. We assess policy coherence by examining whether governance objectives are shared within and across existing sector-based policies, and the extent to which they are consistent with Blue Economy objectives. We explore policy coordination through network analysis of the connections between instruments as well as people. A number of gaps in the Timor Leste policy landscape are apparent, with weak governance around social objectives, particularly in the ports sector. In general, however, the existing governing system appears to be largely consistent with Blue Economy aspirations. In addition, there are existing, highly influential policy documents and organizations that are already playing a critical bridging role between sectors. Strengthening connections between sectoral management arrangements, through boundary organizations and amendments to existing instruments, may therefore be an efficient and pragmatic approach to Blue Economy implementation.

As the main hypothesis, we consider that there are three reasons that lead to the concern of cooperatives about the environment and, therefore, to the need of training in this issue, in coherence with the fifth cooperative principle. In this sense, firstly, we will address the impact that the exposure to certain means or environments can cause on the cooperative members and workers. It entails the need to study the ways in which the prevention is organized and managed in front of environmental risks in cooperatives, as well as to see the peculiarities of cooperatives in this regard. Secondly, we will study the impact of the cooperative work in the environment. Therefore, we will address the way in which that impact can be managed in cooperatives before the mandate derived from the seventh cooperative principle. Finally, we will delve into the importance of considering environment for the purpose of looking for new markets in the green and blue economy.

Often defined as a global policy agenda, blue economy discourses and practices aim to generate ‘blue growth’ by linking poverty reduction, social equality, and marine conservation. While global and national policies have spent decades addressing coastal resource management, broader blue economy discourses and practices seem, on the surface, to promote economic growth strategies for marine conservation. Increasingly, new market-oriented programs and projects aim to tap the financial value of the ocean’s ‘blue capital’, ostensibly fostering income generation and sustainable solutions for conservation finance. Drawing on critical discourse analysis and key-informant interviews across scales, we examine the meanings and practices of the blue economy in Southeast Asia and in the Philippines. As an archipelagic nation, millions of coastal dwellers in the Philippines depend on oceans as a major source of livelihood, food security, and well-being. We examine how multilateral institutions, bilateral organisations, state agencies, civil society organisations, and other key actors represent and enact the blue economy discursively and in practice. We find that oceans are being imagined as an open frontier that must be managed and utilised for both conservation and economic purposes. New territorialisation processes are creating new borders and management structures that often bypass social and environmental safeguards, posing a major threat to coastal dwellers.

While trade talks are still ongoing and President Trump has hinted at the possibility of an interim agreement, the prospects of an agreement between the two sides on a comprehensive US-China trade deal in the near-term remains uncertain. Several factors have placed Malaysia to be in a favorable position. One of these factors is that Malaysia continues to be an important geopolitical trading route. In addition to being considered an integral component to the production house of the global supply chain for finished products, Malaysia's economy is highly dependent on the movement of goods and global currency. Furthermore, Malaysia is also predominantly reliant on its trades with China. It is suggested that the trade protectionism in the U.S. has resulted into a slowdown of China's growth, whereby this has created a domino effect on the Malaysian economy. Moreover, the economic prospects of many countries have worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a shutdown of major operations around the world that has disrupted global supply chains. Countries have employed inward strategies to alleviate national security and domestic economies, at the expense of the globalization process. Although the first wave of the virus has passed and world economies have started to recover, the global economy trajectory is still deemed ambiguous. China, which is a major hub for manufacturing, was heavily affected, and struggles to increase its GDP from 6.1 percent since the end of 2019. Due to the uncertainty on future prospects, the seventh Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohammed, had established three frameworks that would guide Malaysian foreign policy. Firstly, Malaysia will remain an active participant in all international organizations and treaties that it is a member of. Secondly, Malaysia will communicate its influence towards any decision-making processes in platforms where it is not a member. Thirdly, Malaysia will align its aims to the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the blue economy. Should this be the way forward from 2020 onwards, or would new strategies need to be crafted? What are the contemporary indicators that Malaysia should consider? Finally, what would be the ultimate message that would be delivered when Malaysia positions itself for its increasing potential in the near future? These questions will help guide this study in its examination of the feasibility of change in Continuity, as a strategy for Malaysian foreign policy in the near future. © 2020.

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Improving marine resource management and governance requires marrying science and socio-economics, which is key to the development of the Blue Economy. For sustainable growth of the Blue Economy (Blue Growth) to occur, there needs to be robust scientific information on the marine environment, detailed knowledge of activities occurring within ocean space, and comprehensive understanding of environmental impacts. To ensure Blue Growth is sustainable into the future, information is also needed on how the marine environment, activities and impacts may change with time, and at relevant spatial scales. ATLAS, a transAtlantic assessment and deep-water ecosystem-based EU H2020 Project, has undertaken pioneering research to understand the environmental status of the North Atlantic deep sea, and the interaction between Blue Growth scenarios and the marine environment. ATLAS research into North Atlantic Ocean circulation, species and habitat connectivity shows that the North Atlantic is changing, which will impact Blue Growth. As marine industries move progressively offshore, ATLAS work on defining elements of Good Environmental Status for deep-water ecosystems will improve the understanding of Blue Growth interactions with the deep-sea. Potential trade-offs to maintain ecosystem services at a sea-basin scale have also been explored through a selection of 12 ATLAS case studies. ATLAS interactions with industry have highlighted opportunities and challenges for Blue Economy sectors, particularly in the context of marine spatial planning. Through interviews, questionnaires and workshops, ATLAS has discussed key scientific findings and Blue Growth scenarios with 10 major Blue Economy sectors and many supporting sectors. This work illustrates the complexities of Blue Growth in the North Atlantic, including spatial needs, synergies and conflicts, and data sharing opportunities. ATLAS-industry dialogue also highlights differences in Blue Economy sectoral expectations, and levels of understanding relating to new policy instruments. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.2112/SI95-162.1,Blue Economy;Blue Growth;marine spatial planning;North Atlantic;Atlantic Ocean;Atlantic Ocean (North);Florida [United States];United States;economic growth;environmental impact;governance approach;marine environment;marine resource;oceanic circulation;resource management;spatial planning,,,10.2112/SI95-162.1,DOI(,10.2112/SI95-162.1,DOI(10.2112/SI95-162.1) OR,,,,,

However, the country is constrained by several problems which affect the health of its coastal fish stocks. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is the most serious of these problems because it reduces fish stock levels. In this study, we analyze IUU fishing in Kuwaiti waters, and assess its impact on fish stock levels and consequent damage to the marine economy and environment, as well as its implications for the security system and the integrity of governance in the country. The research methods used in this study include key informant interviews, information obtained from some illegal fishers themselves, documentary data collected from Kuwaiti public authorities, and peer-reviewed literature. The main finding of the study is that IUU fishing in Kuwaiti waters not only threatens the health of the country's marine fish biomass but raises questions about Kuwait's immigration policy, the effectiveness of its border controls, and the way its decision-making processes are manipulated by groups who influence decision-making and large private companies which break fishing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,fisheries,Tier 1 (BE)",10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103775,Arabian Gulf;Blue economy;Fish stock decline;Fisheries;IUU fishing;Kuwaiti waters;Sustainable development;Kuwait [Middle East];decision making;fishery economics;fishery policy;fishery production;fishing;fishing community;regulatory framework;resource development;Kuwait,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103775,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103775,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103775) OR,,,,,

In the overall fisheries sector, the contribution of coastal fisheries, which is primarily generated by small-scale fishers (SSFs), has been continuously high. However, in recent years, it has started to decline. Changes occurring at local, national and global scales in the economic, political and policy spheres have impacted Sri Lankan SSFs differently, increasing their vulnerabilities. Drawing on a comprehensive review of the literature, this study examines the multiple vulnerabilities faced by SSFs in Sri Lanka, relating to four major themes: (1) Palk Bay geopolitics; (2) the war; (3) the tsunami and post-tsunami recovery; (4) post-war development and policy priorities. This paper builds a case for understanding these vulnerabilities and the way in which they continue, reemerge and threaten SSFs and their future livelihoods. It argues that, in the wake of new threats and opportunities created by post-war development, policy changes and geopolitical constraints, greater attention must be paid to SSFs. The paper concludes by summarising the discussion and recommending that SSFs should be meaningfully incorporated into the postwar development agenda and “blue economy” policy reforms. © 2020 National Science Foundation.

Here, we emphasize their major role in the co-design of tailored coastal climate services (CCS) based on a case study of French Polynesia. In this perspective, we assessed climate change perceptions by public authorities and identified their needs with regard to climate-related science. This assessment included an analysis of the decision-making context, semi-structured interviews with practitioners representing 23 administrative divisions directly or indirectly involved in climate change issues, and a workshop dedicated to discussing needs in terms of CCS. Generally, respondents did not identify climate change as a major current issue in French Polynesia; they showed more concern for economic growth, pollution, land tenure, and land use planning. However, interviewees were concerned about future impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean warming and acidification, mentioning in particular their detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems, shoreline position, economy (especially agriculture and the blue economy), and freshwater resources. The interviewed practitioners showed particular interest in SLR projections for future decades up to a century, and for knowledge on expected impacts to critical infrastructure, coastal systems, and natural resources. Practitioners’ needs made it possible to co-define four CCS to be developed: (1) the design of sea-level-rise-compatible critical infrastructures (airports and ports); (2) adapting to the risk of destabilization of beaches and reef islands; (3) professional training on climate change impacts and adaptation, including an analysis of potentially emerging new jobs in the SLR context; and (4) the development of participatory approaches for observing climate change impacts. While the co-development of these CCS will require a multi-year engagement of stakeholders concerned with climate change adaptation, our results already shed light on specific needs for salient CCS in highly vulnerable tropical island territories. © Copyright © 2020 Terorotua, Duvat, Maspataud and Ouriqua.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.3389/fmars.2020.00160,adaptation to climate change;climate change perception;climate governance;coastal climate services;French Polynesia,,,10.3389/fmars.2020.00160,DOI(,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to elaborate on the business sector's interest and involvement in MSP in the Baltic Sea region. The findings are based on the first-hand experiences of MSP authorities and experts. Furthermore, perspectives from two sea-use sectors, maritime transport and marine tourism, have been investigated using online questionnaires to discover their views. The study focuses on the questions of who to involve and what are the driving forces promoting business sector involvement. Even though MSP is a form of broad-scale planning, the results indicate that all spatial and organisational scales from local to international and from small enterprises to umbrella organisations should be considered when designing approach to business stakeholder participation. The planning authorities need to consider what are the benefits and challenges of involving different types of business stakeholders. Planners often rely on organisations that represent business stakeholders and individual companies. It is resource effective to interact with representatives as they are considered to have a wide and general knowledge of the respective sector's interests. However, in some cases it is beneficial to also integrate individual companies, especially in local or regional contexts. © 2020 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104301,Baltic Sea;Business representatives;Marine spatial planning;Planning process;Stakeholder involvement;Atlantic Ocean;business;economic growth;European Union;local participation;marine environment;maritime transportation;planning process;spatial planning;stakeholder;sustainable development,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104301,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104301,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104301) OR,,,,,

In this work, we use SST data from satellite images and in situ measurements collected by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to develop multifidelity forecasting models. This multifidelity framework is based on autoregressive Gaussian process schemes that systematically exploit all correlations between data from multiple heterogeneous spatiotemporal sources with various degrees of fidelity. This enables us to obtain implicitly their functional relationships and, at the same time, quantify the uncertainty of the data-driven predictions. Specifically, in the current work, we develop and validate progressively more complex models, including temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal multifidelity hindcast predictions of SST in the Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays.

It may emerge when economic activity is in balance with the long term capacity of ocean ecosystems to support the activity in a sustainable manner. Importantly, the concept of BE posits the inherent conflicts between two discourses—growth and development, and protection of ocean resources. The inherent conflicts require solutions to embrace the opportunities associated with the ocean economy while recognizing and addressing its threats. The potential solutions on a global scale are advocated by the United Nations in their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, we notice that the identification of the scope and boundaries of the BE in line with the UN's SDGs is vague even challenging, and the key stakeholders and their interests and roles in the BE are also vague. This review examines the scientific evidence of the association between the BE and the UN's SDGs, and relevance and alignment of stakeholders on the link between the BE and SDGs. Based on a literature survey between 1998 and 2018, we find that BE is highly associated with SDGs 14–17. Notably, we find that stakeholders prefer SDG 3 Good Health & Well-Being and SDG 8 Decent Work & Economic Growth in the BE context. As stakeholder involvement shows some differences and variations in the relationship between the BE and SDGs, we consider that stakeholders can play some roles directly or indirectly in the BE-SDGs context. In order to set achievable goals and targets in BE-SDGs, we support that key stakeholders should be identified to play several important roles in prosperous economic, societal development and setting tolerable ranges for the ocean biosphere. © 2020 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 108 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.envint.2020.105528,Blue Economy;Coastal Management;Marine Ecosystem Services;Marine Policy;Ocean Economy;Stakeholders;Economic Development;Ecosystem;Global Health;Sustainable Development;United Nations;Economics;Ecosystems;Environmental protection;Oceanography;Planning;Sustainable development;Water resources;Blue economies;Coastal management;Ecosystem services;Marine policy;coastal zone management;economic activity;ecosystem service;environmental economics;marine policy;stakeholder;sustainable development;Sustainable Development Goal;biosphere;marine environment;sea;short survey;stakeholder engagement;wellbeing;economic development;ecosystem;global health;Economic and social effects,,,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105528,DOI(,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105528,DOI(10.1016/j.envint.2020.105528) OR,,,,,

Within CARICOM however, there is the problematic existence of different understandings of what the blue economy represents. This is illustrated through the use of case studies of three CARICOM countries, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize and Grenada. Competing interpretations of the blue economy complicate global engagement and lead to a re-emergence of issues which the Caribbean Community have never fully confronted and resolved. It is found that CARICOM needs to facilitate discussion, understanding and compromise among its members to arrive at an agreed policy and strategy that would effectively co-ordinate and operationalize blue economy development in the region.

To illustrate this, we present three case studies of blue economy practices initiated and implemented by coastal communities in China, Samoa, and Vietnam. The outcomes from each case study are examined based on both their environmental and socio-economic impact. Lessons learned include the significant role of science and technology in innovating solutions, the crucial impact of community leaders in encouraging and amplifying both local needs and solutions, continuous advocacy, fulfilling the very important need for communities to witness tangible benefits of project implementation, and last but not least the availability of resources and know-how resulting from multi-stakeholder partnerships including local governing councils, NGOs, and community members.

Our paper aims at assessing the value of ecosystem services provided by mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and kelp forests present in the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of Africa. After the mapping of coastal marine habitats, our valuation relies on the transfer of value of all ecosystem services from reference monetary unit values, extracted from the literature. A habitat functionality index based on the assumption that a higher population density and a higher demographic growth rate lead to a decrease in the functionality and services of marine habitats was then defined and incorporated into the valuation. The surveyed coastal habitats cover about 117,000 km2, with seagrass beds being by far the most extensive habitat. Present all along the coasts of Africa, their surface area represents about 62% of surveyed coastal habitats, followed by the mangroves (23%), coral reefs (15%). Kelp forests are only present in the southern Benguela Current LME. We estimated the annual value of the LME's coastal ecosystem services at 814 billion USD. Coral reefs have the highest value (588 billion USD/year), followed by seagrass beds (135 billion USD/year), mangroves (91 billion USD/year), and kelp forests (0.4 billion USD/year). The results show that ecosystem services from the four coastal habitat types had the highest value in the Agulhas Current LME, representing 38% of the total value, followed by the Red Sea LME (28%) and the Somali Coastal Current LME (10%). The three LMEs of the Atlantic side represent 15% of the total estimated value. Our paper highlighted many gaps that remain to be filled in terms of mapping and ecosystem services assessment in Africa. Nonetheless, our estimated values can facilitate dialogue between decision-makers and managers, and between countries sharing the same habitats and marine resources, toward better management of these ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100584,Blue economy;Coastal marine habitats;Habitat functionality;Large marine ecosystems;Nature's contributions to people;Military Personnel;Africa,,,10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100584,DOI(,10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100584,DOI(10.1016/j.envdev.2020.100584) OR,,,,,

This chapter is structured in four main sections and takes a macroeconomics perspective to explore the contribution of algae and seaweeds to sustainable economic growth. In the first section, the concepts and definitions of bioeconomy, blue economy, and circular economy are introduced. These concepts particularly fit the context in which algae and seaweed products are developed, as they are sustainably sourced and they enter varied industrial processes as intermediate inputs or by-products. The second section presents the complex portfolio of current and future applications of algae and seaweeds across and between main industrial sectors. The majority of the current products obtained from algae and seaweeds consist of high-value compounds for food, feed, pharmaceuticals, and cosmeceuticals, but innovative applications for biofuels, biofertilizers, and green chemicals are rapidly evolving. The third section discusses the supply chain characteristics, the vertical integration, and the market context in which producers of algae biomass and products operate. The fourth section presents macroeconomic data and indicators of production, trade, and comparative advantage of algae products and biomass. The availability of public data is quite limited. The EU is currently the main provider of data due to its bioeconomy strategy, R&D investments, and comparative advantage in producing algae and seaweed products. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the current technological and policy challenges to foster the role of algae in the bioeconomy, and highlights the need for more accurate data for thorough economic analyses and policy evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Two experimental formulations were obtained using discarded endive (Cichorium endivia) leaves and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) industry discards in different proportions, and agar as a binder. The evaluation of the feed stability showed that the feed was stable for 72 hr, allowing a suitable feeding for sea urchins. Both formulations showed a proper nutritional value and fatty acid profile, corresponding to the features of the main ingredients and resulting suitable for echinoculture. A bioenergetic trial was carried out to measure daily ingestion rate, absorption efficiency and gonado-somatic index in sea urchins. They resulted also palatable and well absorbed by sea urchins, especially that one with higher fish content. At the end of the experiment, an increase in gonado-somatic index was also recorded. Despite further analysis is needed to assess the performance of the feed in terms of gonad yield and quality, these encouraging results indicate that food industry discards may be suitable alternative ingredients for the production of sustainable feeds for sea urchin aquaculture. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1111/anu.13063,aquaculture;blue economy;echinoculture;fatty acids;feedstuff;sustainability,,,10.1111/anu.13063,DOI(,10.1111/anu.13063,DOI(10.1111/anu.13063) OR,,,,,

Advances in the research are progressively uncovering the presence of unknown microorganisms, which have evolved unique metabolic and genetic pathways for the production of uncommon secondary metabolites. Fungi have a leading role in marine bioprospecting since they represent a prolific source of structurally diverse bioactive metabolites. Several bioactive compounds from marine fungi have already been characterized including antibiotics, anticancer, antioxidants and antivirals. Nowadays, the search for natural antioxidant molecules capable of replacing those synthetic currently used, is an aspect that is receiving significant attention. Antioxidants can inactivate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, preventing the insurgence of several degenerative diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, they also find applications in different fields, including food preservation, healthcare and cosmetics. This review focuses on the production of antioxidants from marine fungi.

The United Nations (UN) declared 2021–2030 as the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The Roadmap for the Ocean Decade aims to achieve six critical societal outcomes (SOs) by 2030, through the pursuit of four objectives (Os). It specifically recognizes the scarcity of biological data for deep-sea biomes, and challenges the global scientific community to conduct research to advance understanding of deep-sea ecosystems to inform sustainable management. In this paper, we map four key scientific questions identified by the academic community to the Ocean Decade SOs: (i) What is the diversity of life in the deep ocean? (ii) How are populations and habitats connected? (iii) What is the role of living organisms in ecosystem function and service provision? and (iv) How do species, communities, and ecosystems respond to disturbance? We then consider the design of a global-scale program to address these questions by reviewing key drivers of ecological pattern and process. We recommend using the following criteria to stratify a global survey design: biogeographic region, depth, horizontal distance, substrate type, high and low climate hazard, fished/unfished, near/far from sources of pollution, licensed/protected from industry activities. We consider both spatial and temporal surveys, and emphasize new biological data collection that prioritizes southern and polar latitudes, deeper (> 2000 m) depths, and midwater environments. We provide guidance on observational, experimental, and monitoring needs for different benthic and pelagic ecosystems. We then review recent efforts to standardize biological data and specimen collection and archiving, making “sampling design to knowledge application” recommendations in the context of a new global program. We also review and comment on needs, and recommend actions, to develop capacity in deep-sea research; and the role of inclusivity - from accessing indigenous and local knowledge to the sharing of technologies - as part of such a global program.

Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems promise large-scale production of macroalgae due to their high productivity and environmental sustainability. Complex host–microbiome interactions play a decisive role in macroalgal development, especially in Ulva spp. due to algal growth- and morphogenesis-promoting factors released by associated bacteria. However, our current understanding of the microbial community assembly and structure in cultivated macroalgae is scant. We aimed to determine (i) to what extent IMTA settings influence the microbiome associated with U. rigida and its rearing water, (ii) to explore the dynamics of beneficial microbes to algal growth and development under IMTA settings, and (iii) to improve current knowledge of host–microbiome interactions. We examined the diversity and taxonomic composition of the prokaryotic communities associated with wild versus IMTA-grown Ulva rigida and surrounding seawater by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. With 3141 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), the prokaryotic richness was, overall, higher in water than in association with U. rigida. Bacterial ASVs were more abundant in aquaculture water samples than water collected from the lagoon. The beta diversity analysis revealed distinct prokaryotic communities associated with Ulva collected in both aquacultures and coastal waters. Aquaculture samples (water and algae) shared 22% of ASVs, whereas natural, coastal lagoon samples only 9%. While cultivated Ulva selected 239 (8%) host-specific ASVs, wild specimens possessed more than twice host-specific ASVs (17%). Cultivated U. rigida specimens enriched the phyla Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria. Within the Gammaproteobacteria, while Glaciecola mostly dominated the microbiome in cultivated algae, the genus Granulosicoccus characterized both Ulva microbiomes. In both wild and IMTA settings, the phylum Bacteroidetes was more abundant in the bacterioplankton than in direct association with U. rigida. However, we observed that the Saprospiraceae family within this phylum was barely present in lagoon water but very abundant in aquaculture water. Aquaculture promoted the presence of known morphogenesis-inducing bacteria in water samples. Our study suggests that IMTA significantly shaped the structure and composition of the microbial community of the rearing water and cultivated U. rigida.

The CE is framed as a transformative model with economic, environmental and social benefits. Nevertheless, the degree of circularity in the global economy is low and critics highlight that current interpretations fall short in delivering promised results regarding the social dimension of sustainability. Instead economic growth is elevated above more radical socio-environmental transformation. This exploratory paper adopts a human needs approach, using Max-Neef's Human-Scale Development proposal as an analytical lens to explore the contentious social dimension of the CE. The study revisits four seminal texts which are commonly referenced as influencing the CE's conceptual development: The Blue Economy; Cradle to Cradle; Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development; and, The Performance Economy. These texts were analysed to identify satisfiers of human needs.

We argue that satisfiers of human needs are embedded, to differing extents, in some of the early CE depictions.

What type of knowledge and skills are required in today’s digital world to develop professionally and succeed as an entrepreneur? What are the major barriers to successful entrepreneurship preventing women from realizing their full potential or stopping them from even beginning an entrepreneurial career? A current literature review (2011–2019) on women’s entrepreneurial initiatives, skills, characteristics, attributes, motives and leadership styles, documenting strategies for success and barriers confronted, indicates that not much has changed. Women entrepreneurs continue to face the multitasking whirlpool, along with the lack of financial resources, marketing skills and support services, including poor access to business networks, technology and digital markets. Despite the mass entry of women in exclusively male domains, glass ceilings have not been shattered. Then again, developed and developing nations have come to understand that women’s entrepreneurial activities contribute to socioeconomic growth and utilizing the full potential of all human resources is essential for sustainable development. Studies of the 21st century—as those of the late 20th century —continue to spotlight gender gaps in entrepreneurship as well as the so-valued career–family balance, while still arguing that further research is needed. They also agree that successful entrepreneurship requires digital skills along with the drive for innovation. The successful entrepreneur, or to use a term and concept coined by Elias G. Carayannis and McDonald R. Stewart (2013), the “distinguished entrepreneur” regardless of gender, is an innovator; a visionary; a person who predicts and shapes the future; takes initiatives; accepts change, risk and failure; learns from it; and sees what others do not see, among other things. Accordingly, this study presents snapshots of lives changed and empowered. It includes the work and narratives of “distinguished” (Carayannis & Stewart 2013) women entrepreneurs who have made a difference.

This is represented in the cyber-physical context, in which humans and technologies are allowed to coexist and learn from each other. Design/methodology/approach: The logistics and supply chain sector consists of numerous partners and stakeholders, and despite the limited inclusion of automation and AI within the sector, there are still many manual and repetitive tasks. Findings: Stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain sector are creating awareness and slowly implementing AI and automation within their operations. The majority of shipping and logistics is done through the maritime sector, and this is expected to increase in line with the world’s population. Research limitations/implications: Research was limited to Jamaica and a few other countries in the Caribbean. Broadening the scope to include other regional shipping and logistics industry stakeholders would be helpful. Practical implications: The removal of sometimes mundane and even more complex manual processes in the logistics supply chain will give rise to more efficiencies and possibly increased revenue. Social implications: Creating awareness in the Caribbean of international trends is a challenge. Empowering people to use automation and AI for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change and other disasters is yet to be fully realized. However, those who took part in the study did show a significant inclination toward the use of automation and AI in their every-day lives.

As many such initiatives are in the global South, labour’s marginality potentially contributes to the existing precariousness of those who are more often identified as “participants”. This article examines the roles and vulnerabilities of these actors: the carbon counters, species identifiers, GIS mappers, tree planters and others operating in the shadows. We draw on current understandings of labour and precarity to examine the geographical contours of an apparent and emerging “eco-precariat”: a socio-economically diverse group of labourers that address the volatile demands of an ever-expanding environmental service-based economy. We illustrate our analysis drawing on examples from a Blue Carbon project in Kenya, ecosystem services project in the Philippines, and REDD+ scheme in Cambodia. We use these examples to theorise the nature of labour in these frontier economies and put forward a framework for analysing the eco-precariat. We highlight the need to understand the precarity and marginalisation potentially created by this green division of labour in the provision of new ecosystem products and services. This framework contributes to ongoing analyses of labour as a central part of the green economy discourse and to larger discussions in the geographies of labour literature around the future of work in the global South and beyond. © 2020 The Authors.

Progress towards the sustainable development of the deep sea requires useful indicators that point to changes in human well-being as the deep sea is exploited, such as measures of inclusive wealth. Accounting prices for the natural capital of the deep sea would be useful indicators, and several examples are explored to illustrate current understanding and research gaps. A future economic research agenda would involve refining estimates of accounting prices for the most important types of deep-sea natural capital, locating these within linked classifications of ecosystem services and natural capital, and the design and implementation of a system of economic and environmental accounts for the deep sea comprising the high seas, which lies beyond the purview of individual states. © Oxford University Press.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1093/oso/9780198841654.003.0002,Accounting price;BBNJ;Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction;Deep sea;Economic;Ecosystem service;High seas;Natural capital;Sustainable development;Valuation,,,10.1093/oso/9780198841654.003.0002,DOI(,10.1093/oso/9780198841654.003.0002,DOI(10.1093/oso/9780198841654.003.0002) OR,,,,,

Although restoration strategies such as assisted evolution have recently been proposed to enhance the performance of coral reef populations in response to current and future stressors, scalability of these concepts and implementation in habitat or ecosystem-wide management remains a major limitation for logistical and financial reasons. We propose to implement these restoration efforts into an ecotourism approach that embeds land-based coral gardening efforts as architectural landscape elements to enhance and beautify coastal development sites, providing additional value and rationale for ecotourism stakeholders to invest. Our approach extends and complements existing concepts integrating coral reef restoration in ecotourism projects by creating a participatory platform that can be experienced by the public, while effectively integrating numerous restoration techniques, and providing opportunities for long-term restoration and monitoring studies. In this context, we discuss options for pre-selection of corals and systematic, large-scale monitoring of coral genotype performance targeting higher resilience to future stressors. To reduce operating costs during out-planting, we suggest to create coral seeding hubs, clusters of closely transplanted conspecifics, to quickly and efficiently restore/enhance active reproduction. We discuss our land-based coral gardening approach in the context of positive impacts beyond reef restoration. By restoring and strengthening resilience of local populations, we believe this strategy will contribute to a net positive conservation impact, create a culture on restoration and enhance and secure blue economical investments that rely on healthy marine systems. © Copyright © 2020 Schmidt-Roach, Duarte, Hauser and Aranda.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Others,positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3389/fmars.2020.00672,adaptive coral gardening;blue economy;coral restoration;coral seeding hubs;ecotourism,,,10.3389/fmars.2020.00672,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2020.00672,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.00672) OR,,,,,

In 2015, the UN impulsed an ambitious initiative called the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including 17 Goals and 169 Targets, to be accomplished in the 2015-2030 period. At the same time, offshore wind industry has taken the great leap towards the ocean. Such wind farms hold more and more wind turbines (>100), depths increase leaving shallow waters (almost 100 m deep), and the power installed is increasing at a dramatic rate not thought to be possible only one decade ago (currently reaching 400 MW). These facts are ones of the great advances of the XXI century, but so far, it has not been done a deep reflection on the impact of the offshore wind on the aforementioned SDG, and on how the offshore wind is going to accomplish all the challenges happening when trying to reach such SDG. The achievement of some of the SDG and the offshore wind technology progress go, with no doubt, hand in hand. This is the case of Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (Climate action), or Goal 14 (Life below water). But there are also other SDG that deserve a special attention, in order to ensure that offshore wind power technology effectively will contribute to reach them, and will not, on the contrary, act to the detriment of them. This is the case of Goal 7 (Affordable and clean energy), Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth), or Goal 10 (Reducing inequalities). In this paper, the great contribution of the offshore wind technology to achieve the SDG is commented, making special emphasis on the possible weaknesses that could appear, and on how to solve them.

However, in Africa, much of the emphasis on BE is placed on economic gains; as a result, traditional livelihoods and small-scale local operations are outcompeted by international corporations and government initiatives, with little or no regard for social inclusion and environmental sustainability. We argue that successful BE initiatives in Africa accentuate the involvement of local communities and promote sustenance of the natural ecosystem. We define success in terms of the sustainability balance among ecological, social and economic aspects. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, observational data and literature review of case studies across the African continent, we highlight two critical findings. First, large scale BE initiatives prioritize economic gains at the expense of environmental degradation and the exclusion of local communities. Second, using the full spectrum sustainability (FSS) evaluation, we show that successful BE interventions considered ecological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional objectives. Drawing on these case studies, we propose the adoption of a collaborative framework which amalgamates the top-down and bottom-up approaches to BE management. Achieving the goal of successful blue growth in Africa is now even more challenged by the implications of COVID-19 on the BE sectors.

This paper builds a narrative from an ocean perspective – through the lens of a coral reef seascape, and the blue economy. The ocean, intimately connected with the land, freshwater flows and climate provides a vast array of benefits to humanity. These benefits are valued at trillions of dollars per year globally, supporting hundreds of millions of jobs, and contributing to all countries both coastal and inland, through living and non-living resources, transport infrastructure and natural products, and sustainable energy solutions; the coastal zone is home to half the world's population. Through these direct benefits, the ocean contributes to reduced hunger and poverty, improved health, and all these benefits may be shared across gender, social and national boundaries. However accessing ocean benefits results in pressures that may drive decline in ocean health. Managing this complex system for a sustainable blue economy requires developing and using the right knowledge, new governance mechanisms and investment by stakeholders from global to local levels. This ‘blue economy’ narrative builds on the links between ocean health (SDG14) and economy (SDG8), but the general model can be expressed from the perspective of any goal(s) towards the others. The model also applies across scales from local to global, the relationships defined in the model enabling monitoring and assessment.

Laminarialean kelps are widely harvested along the Warm Temperate South-eastern Pacific coast, a marine province shared by Chile and Peru. Carbon storage assessments of kelps in Peru are lacking. From a blue economy and sustainable management perspectives, information on the carbon storage of kelps is important. We conduct the first carbon storage assessment of Lessonia trabeculata in Peru and contribute to the development of biomass estimation models in order to monitor kelps using the least destructive methodologies. We chose three commonly harvested sites in San Juan de Marcona to haphazardly extract Lessonia trabeculata sporophytes using transects. Sporophyte height (m), wet biomass (kg), maximum (D) and minimum (d) holdfast disk widths (cm) were measured in the field. In the laboratory, C content was measured to calculate the best-fitting coefficients for future estimations by using allometric equations. Individual biomass was best estimated from sporophyte height through a rational model, while holdfast area (ellipse in cm2) was a good proxy of biomass with a sinusoidal model. The southernmost, least accessible, and most exposed site (Elefante) had significantly higher values of stored carbon.

In general, islands are highly dependent on energy imports which, in turn, feature a marked seasonal demand. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in these regions can therefore fulfill a twofold objective: (i) to increase the renewable energy share for global decarbonization and (ii) to reduce the external energy dependence for isolated (or interconnected) systems in which this can only be achieved with an increase of the renewable energy share. However, the increase in renewable technologies makes energy generation more dependent on future climate and its variability. The main aim of this study is to analyze future projections of wind and photovoltaic potential, as well as energy productivity droughts, on the main Euro-Mediterranean islands. Due to the limitations in land surface available in the islands for the installation of renewable energy capacity, the analysis is extended to offshore wind and photovoltaic energy, which may have an important role in the future increases of renewable energy share. To that end, we use climate variables from a series of simulations derived from Euro-CORDEX (Coordinated Downscaling Experiment) simulations for the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. A special effort is performed to normalize projected changes and the associated uncertainties. The obtained normalized changes make it easier the intercomparison between the results obtained in the different islands and constitute condensed and valuable information that aims to facilitate climate-related policy decision making for decarbonization and Blue Growth in the islands. © 2020 by the authors.

The blue economy has become synonymous with generating wealth from ocean-related activities while protecting and supporting marine ecosystems. For remote coastal communities and Small Island Developing States, local economic development is a challenging balance between protecting marine biodiversity and maintaining sustainable and direct access to ecosystem services. In this paper, we present results of a study in the coastal region of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia in the Coral Triangle. The paper illustrates that community-based ecotourism supports sustainable use of marine resources and offers an entry point for low-resource coastal communities to take part in the blue economy. Complementary livelihood pathways that enhance primary income and support ecosystem services play a key role. Study findings show that three key areas where multilateral support is most needed for communities with ecotourism aspirations are: waste management, hospitality skills, and market access. From these findings, we present a model for community-based ecotourism in the blue economy. The model demonstrates important interactions between community, the local economy, and coastal ecosystems, and the important role community-based ecotourism plays in creating effective mechanisms for preserving natural and cultural heritage. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: tourism,positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1080/09669582.2020.1747475,blue economy;coastal tourism;community-based ecotourism;ecosystem services;sustainable livelihoods;Coral Triangle;Pacific Ocean;Anthozoa;cultural heritage;ecosystem service;ecotourism;sustainability;sustainable development;tourism development;tourism market;Ecosystem,,,10.1080/09669582.2020.1747475,DOI(,10.1080/09669582.2020.1747475,DOI(10.1080/09669582.2020.1747475) OR,,,,,

Poorly planned and regulated tourism activities on land and sea have led to degradation of environmentally sensitive marine areas, encroachment on public beaches, erosion of the shoreline and blockage of public access points to the beaches. These impacts transcend the land and ocean continuum necessitating the need for regulation. Spatial planning is one of the key tools that provides a pre-emptive strategic framework for regulating tourism uses so as to prevent harmful development and mitigate the impact of potentially polluting activities. However, spatial planning as applied in Kenya has focused on the regulation of physical developments on land such as the construction of hotels but not on the related tourism activities that emanate from such developments. In this case, activities that tourists engage in outside of the physical hotel structure such as swimming, leisure walks, sport fishing, souvenir collection, and snorkeling are not the subject of spatial planning leading to unsustainable use within the coastal zone. This study makes a case for adopting an integrated spatial planning approach as a lever for regulating tourism activities within this expanded lens, beyond just the buildings and activities that take place within the hotel establishments. The spatial planning approach would include a holistic regulation of coastal tourism activities within both terrestrial and marine spaces in order to attain sustainable management of the marine ecosystem. © 2020–Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,tourism,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.4314/wiojms.v19i1.6,Blue Economy;Coastal Zone;Kenya;Malindi;Pollution;Spatial Planning;Tourism,,,10.4314/wiojms.v19i1.6,DOI(,10.4314/wiojms.v19i1.6,DOI(10.4314/wiojms.v19i1.6) OR,,,,,

Human pressures from runoff, atmospheric emissions, marine pollution, fishing, shipping, military operations and other activities wear on habitats and populations. Ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP) has emerged worldwide as a strategic instrument for handling conflicting spatial claims among competing sectors and the environment. The twofold objective of both boosting the blue economy and protecting the environment is challenging in practice and marine planners need decision support. Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) was originally developed to provide an overview of the human imprint on the world's ocean ecosystems. We have now added a scenario component to the CIA model and used it within Swedish ecosystem-based MSP. This has allowed us to project environmental impacts for different planning alternatives throughout the planning process, strengthening the integration of environmental considerations into strategic decision-making. Every MSP decision may entail a local shift of environmental impact, causing positive or negative consequences for ecosystem components. The results from Swedish MSP in the North Sea and Baltic Sea illustrate that MSP certainly has the potential to lower net cumulative environmental impact, both locally and across sea basins, as long as environmental values are rated high and prevailing pressures derive from activities that are part of MSP. By synthesizing innumerous data into comprehensible decision support that informs marine planners of the likely environmental consequences of different options, CIA enables ecosystem-based MSP in practice. © 2018 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139024,Cumulative impact assessment;Decision support tool;Ecosystem-based management;Marine spatial planning;Multiple pressures;Symphony-tool;Atlantic Ocean;Baltic Sea;North Sea;Sweden;Decision making;Decision support systems;Marine pollution;Military operations;Planning;Atmospheric emission;Ecosystem components;Environmental consequences;Environmental considerations;Environmental values;Marine Spatial Planning;Strategic decision making;decision making;ecosystem management;environmental impact assessment;planning process;spatial planning;article;decision support system;economic aspect;ecosystem;environmental impact;human;sea;Ecosystems;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139024,DOI(,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139024,DOI(10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139024) OR,,,,,

These expectations can come in the form of predictions, projections, scenarios, narratives, visions and intuitions, at different spatial and temporal scales. While each can provide different insights into a system future, it is not clear how they can be effectively combined into a unified analysis. Here, we propose a general framework to combine conceptual models, numerical projections and scenario narratives, leading to a system view of the functioning of the future Blue Economy sectors as applied to Australian oceans. We start by developing a conceptual model of the sectors directly or indirectly interacting with the Australian oceans and their national and global drivers. We then identify scenarios and projections for each global driver as well as projections of future development for the national drivers and for the Blue Economy sectors. Comparisons of the global scenarios, national projections and sectoral projections suggest that the Australian marine sectors expect to follow a path of growth mostly driven by market forces enabled by government regulations. The analysis of each sector provides information on the extent to which the initial conceptual model can be improved as part of more detailed analysis at a sectoral level. This approach supports sector-based marine planning with a consistent and repeatable framing and can help researchers, managers and stakeholders reach a shared understanding of system interactions and the potential impact of future shocks to national and international drivers. © Copyright © 2020 Boschetti, Bulman, Hobday, Fulton, Contardo, Lozano-Montes, Robinson, Smith, Strzelecki and Ingrid van Putten.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 5 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2020.563205,blue economy;future studies;global change;global scenarios;marine resources;Military Personnel,,,10.3389/fmars.2020.563205,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2020.563205,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2020.563205) OR,,,,,

However, data and information of mangrove vegetation and its ecosystem services particularly carbon stocks were limited. Mangroves were mapped using GIS-remote sensing and vegetation were sampled using transects in five sites of mangroves across Weda Bay. Tansects were extended from seaward to landward to cover all vegetation variation and hydrodynamic conditions. Environmental data (water and substrate): temperature, pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), particle size of sediment, and nutrient (phosphate and nitrate) were collected. The objective is to identify characteristics of mangrove landscape and vegetation, it is environment, and it ecosystem services in term of aboveground carbon stocks. The study showed that the characteristics of landscape and vegetation of mangrove varied among hydrodynamic conditions. The bay is important habitat for 8.5% (17 species) of mangrove species in Indonesia. Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza were the most dominant mangroves. The environmental conditions of Weda Bay particularly northern part of the bay were suitable for mangrove growth. Substrate of mangrove did not vary significantly with distance from the seaward which was mainly dominated by mud and clay (3.9 - 63 μm). Mean water temperature in the mangrove area was 29.3°C, salinity 34.1 psu, mean water suspension was 46 mg l-1, mean dissolved oxygen was 3.2 mg l-1, and water current was 10 m s-1. Aboveground carbon stock was considerable (752 ± 17.6 Mg C ha-1). Change in aboveground carbon stocks over the distance from the seaward edge to landward edge was not significantly different. In contrast, aboveground carbon stocks varied among hydrodynamic conditions: estuarine, delta, and riverine mangroves. Delta mangrove contained the highest carbon stock (993 ± 27.7 Mg C ha-1), followed by estuarine mangroves (645 ± 12.2 Mg C ha-1) and riverine mangroves (244 ± 8.6 Mg C ha-1). However, this ecosystem faced some threats such as mangrove extraction and plastic pollution. Better mangrove management e.g. reducing mangrove extraction and pollution are required to protect the functions and ecosystem services of mangroves. In addition, conserving mangrove forests will allow the government to achieve blue economy goals and to mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1088/1755-1315/618/1/012021,aboveground carbon;landscape;Mangrove;spatial metrics;vegetation;Weda Bay;Biochemical oxygen demand;Biodiversity;Carbon;Climate change;Dissolved oxygen;Ecosystems;Extraction;Hydrodynamics;Magnesium;Particle size;Planning;Remote sensing;River pollution;Sustainable development;Vegetation;Above-ground carbons;Bruguiera Gymnorrhiza;Carbon sequestration;Data and information;Environmental conditions;Environmental data;Hydrodynamic conditions;Mangrove ecosystems;Forestry;Vegetables,,,10.1088/1755-1315/618/1/012021,DOI(,,,,,,,

Despite its remarkable achievements, China's coordinated regional development still faces problems such as unbalanced economic growth between the southern and northern China, great gaps in innovation capacity among regions, difficulties in ensuring equitable access to basic public services, and slow growth of Blue Economy. To pursue regional development in China, the most important task at present is to promote coordinated and high-quality regional development and create a new pattern that can help such development become better in terms of quality, efficiency, fairness, and sustainability. The shift from questing for coordinated regional development to high-quality coordinated regional development not only reflects the transformation of regional development concept but also adapts to the requirement for regional development transformation in today's China. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, to promote high-quality coordinated regional development, China should continue to make overall planning for the four major regions and coordinate the development of belts and zones with the four major regions as the basis and the key belts and zones as the framework. It should continue to deepen and improve the ""4+X""master strategy for regional development and facilitate the formation of a national system for regional development strategies. It should further improve the governance system for China's national space, with an emphasis on creating the main framework for the development of national space that consists of three horizontal axes and three vertical axes, stretches over the eastern, central and western regions, and connects the northern region with the southern region, setting up a network of growth poles mainly supported by city clusters and metropolitan areas, and putting in place a negative list system for national space development.

Advancements in science and technology have significantly altered how humans interact with and access the ocean, allowing exploration and exploitation of ocean areas and processes that were previously incomprehensible. This new capacity to understand and extract from the ocean might be expected to profoundly alter human relationships to it and conceptions of it.

The White Sea coastal municipal areas enter different subjects of the North-West Federal District of Russia and belong to the Russian Arctic zone. The subject of the study is socio-economic processes taking place in the White Sea coastal municipalities. The aim of this work is to identify trends in socio-ecological and economic development of the White Sea coastal municipal areas in the context of blue growth and to elaborate recommendations for the formation an inclusive management system for their development. The statistical data published by the Federal State Statistic Service (Rosstat) and reflecting the development of municipalities in the three interrelated areas of sustainable development are analyzed. The destructive tendencies occurring in the social, economic and environmental sphere of coastal territories are reveled and described: Depopulation, decrease in economic activity, and environmental load. Models are developed that reflect migration processes taking place in coastal municipal formations within the period 1989—2017. The economic development of coastal municipal formations is associated with the availability and accessibility of natural resources. In some municipal districts, the main types of economic activity are those related to the livelihoods of the population. There is a decrease in quality of economic space due to a reduction in the number of working-age people. The digital space of coastal settlements is forming slowly. Against the background of destructive processes in economic sphere, the eco-intensity of emissions decreases. The authors propose recommendations on shaping of a regular institutional environment and overcoming depopulation processes, and suggest directions for the economy diversification of coastal territories. The authors consider it necessary to strengthen inter-municipal cooperation and coordination of management decisions for achieving sustainable development goals in the White Sea region. The realization of the long-term potential of the blue economy in the sphere of employment, economic activity and environmental responsibility is possible if socio-ecological and economic aspects of managing the White Sea region are coordinated and the authorities at all government levels work systematically along the direction. © Kurilo A.

However, unlocking its full potential is unlikely to occur through sole focus on increasing production. Using a framework for identifying the “people-policy gap” in aquaculture as a starting point, we introduce benefit sharing as a necessary and complementary concept to filling this gap, as well as the notion of policy coherence to achieve equitable aquaculture development. We examine these concepts in the context of mariculture development through an analysis of national mariculture policies and plans from a selection of Western Indian Ocean (WIO) countries. Our analysis shows that whilst important building blocks and a common thrust for equitable mariculture development exist at regional level, mechanisms through which the benefits from mariculture development are to reach stakeholders affected directly and indirectly by mariculture operations at national levels are not adequately considered. Lack of policy coherence at national level not only prevents progress towards closing the “people-policy gap” in mariculture development, but it may also jeopardise how the sector can live up to its expectations in the region. On the basis of these considerations, we extend our reflection to the aquaculture sector as a whole and argue that policy coherence and benefit sharing should become key considerations in the planning and future development of sustainable and equitable aquaculture. © 2020","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,aquaculture",10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104271,Aquaculture;Benefit sharing;Blue economy;Equity;Mariculture;Policy coherence;Western Indian Ocean;Indian Ocean;equity;fishery management;fishery policy;mariculture;policy development;resource development;stakeholder,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104271,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104271,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104271) OR,,,,,

Without effective CBTT, many developing countries are unlikely to be able to fulfill their obligations in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), including by undertaking area-based management, evaluating environmental impact assessments, and benefiting from the utilization of marine genetic resources – or to realize their rights. Meanwhile, several other international commitments require varying forms of CBTT at global, regional and national levels. This article analyses areas where synergies are possible for implementing CBTT, and those where additional, ABNJ-related capacities will need to be mainstreamed for holistic ocean management. We argue that CBTT is more meaningful, effective and resource-efficient if it corresponds to the ecological realities of an interconnected ocean by linking initiatives relating to ABNJ with those within national jurisdiction. We discuss why and how CBTT is also more useful on the national level if it maximizes synergies between international policies and agreements, and allows countries to concurrently participate in a BBNJ agreement and fulfill national priorities related to sustainable development, for example by enhancing livelihoods, eradicating hunger and poverty, and building capacity for science and innovation as part of national blue economies based on healthy ocean ecosystems.

Yet in countries like India, where the government is not yet promoting MSP, ocean space has already been divided using principles and practices that are characteristic of MSP elsewhere in the world. Instead of being initiated by the state, these MSP-like processes are initiated by international agencies when industries seek large-scale development of India’s marine ecosystems. Although intended as an inclusive, holistic process to plan industrial development, this assemblage of MSP technologies, processes, and practices mandated by international corporations produces a particular power relation through its rejection of local knowledge and insistence on data, for instance, in the form of discrete, geo-coded polygons. This paper argues that this form of MSP produces an ontological politics, despite emerging from seemingly rational, post-political, and technocratic processes. Engaging with such politics is increasingly possible with access to geographical information systems, and this, therefore, provides a novel space in which to engage in political struggle. The case of externally mandated MSP in India demonstrates that non-state actors can initiate MSP, and therefore, opens the possibility for fishing communities, as non-state actors, to directly engage with the assemblage of practices that produce MSP. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s40152-020-00164-4,Blue economy;Commons;Community;Fishing territories;Marine spatial planning;Ontological politics;India;fishing community;GIS;government;holistic approach;industrial development;international aid;marine ecosystem;marine environment;spatial planning;traditional knowledge;Military Personnel,,,10.1007/s40152-020-00164-4,DOI(,10.1007/s40152-020-00164-4,DOI(10.1007/s40152-020-00164-4) OR,,,,,

In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities. © Copyright © 2020 Hoerterer, Schupp, Benkens, Nickiewicz, Krause and Buck.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2019.00795,adaptation;aquaculture;blue growth;fisheries;North Sea;seafood;tourism,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00795,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2019.00795,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.00795) OR,,,,,

Consisting of the ocean and ocean-related activities such as fisheries, port and shipping, deep sea mining, ocean energy, coastal tourism, ecosystem services and marine services, it offers huge potential for economic expansion. As countries compete over finite land resources, the next competition among countries is expected to be in the domain of ocean sector. Moreover, maritime transport continues to remain a crucial means of navigation and trade. Many Asian and African coastal nations have long coastlines and large coastal communities which could provide much-needed trigger to the process of economic development. For the purpose of planning for investment, employment, growth and non-traditional security issues, knowledge about potentials of Blue Economy sectors is paramount. For this purpose, understanding about ‘Stylised facts’ of the Blue Economy is necessary which is not available in the literature. Some of the key sectors linked with food security, nutritional security and livelihood security like the fishery sector is associated with Blue Economy. Eastern African countries such as Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Comoros and others are located in the Indian Ocean Rim. Their strategic location in the Indian Ocean provides huge opportunities for unleashing the potential of marine resources for the expansion of businesses, promoting entrepreneurship, increasing exports, creating jobs, and empowering the native coastal communities. With growing awareness about Blue Economy and the advancement of technologies, it can offer tremendous investment opportunities and provide a necessary trigger to the growth momentum. Despite long coastlines and endowment of various ocean resources, the Eastern African countries have not yet optimally harnessed this sector for the attainment of economic growth and other developmental objectives.

India committed to advance the “Blue Economy” and several programs have been initiated to promote blue economy in the country. One of the important components of promoting blue economy is to have adequate information about sea bed and mineral resources, in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), Legal Continental Shelf as well as High Seas. Apart from placer minerals on the coast, we need to explore for minerals, such as manganese nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt crusts in High Seas. The availability of gas hydrates on our continental shelf has huge potential to satisfy our ever-increasing energy requirements. We need to invest in developing technology and human resources to utilize these resources. At the same time, the development of offshore mineral and energy resources will need setting up of infrastructure facilities on the coast. As coastal zone is vulnerable to many hazards such as cyclones, storm surges, tsunamis, coastal erosion, sea level rise, etc., an assessment of coastal vulnerability to understand risks involved, has to be undertaken. Various environmental data will be required to utilize ocean resources.

A simplified parametric analysis of the structure is first carried out to propose a preliminary design of the platform. The preliminary design is subsequently investigated through hydro-elastic and aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled analyses. Modal analysis is performed through a 3D finite-element structural model. It confirms the feasibility of rigid-body hypothesis for the dynamic analysis of the support structure and manifests that the vibration modes of the structure are not excited by wave or wind loads. In order to assess the coupled dynamic responses, an aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled numerical model is developed. The motion and structural responses in operational and survival states are investigated. A modified mean up-crossing rate method has been employed to assess the ultimate limit state.

In this study, the concept and the scope of the blue economy are given, and the fishing activity, which is one of the crucial blue economy components, is emphasized. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports, fish stocks are decreasing due to overfishing in the world. It has been suggested that fisheries support is leading to overfishing and to the reduction of fish stocks. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether fisheries support causes overfishing and whether it is a problem for sustainable fish resources. In the Python program, a production model was estimated to analyze the relationship between fisheries production and fisheries support, the number of vessels and the number of fishermen in 37 countries between the years 2012 and 2017. According to the model, it was observed that the fisheries support, the number of vessels and the number of fishermen increase fish production, but there is not a high correlation between the variables. In order to remove the overfishing pressure on fish production, it is important to shift the fisheries support to the support types which are indirectly related with the fish output. © 2020, Centenary University.

Countries like Luxembourg and its space mining legislation seem to point out that only the Moon Agreement, and not the Outer Space Treaty, designates space resources as common heritage. Therefore, one wonders whether “not sharing” could trigger an aggressive way of exploiting the seabed ignoring the applicable environmental law regime.

We show that a sustainability narrative, in which the idea of fishing within ecological limits is present within government policy, public discourse, and practices, is, however, in contradiction with the realities of accumulation and growth that prevail in the fishery. When measures towards ecological preservation are to be taken, geopolitics of access to the sea and tuna enter the stage and change the position and narrative of the same actors, governments, and industrial actors that promote sustainability. We emphasize the difficult and nearly impossible path of practicing sustainability in the current model of growth-driven tuna fisheries.

Major commercial ports are fully integrated into transnational production and distribution systems, enabling the circulation of massive flows of energy and materials in the global economy. Port activity and development are usually associated with positive socio-economic effects, such as increased GDP and employment, but the industry’s continuous expansion produces adverse outcomes including air and water pollution, the destruction of marine and coastal environments, waterfront congestion, health risks, and labor issues. In its quest to marry economic growth and environmental sustainability in the maritime industries, proponents of the newly coined blue growth paradigm assume the negative impacts of ports and shipping to be fixable mostly through technological innovation. This paper questions the validity of the premise that the unlimited growth of the port and shipping industries is compatible with environmental sustainability and analyses the feasibility of technological improvements to offset the sector’s associated negative impacts. Based on insights from ecological economics and political ecology, ports can be described as power-laden assemblages of spaces, flows, and actors, which produce unequally distributed socio-ecological benefits and burdens at multiple scales. Focusing on the case of the Port of Barcelona, this study argues that the continuous expansion of port activity increases seldom accounted-for negative socio-environmental impacts, acquiring an uneconomic character for port cities and regions. In contrast, de-growth is presented as a radical sustainability alternative to ocean-based growth paradigms.

In parallel, capacity building actions are foreseen to boost the large potential of Macaronesian seaweeds as key elements of the local Blue Economy. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,aquaculture,Biotechnology",10.1007/s10811-019-01889-4,Azores;Blue economy;Cabo Verde;Canary Islands;Historical uses;Human nutrition and health;Macroalgae;Madeira;Middle East;Far East,,,10.1007/s10811-019-01889-4,DOI(,10.1007/s10811-019-01889-4,DOI(10.1007/s10811-019-01889-4) OR,,,,,

The way in which the Blue Economy is conceived and understood differs significantly across different sets of actors. A particular area of contestation exists around which ocean based industries or sectors can be considered to be ‘Blue’. This highlights the possibility of the Blue Economy becoming a forum through which the legitimacy of different private uses of ocean resources is contested and debated. The question of legitimacy of Blue Economy activities and sectors is explored through a critical engagement with the notion of a ‘social license to operate’ (SLO). Whilst SLO is normally considered in the context of individual businesses or developments, in this article we explore the applicability of SLO at a cross-sectoral scale. In doing so we examine how the concept of SLO may inform debates over appropriate private use of public ocean resources, and how this might influence the legitimacy of the broader concept of a Blue Economy. A case study involving a range of private sectors actors engaged in diverse ocean industries was conducted, drawing on interviews, a cross-sectoral survey and an interactive workshop with the ocean business community. The case study explores the role that SLO is currently playing in ocean industries. In particular we explore perceptions of who grants a SLO, what kind of concerns impact a SLO and how sectors work to obtain, or maintain, a SLO. By comparing the responses of individual sectors to these three critical questions, we identify that many of the SLO challenges currently being experienced by ocean industries relate to conflicting social and political values. This is creating a range of complex, sometimes irresolvable, SLO challenges for maritime industries, largely concentrated in sectors engaged in resource extraction, such as mining and oil and gas. In addition we find that attempts to address SLO challenges to date focus mostly on technical or technological adaptations. When comparing this to Blue Economy narratives we find that current engagement with SLO speaks primarily to interpretations of the Blue Economy which favour growth based narratives, and largely neglect competing discourses. This has considerable implications for the overall legitimacy of the Blue Economy, as the loss of SLO within one sector may undermine the credibility of the concept overall. This research highlights the importance of broader societal and political engagement in questions about appropriate use and management of private sector activities in the ocean. © 2019 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.02.020,Natural resources;Oceanography;Business community;Critical questions;Economic growth models;License to operate;Maritime industry;Private sectors;Resource extraction;Technological adaptation;business development;economic growth;gas production;marine resource;mining;oil production;private sector;resource development;resource management;Economics,,,10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.02.020,DOI(,10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.02.020,DOI(10.1016/j.resourpol.2019.02.020) OR,,,,,

However, despite this acknowledgement, the blue economy is championed for its development potential by the African Union and subsequently, several African states. Having formalised the agenda in its fifth National Development Plan Namibia is working to implement a governance and management framework to “sustainably maximise benefits from marine resources” by 2020 (Republic of Namibia in Namibia’s 5th National Development Plan (NDP5) 2017). Concurrently, new entrants, such as marine mineral mining projects, have emerged in recognition of the potential offered within the state’s Exclusive Economic Zone. This article argues that the uptake of the blue economy is shaped by multiple, and often conflicting, interests. The emergence of the agenda is not apolitical, nor has it been established in isolation from exogenous actors and interests. Subsequently, this article suggests that the critique of the emerging blue economy should be applied to discussions of a blue degrowth movement, to avoid transposing a new agenda over another. As demonstrated with reference to Namibia, contextual and historical issues need to be recognised by degrowth discussions, and their inherent and continued structural effects analysed. This is of particular importance when considering whose voices are represented or excluded by such agendas, complicated by the (geo)physical characteristics of the marine sphere. © 2019, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1007/s11625-019-00754-0,Blue degrowth;Blue economy;Degrowth;EEZ;Namibia;Seabed mining,,,10.1007/s11625-019-00754-0,DOI(,10.1007/s11625-019-00754-0,DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00754-0) OR,,,,,

This paper assesses the directions followed by the research and innovation activities performed by Portuguese organisations in the fields encompassed by the ""Blue Economy"", at the light of national and EU strategies. It analyses the projects developed by Portuguese actors in the context of European framework programmes to uncover: the areas privileged - namely the relative importance of emerging areas vs. new advances targeting established ones - and the relative position of different types of organisations in the developments taking place. The results point to stronger efforts in system domains related to marine resources and the marine environment and in some industry oriented domains. Among the latter, emerge new industries such as marine biotechnology and marine renewable energies and established industries exploiting marine living resources (fisheries, aquaculture). The results highlight the prominent position of research organisations in both new and established areas, as well as the relevant position of new technology intensive firms, in areas that require the development of application-oriented activities, where they often intermediate between research and industry. The results suggest that the international cooperation favoured by these projects permitted to open-up the national system, contributing to broaden the organisations' knowledge bases and to extend their international networks. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,non-targeted",10.1145/3372177.3373329,Blue economy;Innovation System;New Technology Intensive Firms;Portugal;Industrial research;Integrodifferential equations;International cooperation;Marine biology;Marine industry;Natural resources;Blue economies;Innovation system;International networks;Marine renewable energy;Portuguese organisations;Sustainable exploitation;Technology intensive firms;Industrial economics,,,10.1145/3372177.3373329,DOI(,10.1145/3372177.3373329,DOI(10.1145/3372177.3373329) OR,,,,,

It requires novel underwater networking concepts that are at the core of the described developed system. While IoUT has already been proposed by the authors for sake of environmental monitoring and marine exploration, in this demo we focus on how IoUT can bring novel opportunities in the field of underwater sport, leisure and tourism. In particular, the demo demonstrates FunDive, a novel wearable system for divers, developed in EC EASME ARCHEOSUb, that supports real-time monitoring of the divers positions and health conditions, at the same time allowing unprecedented enhanced visits of the sites. The system is composed of the following elements: a miniaturized underwater sensor node and an underwater tablet. The miniaturized underwater sensor node hosts an acoustics modem, the underwater networking and information compression logic, as well as a battery pack. The tablet is connected to the node and runs a dedicated APP. The system allows divers to communicate underwater, localize themselves/be localized, navigate to points of interest, and get displayed contents based on their position. A dedicated network protocol provides secure and reliable communication among divers and supports their localization. Our system has been developed by leveraging on the SUNSET Software Defined Communication Stack (S-SDCS) framework and its modular architecture and networking capabilities. In our demonstration we show, through an emulated underwater network environment, the flexibility and effectiveness of our system in allowing divers and surface operators to securely and reliably communicate using underwater tablets and acoustic networking. The navigation and acoustic tracking of divers will be also shown through a novel application interface. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: tourism,positive",10.1145/3323679.3326632,Diving;Localization;SUNSET;Underwater acoustic sensor networks;Acoustic logging;Battery Pack;Computation theory;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile security;Network protocols;Network security;Sensor networks;Sensor nodes;Environmental Monitoring;Information compression;Internet of underwater things;Reliable communication;Underwater acoustics;Internet,,,10.1145/3323679.3326632,DOI(,,,,,,,

Together, these two dimensions constitute the B&RI, providing the so-called Chinese ‘project of the century’ with regional, inter-regional and global reach. This book aims at assessing the impact of the B&RI in all these dimensions and levels of influence. This is a current and promising theme, not only in the short and medium terms, but also within a broader timescale, reflecting Chinese strategic thinking itself, since Chinese philosophy and culture are oriented towards long-term and inter-generational perspectives. Likewise, both the title of this publication and the way it has been organized result from the empirical perception that China asserts a conservative attitude towards foreign affairs, redesigned in multiple dimensions, to create a perception of domestic unity and global prestige. In this vein of thought, the B&RI is already influencing and will continue to influence, directly or indirectly, the current economic and political order. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1007/978-981-15-2564-3,"Afghanistan and China’s foreign policy;Belt and road initiative form a German perspective;BRI and the Portuguese speaking countries;BRI sustainable and inclusive growth and finance sources;Central and Eastern Europe, and the BRI;China and the great urban projects in cape verde;China-EU framework on the belt and road initiative;China’s ""16 + 1"" cooperation;China’s blue economy partnership;China’s outward direct investment (ODI) and BRI;China’s role in the international climate change regime;EU legal obstacles to the belt and road initiative;Financing of the belt and road initiative;India’s selective participation in China’s BRI;Latin America, the Caribbean, and BRI;Multiplex regionalism in central Asia;New silk roads and China’s grand strategy;Poland and the BRI;The EU’s blue growth strategy;Western hemisphere and the BRI",,,10.1007/978-981-15-2564-3,DOI(,,,,,,,

Post-harvest interventions in fisheries enable fishers and fish processors to reduce waste, maintain nutritional aspects and meet stringent demands in food quality and safety. This review highlights the benefits and pitfalls of various fish post-harvest management interventions in order to drive policy dialogue and formulation of a regulatory framework for future interventions. It relies on data obtained from the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute and the State Department of Fisheries and Blue Economy. Results depict abundant interventions in both handling and processing, but low utilization (<40% of installed cold rooms, dryers and smoking kilns) and multiplication by fishing communities. Fish products that target export markets have well-organized structures. However, a weak regulatory framework is a key constraint in addressing post-harvest management of fish intended for the domestic market. Under-utilization of installed interventions results in continued waste of fish, contributing to food and nutritional insecurity. This review recommends the development of an effective and integrative policy framework that involves interactions across different domains, institutional mechanisms that monitor and address those interactions, analytical bases for decision making, and multi-stakeholder dialogue for post-harvest management. Such policies will enhance the adoption of post-harvest technology in small-scale fisheries in Kenya and elsewhere. © 2019, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries",10.1007/s12571-019-00950-x,Fisheries;Food;Interventions;Nutrition;Post-harvest;Small-scale;fishery economics;fishery management;fishery policy;food availability;food quality;Gross Domestic Product;harvesting;nutritional status;regulatory approach;Kenya,,,10.1007/s12571-019-00950-x,DOI(,10.1007/s12571-019-00950-x,DOI(10.1007/s12571-019-00950-x) OR,,,,,

It is important to note that applying such a future planning has not always been an easy task due to the fact that managers in this field have not been particularly familiar with its importance of the sustainability marine tourism, blue economy and it is highly topical and timely to apply the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and blue economy approach in order to highlight the current situation in terms of existing capacities in environmental standard implementation, thus comprehending the level of sustainable practices in the country. The sustainable development of Marina described here, includes targets and goals pertinent to the implementation of directives and best practices which confirm that a marina has all the capacities and conditions to operate in an environmentally friendly manner. It is proposed that in order to offer services in the era of sustainability, marinas must adopt a SDG based on identifying and managing environmental issues and balance between people, profit and planet. Also, this paper addresses challenges facing SDG implementation to become green marina in the future. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 4 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: tourism,positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.31838/jcr.07.08.289,Environment;Green Marina;Marina industry;Pollution;Sustainability;Malaysia,,,10.31838/jcr.07.08.289,DOI(,10.31838/jcr.07.08.289,DOI(10.31838/jcr.07.08.289) OR,,,,,

This paper aims to identify dominating ideologies and strategies of Blue Growth in the Faroe Islands, mainly regarding salmon farming and industrial capture fisheries, and to investigate how these ideologies materialize in the social metabolism of Faroese society. The analysis approaches the Faroese Blue Economy from a holistic perspective using analytical concepts and frameworks of social (island) metabolism, environmental justice and degrowth to assess how current Blue Growth strategies pertain to long-term sustainability and human well-being. It offers a critical analysis of aquaculture in the Faroe Islands and shows that although the rhetoric around Blue Growth is framed within mainstreamed sustainability discourse, the ideologies and visions underpinning current Blue Growth strategies result in a continuation of conventional growth through the exploitation of new commodity frontiers. Finally, the negative consequences of Blue Growth are assessed and discussed through a mapping of recent and ongoing social and ecological distribution conflicts in the Faroes. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),aquaculture",10.1007/s11625-019-00763-z,Aquaculture;Blue degrowth;Environmental justice;Faroe Islands;Fisheries;Island metabolism;Social metabolism,,,10.1007/s11625-019-00763-z,DOI(,10.1007/s11625-019-00763-z,DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00763-z) OR,,,,,

These initiatives have drawn from the seven “OL Principles” that were developed by the College of Exploration OL Network in 2005. They represent a source of inspiration for the many endeavors that are aiming to achieve a society that fully understands the influence of themselves – as individuals and as a population – on the ocean and the influence of the ocean on them. OL initiatives throughout the past years, globally, have resulted in the production of countless didactic and communication resources that represent a valuable legacy for new activities. The OL research community recognizes the need to build up the scope of OL by reaching the wider Blue Economy actors such as the maritime industrial sector. It is hoped that building OL in this sector will contribute to the long-term sustainable development of maritime activities. The ERASMUS+ project “MATES” aims to address the maritime industries’ skills shortages and contribute to a more resilient labor market. MATES’ hypothesis is that through building OL in educational, professional and industrial environments, it is possible to build a labor force that matches the skills demand in these sectors and increases their capacity to uptake new knowledge. The MATES partnership will explicitly combine OL and knowledge transfer by applying the “COLUMBUS Knowledge Transfer Methodology” as developed by the H2020-funded COLUMBUS project. © Copyright © 2019 Fernández Otero, Bayliss-Brown and Papathanassiou.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2019.00646,blue economy;education;knowledge management;knowledge transfer;ocean literacy;skills;stakeholder engagement,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00646,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2019.00646,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.00646) OR,,,,,

Social license to operate (SLO), broadly defined as the public’s acceptance or approval of a company and its operations, is an emergent concept in New Zealand’s marine economy. The way the public discourse around SLO is constructed and communicated can empower some at the expense of others, whether deliberately or inadvertently. This study employed critical discourse analysis to investigate how SLO is used in public documents relating to commercial activities in New Zealand’s marine environment between 1996 and 2017. Specifically, the study explores the implied power relations between government, industry, New Zealand’s Indigenous tribes (hereafter, iwi), communities, and other stakeholders. We find that industry and central government dominate SLO-related public discourse, and they frequently vest SLO agency with industry rather than community groups, iwi, or the wider public. Indeed, iwi are largely absent from the SLO discourse in public documents. Definitions of SLO vary extensively across the documents and are largely captured by industry and central government. We conclude that New Zealand’s marine SLO public discourse empowers industry at the expense of communities and the public, contrary to the notional intent of the concept. © 2020 by the author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.5751/ES-11304-250102,Aquaculture;Blue economy;Corporate social responsibility;Deep sea mining;Fisheries;Oil and gas;Power;Public documents;New Zealand;conceptual framework;frequency analysis;local government;political system;power relations;stakeholder;Military Personnel,,,10.5751/ES-11304-250102,DOI(,10.5751/ES-11304-250102,DOI(10.5751/ES-11304-250102) OR,,,,,

The East African Marine Ecoregion is renowned for its richness in marine fauna and flora, including some of the Indian Ocean's most diverse and abundant coral reef ecosystems, making it a popular destination for scuba divers. However, empirical evidence suggests that external risks (international and domestic) are impacting on dive operators in the region, creating the need to better understand these impacts. This research was therefore aimed at identifying the most significant of these external risks from the perspective of dive operators, via an explorative and descriptive study. The qualitative and quantitative primary data collected revealed that domestic and international economic and political risks have the greatest impact on dive operators in the East African Marine Ecoregion, and this trend is expected to continue. Environmental degradation of coral reefs, while not seen as a threat to dive operators at present, constitutes a key threat within the near future. In terms of the variation in perceived risk across the region, Kenya suffers most from social and political risks, Tanzania from environmental risks, Mozambique from political risks, and South Africa from economic risks. The research contributes to Africa's Blue Economy, which aims to guide African countries in sustainable use of the marine environment while harnessing its social and economic benefits. The findings create awareness of the impact of external risks on regional dive operators and their significance. Furthermore, they create an opportunity for decision makers and stakeholders in the region to craft solutions to improve the sustainability of the scuba diving industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,tourism,Tier 1 (BE)",10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104897,Blue economy;Dive operators;Economic risks;Environmental risks;External risks;Marine protected area;Marine tourism;Political risks;Scuba diving industry;Social risks;Indian Ocean;Kenya;Mozambique;Tanzania;Anthozoa;Conservation;Decision making;Reefs;Sustainable development;Blue economies;Scuba diving;coral reef;economic impact;ecoregion;environmental economics;environmental risk;industrial development;marine environment;perception;political change;protected area;risk assessment;scuba diving;sustainability;sustainable development;tourism management;Industrial economics;Diving;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104897,DOI(,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104897,DOI(10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104897) OR,,,,,

We review what an equity-focused ‘Blue Economy’ might mean for some established and emergent marine sectors and note existing guidelines that may be used for incorporating these aspects into planning. Moving towards a Blue Economy does not only imply developing emerging sectors in undeveloped areas; larger challenges will be found in transforming industries that already have significant economic and livelihood contributions despite concurrent social and environmental concerns. A ‘marine industrial revolution’—as the Blue Economy has sometimes been understood—cannot achieve sustainable development and well-being if it does not avoid the widespread negative social and ecological impacts of historical development pathways.

Therefore, it is urgent to understand our oceans from a number of perspectives. In this paper, the concept of Smart Ocean (SO) is constructed from the perspectives of environmental protection, sustainable development of the blue economy and marine disaster prevention and mitigation. First, a double-funnel structure concept model of SO, including ocean observation infrastructure, data, information, application, knowledge and decision support layers, is put forward. Second, the differences between SO and Digital Ocean (DO) are analyzed. Third, taking the Decision Support System for Emergency at Taiwan Strait as an example, a case study, which has assisted in saving more than 200 people, is introduced. Finally, future research agenda is summarized into seven aspects, including new instrumentation and sensor technologies, ocean big data mining and knowledge discovering, prediction, forecast and uncertainty analysis, ocean environment protection technologies and policy, sustainable use of ocean energy and resource, the influence and response to global changes in the ocean, and interdisciplinary collaboration and public service. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Maybe } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1080/17538947.2019.1574317,digital ocean;marine disasters prevention and mitigation;Smart ocean;sustainable development;Data mining;Decision support systems;Disaster prevention;Disasters;Environmental protection;Planning;Sustainable development;Uncertainty analysis;Decision supports;Disaster prevention and mitigations;Interdisciplinary collaborations;Ocean observations;Sensor technologies;data mining;environmental protection;forecasting method;prediction;uncertainty analysis;virtual reality;Oceanography,,,10.1080/17538947.2019.1574317,DOI(,10.1080/17538947.2019.1574317,DOI(10.1080/17538947.2019.1574317) OR,,,,,

Their study is very difficult due to their scarcity, their flighty behavior, and their enormous displacements. In addition, some species feed in very deep waters and only emerge to breathe, or they live in hard to reach areas. However, few animals create so much wonder. What child or adult has not felt emotions when contemplating the spectacles of the killer whales, the pirouettes of the dolphins, or the immensity of the whales in the middle of the sea? Some of the authors of this book have been so moved to be surrounded by a group of fin whales that could not contain their tears. It is a difficult sensation to explain. One could try to summarize it by saying that these immense animals exhale peace. Seeing dolphins making capers around a boat or a group of fin whales suddenly emerging a few meters away is one of the greatest shows we can see in nature. In the presence of these animals, there is only a feeling of recollection. These are the moments when we see how small we humans are in this wonderful biosphere. Therefore, this book is a small tribute to these beautiful living beings. Something we owe them. We have to protect these animals, but we cannot do so without knowing them. In this text, the authors provide key information to understand the evolution of cetaceans, their patterns of movement and behavior, always under a conservation perspective. This book has been written by 15 leading specialists from three different countries and with different backgrounds ranging from biology to veterinary science. They are united by a common interest, a passion. The book does not focus on a single species, but covers studies with dolphins, sperm whales, and fin whales, as well as various methodological approaches that provide key data to understand the evolution of up to 50 different species. Many diverse aspects have been covered and, above all, new methodological approaches have been provided in areas such as acoustics, the study of spatial and feeding behavior, evolution, social interactions, and even blue economics. As if this were not enough, the authors wish to highlight the immense amount of data that has been used. The first chapter on fin whales is based on hundreds of sightings over several years, and dozens of satellite images on various environmental parameters. Chapter two covers hundreds of recordings of the sounds of humpback whales around the world. Chapter three has followed the sperm whale populations of the Strait of Gibraltar over several years with hundreds of sightings. Chapters four and five study the evolution of more than fifty species through hundreds of recordings using qualitative and quantitative approaches, respectively. The sixth chapter compares the behavior of two species of dolphins. Finally, chapter seven designs a new line of study for these animals: the blue economy. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This is because for India, it is the outer limit of the Indo-Pacific, and South Pacific acts as the new periphery of its Act East policy. Many ASEAN nations are deliberating about the utility of the Indo-Pacific. In the past, the then Indonesia Foreign Minister Marty Natalagewa had proposed the Indo-Pacific treaty and in 2019, ASEAN discussed the new geo-strategic construct despite variations in the approach and subscription. For India, South Pacific has three major objectives catering to its Act East policy; its need for supporting votes for its Security Council permanent member seat, Indian diaspora in the region, and harnessing sea bed mineral resources with island nations under the blue economy concept. However, whether India does have the desire or is just scouting for resources and therefore wants to protect its strategic interest across the Indo-Pacific region needs further scrutiny.

Several key operations and parameters were monitored during the research, including containers spreader movements, physical characteristics of the cables, metal constructions. Initial results suggested that crane operators' involvement in the control of the cargo movement produced incorrect control patterns (joystick movements) that delayed port operations. Each control movement of the joystick needs to have a direct real-time feedback from the spreader (actual movement of the cargo).

The objective of this paper is to analyse the directions followed by the research and technological development (RTD) activities conducted by Portuguese firms in order to understand whether the strategies and policies aiming at the development of the Blue Economy are being effective in their endeavour of steering such development in certain directions, thus creating conditions for a sustainable transformation in ocean related areas. The results provide some evidence of the role being performed by RTD promoted by these policies towards a transformative change in ocean related activities.

Moreover, the results show intense interaction between different types of organisations. Particularly, they show that new technology intensive firms and industries are working together with existing firms from traditional sectors to exploit the new opportunities and technologies.

Climate Changes, ecosystems unbalances, natural resources depletion, pollution, extreme events, natural catastrophes, humanized overpopulated environments, as well as economical turbulences, represent more than ever, very uncertain terms of an equation that is difficult to balance. Novel procedures are essential to make use of local and global information that is nowadays available from multiple sources, to produce intelligible and actionable models for sustainable development, in particular for the oceans protection, the main support of human life on earth. An example of this procedures is the Oceans Accounts (OA) framework that aims at integrating the biophysical information, measure ecosystem services, track and measure the changes on the ecosystems and link all this data to economic and human activity within a given spatial area. This work presents a novel approach that uses spatial modeling techniques capable of dealing with limited and discrete data, such as Geostatistics. These spatial techniques, combined with remote sensing, can provide a sound background of information for the implementation and leverage of the Oceans Accounts framework. Moreover, an emphasis will be given to the application of the OA framework to marine protected areas (MPA's) with an identification of the main gaps regarding the cycle of collecting, processing and integrating social, environmental and economic data.

In many cases, however, the natural environment is transformed as an unjustified receiver of pollutants produced by tourism activities, which could be possible, degraded the environment and disturb the ecological balance. This fact activated an original research effort to study whether the potential ecological and environmental distortions in the island were to be identified so that a tourism policy could be adapted to the island's natural environment. During the data collection, tourist accommodation was recorded in all Lefkada's municipalities by additional data collection of natural, cultural, human and artificial environment. The resulting data were further processed with software programs and showed that the geological specificity of Lefkada's island affects the spatial arrangement and distribution of local and seasonal tourist populations. As an impact of this, the potential zones of pressure in Lefkada are separated into coastal outer zone and two inner, semi-mountainous zones. The coastal zone receives the highest pressure and has the highest potential for pollution, mainly on the north and east sides of the island, due to the existence of ports and natural anchors and the explosive development of small and multi-purpose tourist accommodation within 2 Km of the coastline.

High-density population resides in coastal and islandic regions of these countries and with climate change, rising sea level is seen an imminent danger to the coastal community in the low-lying area. To counter the rising sea level, countries are looking for technologies to support the displaced coastal population by embarking on floating homes and floating cities in their Blue Growth strategy to support living space and amenities needs. Since these floating homes and cities are powered through fossil fuel there is a need to preserve the Coastal marine ecology from the emissions. This paper discusses about powering the floating homes through ocean based floating clean energy systems as a cost-effective energy system that can be manufactured, assembled and maintained in the onshore and easily towed and deployed at a specific ocean site and assure energy security and resilience even during natural disasters. In addition, the paper discusses the idea of hybrid renewable powered energy systems to exploit the multiple available energy sources at the specific site viz., tidal, ocean thermal, wave, solar and wind that may vary in different proportion of availability to increase overall energy generation density from the ocean site. To illustrate, a case study of floating tidal system is discussed that was designed and deployed in Singapore towards tropical shallow water conditions through systematic resource assessment, device design through simulation and field based assessment. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/978-981-13-8743-2_19,Floating structure;Renewable energy;Smart grid;Tidal energy;Wave energy;Climate change;Cost effectiveness;Disasters;Ecosystems;Energy policy;Energy security;Fossil fuels;Population statistics;Sea level;Smart power grids;Tidal power;Floating structures;Renewable energies;Wave energy conversion,,,10.1007/978-981-13-8743-2_19,DOI(,10.1007/978-981-13-8743-2_19,DOI(10.1007/978-981-13-8743-2_19) OR,,,,,

Different types of ocean governance are recognised worldwide in countries ranging from law-centred practices to planning across set periods of time. Australia coasts and oceans have three layers of government with institutional arrangements across many layers of actors. Trends indicate uncertainty for many listed species, despite improving management in some areas, as reported in the Australian State of the Environment publications. Environmental governance has recently been used as a solution to deal with the scale of environmental problems of oceans and the associated blue economy. Environmental governance has dealt with processes of efficiency, effectiveness, institutional arrangements, social justice and capacity building, but much of this literature focuses on process and lacks an outcome and performance orientation.

Clearly there are many combinations and many value propositions. However, most technologies to date are considered blue sky concepts, with little robust techno-economic analysis demonstrating profitability. The paper begins by providing a comprehensive review of Blue Growth and multi-use in Blue Growth; both in policy as well as the wide range of current technologies, including ocean energy, offshore wind energy, offshore aquaculture and desalination. The Maribe H2020 project provides the vehicle for the research element of the paper. The major contribution is a new methodology for selecting, filtering, developing and ranking business propositions for multiple-use of space (MUS) and multi-use platforms (MUP). Application of the method for the first time identified three case studies where Blue Growth combination projects can be economically viable, with attractive internal rate of return (IRRs). Results presented for the case studies report standard investment metrics and show the relative contribution of each product (energy, food, water) to the system profitability, as well as socio-economic impact. Existing companies were fully engaged in the process. Co-creation between sector experts and industry led to both improved business value propositions and robust assessment of investment readiness. In contrast to the presumption that large scale platforms are commercially attractive, the highest ranking case study companies required smaller capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operated in niche subsectors. In conclusion, the positive economic performance of the case studies should provide confidence for the EC as well as investors that MUS and MUP have viable economic futures leading towards commercialisation.

It is necessary for the high-quality development of marine economy to promote environment-based technological progress. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the biased technological progress and its influencing factors of China’s marine economy from 2002 to 2016. We used a DEA-Malmquist model to measure the biased technological progress. Then we further analyzed influencing factors of biased technological progress. Our research found that the TFP of the marine economy was basically growing, and this growth was mainly due to a positive impact of technological progress. In general, the technological progress of marine economy is gradually biased towards energy conservation and emissions reduction. Furthermore, technological progress in the Yangtze River Delta are more conducive to energy conservation. The marine economic production in the Pan-Pearl River Delta is more inclined to promote production growth, while tit is most concerned about environmental protection in the Bohai Rim region. In addition, factors such as environmental regulation, economic level, FDI and industrial scale have different impacts on biased technological progress of marine economy. The results show that the directive regulations have a greater impact on the input-biased technological progress, while the incentive regulations have a greater impact on the output-biased technological progress. Therefore, this study has important guiding significance for energy conservation and emission reduction of marine economy in China.

In this chapter five connecting themes are identified, which draw together the threads weaving through the chapters of this book, specifically: the transnational nature of maritime threats, the role played by territoriality, the blue security nexus, the contribution of non-state actors to the maritime domain, and, lastly, the impact of technological developments. Further to connecting these dots, we synthesise a number of policy recommendations that emanate from within the chapters of this volume. These centre on cooperation (particularly in capacity building and information-sharing), appreciating the role of geopolitics and actively acknowledging this through the necessary legal instruments, an integrated approach toward sea-based economic activity, the need for platforms where private and public stakeholders can come together to coalesce around solutions to key problems, and preparing for and leaning on the challenges and opportunities presented by technological advances. Distilled further from this is the importance of maritime domain awareness, as policy interventions at the state-, regional-, and international levels all require an accurate picture of what is happening in the maritime domain.

From the vantage points of political economy and geopolitics, this article investigates the potential ramifications of this shift in funding for large-scale marine protected areas (LMPAs), which have been widely promoted to enhance marine biodiversity and manage sustainable fisheries. Specific attention is given to the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) in Kiribati, where finance from US-based philanthropic foundations is intended to support the operation and management of the LMPA and eventually compensate the government for forgone revenues from fishing licences, via the creation of a trust fund. Content analysis of key documents is conducted to empirically trace the political, legal, and financial evolution of PIPA. The findings demonstrate how, in accepting finance from philanthropic foundations, the government of Kiribati gradually relinquishes its decision-making leverage over PIPA's territory and resources. Hence, it is contended that certain legal and financial provisions could act as under-acknowledged and purposive drivers of ‘ocean-control grabbing’. Results further reveal that achieving financial sustainability for the PIPA conservation trust fund has proven difficult, opening up discussions on the extent to which PIPA could be capitalised in other ways. More broadly, the paper engages with recent debates on for-profit conservation, ocean grabbing, and the blue economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Others,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2019.01.010,Blue economy;Environmental governance;For-profit conservation;Impact investing;Ocean grabbing;SIDS;Kiribati;Phoenix Islands;conservation management;decision making;environmental management;financial system;governance approach;marine environment;political economy;protected area;sustainability,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.01.010,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.01.010,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2019.01.010) OR,,,,,

In response to ensuing public outcries, governmental agencies, and researchers across the globe began mobilizing around alternative biofuel feedstock. Among these materials, algae emerged as the most “hopeful” sustainable alternative in producing biofuels. This article examines algal biofuel production systems designed offshore and integrated with wastewater treatment and carbon dioxide absorption processes to revitalize faith in biofuels in the blue economy. It discusses what makes algal biofuels sustainable by examining the ways practitioners talk about and design these integrated systems. Against the common refrain that algae’s photosynthetic and reproductive capacity makes these systems sustainable, this article underlines that there is nothing natural, innate, about algae to add to sustainable blue economies. Rather, algae become naturalized as biofuel source and bioremediation technologies through technoscientific discourses and interventions, which embed and reproduce anthropocentric approach to sustainability that centers on the ideology of growth. By drawing particular attention to the ways that integrated algal biofuel production systems depend on the constant generation of industrial waste, this article problematizes anthropocentric sustainability imaginaries and claims for imagining sustainability otherwise through the lens of blue degrowth to create a radical socio-ecological change. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Energy,negative,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s11625-019-00766-w,Algae;Biofuels;Blue degrowth;Imaginaries;Science and technology studies;Sustainability,,,10.1007/s11625-019-00766-w,DOI(,10.1007/s11625-019-00766-w,DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00766-w) OR,,,,,

The growth of the industrial fleet led to an initial increase in global catches from the 1950s to the 1990s; yet, today, several marine fish stocks are harvested at unsustainable rates, and catches are stagnating. As a result, industrial fishers increase investments and fishing effort, reaching farther and deeper, while small-scale fishers face the threat of disappearance as both their catches and livelihoods worsen. The emergent international emphasis on Blue Growth is likely to put further pressure on marine capture fisheries. This paper explores how the growth imperative in the seas has manifested itself in Turkey since the 1970s and how industrial and small-scale fishers responded to this growth spiral in the seas. Based on participant observation methods and in-depth interviews, this paper problematizes the expanding boundaries of industrial fishers and examines the reactions of small-scale fishing cooperatives in Istanbul, in particular their proposed alternative economic model, as a response to the growth imperative. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the crisis that small-scale fishers are facing not only presents economic and ecological difficulties, but also represents an existential threat to the identity and traditional ways of life as a fisher. The strategies adopted by small-scale fishers in response to this crisis in Turkey, especially in Istanbul, are politicizing fishers as they open up new spaces, collaborations, and demands for environmental, social, and economic justice. However, their efforts constitute an ongoing process prone to numerous tensions and contradictions. This paper concludes that challenging the growth paradigm in fisheries via the Blue Degrowth framework can be useful for analyzing emerging alternative imaginaries to the growth-driven capitalist economic system among small-scale fishers. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s11625-019-00748-y,Alternatives;Blue Economy;Coastal fisheries;Degrowth;Food sovereignty;Industrial fisheries;Military Personnel,,,10.1007/s11625-019-00748-y,DOI(,10.1007/s11625-019-00748-y,DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00748-y) OR,,,,,

The concept and practice have spawned a rich, and diverse, body of scholarly activity. Yet despite this emerging body of literature, there is ambiguity around what the blue economy is, what it encapsulates, and its practices. Thus far, the existing literature has failed to theorise key geographical concepts such as space, place, scale, and power relations, all of which have the potential to lead to uneven development processes and regional differentiation. Previous research has sought to clarify the ontological separation of land and sea or has conceptualised the blue economy as a complex governmental project that opens up new governable spaces and rationalises particular ways of managing marine and coastal regions. More recently, geographers have called for a critical—and practical—engagement with the blue economy. This paper critically examines the existing literature of the geographies of the blue economy through a structured meta-analysis of published work, specifically its conceptualisations and applications to debates in the field. Results offer the potential to ground a bottom-up definition of the blue economy. In so doing, this paper provides a clearly identifiable rubric of the key geographical concepts that are often overlooked by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners when promoting economic development and technological innovation in coastal and marine environments. © 2019 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1111/gec3.12445,coastal zone;conceptual framework;economic development;economics;innovation;marine environment;power relations;uneven development,,,10.1111/gec3.12445,DOI(,10.1111/gec3.12445,DOI(10.1111/gec3.12445) OR,,,,,

The analysis revealed that this included coastal tourism, fisheries, aquaculture, port activities, and maritime transport. Several sectors, including coastal tourism and aquaculture, ensure the implementation of a long-term Blue Growth strategy.

The demand for ocean data to inform scientific, risk reduction, and national security needs is leading to a large increase in the number of deployed ocean observation and monitoring systems, most of which require increased power. Because ocean observation systems are often placed in remote locations, they primarily rely on energy storage (or in some cases in situ energy generation) to power instruments and equipment, which imposes limits on sampling rates, deployment times, and spatiotemporal resolution of data. The U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies Office is exploring the potential for marine renewable energy (MRE) devices (largely wave and tidal energy converters) to provide power to support multiple blue economy opportunities. A portion of these opportunities focus on power at sea markets for providing power in off-grid and offshore locations to support a variety of ocean-based activities, including ocean observation and navigation, underwater vehicle charging, marine aquaculture, marine algae farming, and seawater mining. Initially, research has focused on better understanding how and where MRE can provide a consistent source of reliable power to extend ocean observing missions, including operation of autonomous underwater vehicles. Online surveys as well as phone and in-person interviews were conducted with experts in the field of ocean observing systems and observatories to gather end-user requirements, determine energy needs, identify opportunities for codevelopment, and pinpoint constraints for MRE to meet those needs. The surveys and interviews provided feedback on the potential for powering devices and vehicles using MRE, including identifying common themes and challenges that will inform foundational research and development steps needed to advance the integration of MRE with ocean observing systems.

We validated this circular approach with two iterations of mapathons and hackathons, and found that 1) the size and location of the map area need to be carefully chosen; 2) those creating the apps needed a huge amount of help in dealing with the geospatial data; and 3) any geospatial data is useful for the blue economy, not only data with a very specific purpose in the blue economy context, such as coastal access points. Overall, the geospatial data usability improved from one iteration to another and would certainly improve if more iterations were added.

Ocean governance policy formulation requires trade-offs that are valuation dependent across the economic, social and environmental domains for the mitigation of both inter-sectoral and sectoral-environmental conflicts and sustainable and equitable resource use encapsulated within the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Maritime safety and security are critical within such governance frameworks and are both enablers of the blue economy (through asset and revenue protection) and a potential sectoral source of economic development and growth within blue economies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1007/978-3-030-34630-0_2,Blue economy;Ocean economy;Ocean governance;Sustainable development,,,10.1007/978-3-030-34630-0_2,DOI(,10.1007/978-3-030-34630-0_2,DOI(10.1007/978-3-030-34630-0_2) OR,,,,,

In efforts at calculating the potential economic value of the ocean, policy-oriented documents seek to unite diverse actors around common goals. Through the calculation of numbers, large-scale and long-term policy visions are being crystallized. But how do such numbers come into being in practice? This article interrogates this question with an example from the Norwegian context: the established policy goal of a so-called ‘five-fold increase’ in marine value creation in the year 2050. While powerful numbers are commonly expected to be produced through the procedures of ‘mechanical objectivity’ that involve strict quantification and scientific methods, our analysis shows a rather different route towards a powerful number: By loosely combining tools developed for business management, the number is calculated by, first, openly combining qualitative and narrative operations into the calculation and then, next, decoupling qualitative uncertainties from the quantified potential. The result is a calculative process that takes the form of what we suggest to call ‘reflexive objectivity’ and a policy-oriented number that encourages risk-taking and action over restraint and precaution. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1080/17530350.2019.1639066,Blue economy;business tools;document analysis;numbers;objectivity;H-Reflex,,,10.1080/17530350.2019.1639066,DOI(,10.1080/17530350.2019.1639066,DOI(10.1080/17530350.2019.1639066) OR,,,,,

This move towards the “blue economy” is becoming globally widespread, with the recognition that if ocean-based activities are to be sustainable, they will need to move beyond solely extractive and exploitative endeavours, aligning more closely with marine conservation and effective marine spatial planning. In this paper we define the “blue economy” as a “platform for strategic, integrated and participatory coastal and ocean development and protection that incorporates a low carbon economy, the ecosystem approach and human well-being through advancing regional industries, services and activities”. In Peru, while the seas contribute greatly to the national economy, the full potential of the blue economy has yet to be realised. This paper presents the findings of an early career scientist workshop in Lima, Peru, in March 2016. The workshop “Advancing Green Growth in Peru” brought together researchers to identify challenges and opportunities for green growth across three Peruvian economic sectors—tourism, transport and the blue economy with this paper exploring in detail the priorities generated from the “blue economy” stream. These priorities include themes such as marine spatial planning, detailed evaluations of existing maritime industries (e.g. guano collection and fisheries), development of an effective MPA network, support for sustainable coastal tourism, and better inclusion of social science disciplines in understanding societal and political support for a Peruvian blue economy. In addition, the paper discusses the research requirements associated with these priorities. While not a comprehensive list, these priorities provide a starting point for future dialogue on a co-ordinated scientific platform supporting the blue growth agenda in Peru, and in other regions working towards a successful “blue economy”. © 2018, The Author(s).","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1007/s10668-018-0133-z,Blue economy;Blue growth;Marine;Society;Sustainability;Lima [Peru];Peru;economic activity;economic growth;marine policy;research work;spatial planning;sustainability;sustainable development,,,10.1007/s10668-018-0133-z,DOI(,10.1007/s10668-018-0133-z,DOI(10.1007/s10668-018-0133-z) OR,,,,,

Reframing it as a ‘blue fix’, we argue that the blue growth discourse facilitates new opportunities for capital accumulation, while claiming that this accumulation is compatible with social and ecological aims as well. The blue fix is made up of three underlying sub-fixes. First of all, the conservation fix quenches the social thirst for action in the face of climate change. Here we see how protecting marine areas can be an important part of mitigating climate change, but in practice, gains at the national level are overshadowed by the ongoing expansion of offshore drilling for oil and gas. Second, the protein fix satisfies the growing global demand for healthy food and nutrition through the expansion of capital-intensive large-scale aquaculture, while ignoring the negative socio-ecological impacts, which effectively squeeze small-scale capture fishing out, while industrial capture fishing remains well positioned to expand into as well as supply industrial aquaculture with fish feed from pelagic fish. And third, an energy fix offers a burst of wind energy and a splash of new deep-sea minerals without disturbing the familiar and persistent foundation of oil and gas. This dimension of the blue fix emphasizes the transition to wind and solar energy, but meanwhile the deep sea mining for minerals required by these new technologies launches us into unknown ecological territories with little understood consequences. The synergy of these three elements brought together in a reframing of ocean politics manifests as a balancing act to frame blue growth as ‘sustainable’ and in everyone’s interest, which we critically analyze and discuss in this article. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1007/s11625-019-00777-7,Aquaculture;Blue economy;Blue growth;Deep sea mining;Marine protected areas;Oil and gas,,,10.1007/s11625-019-00777-7,DOI(,10.1007/s11625-019-00777-7,DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00777-7) OR,,,,,

The forthcoming UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) provides an opportunity to engage with the sea more widely but it is argued that the cultural element provided by considering past human action is currently lacking. The importance of understanding human interaction with the sea in terms of gaining a more complete picture of human history is briefly presented and a definition of MCH as all past action in the human zone is given. The article then sets out how MCH can enhance sustainable development in the marine zone with particular reference to SDG14 considering heritage tourism, coastal development and infrastructure, development aid policy, climate change, coastal management, fisheries and the offshore industry. The article highlights that the knowledge and data from MCH should be seen as crucial in evidence-based decision making across the coastal and marine sectors.

In this paper, we engage with theoretical and empirical observations to reflect on how the promise of sustainable economic growth arising from the convergence of international conservation policies and the blue growth paradigm, has failed to materialise and caused huge social and economic inequities among local fishing communities and the catastrophic disruption of the socio-ecological system of fisheries. Drawing on various interventions in Malta, we illustrate how neoliberal policies, lauded and promoted as part of a national blue growth strategy, are suffocating and marginalising small-scale fishingcommunities by concentrating fishing opportunities into fewer, larger corporate hands, and by a hegemonic anti-small scale fishing narrative that seeks to replace traditional fishing with the ‘darlings of the new blue economy’, aquaculture and coastal tourism. With artisanal-commercial fishing in Malta on the verge of extinction, we call for reversal of neo-liberal policy measures to re-create a more resilient and stable fisheries economy through specific blue degrowth measures including improved access to fisheries resources and markets, and the establishment of marine protected areas that recognize the value of small-scale fisheries to conservation. This could be achieved through equity-based governance systems, including improved profit distribution systems within community economies, that grant small-scale fisheries the possibility of re-institutionalizing their sector and promoting their existence and viability into the future. Ultimately, we demonstrate that through a blue economy roadmap for small-scale fisheries, small-islands states like Malta, can rescue an important component of their maritime traditions, and be better placed to reach the obligations set out within the United Nations sustainable development goals. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,fisheries,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1007/s11625-019-00769-7,Community economies;Conservation policies;Neoliberalism;Redistribution;Sustainable development goals;Tuna;Military Personnel,,,10.1007/s11625-019-00769-7,DOI(,10.1007/s11625-019-00769-7,DOI(10.1007/s11625-019-00769-7) OR,,,,,

Whilst DSM’s proponents locate it as emergent part of a blue economy narrative, its critics point to the ecological and economic uncertainty that characterises the proposed practice. Yet, due its extreme geography, DSM is also profoundly elusive to direct human experience and thus presents a challenge to forms of resistance against an industry extolled as having ‘no human impact’. Against this background, this paper analyses the ways in which ‘blue degrowth’—as a distinct form of counter-narrative—might be ‘performed’, and which imagined (and alternative) geographies are invoked accordingly. To do this it critically reflects upon 2 years of participatory research in the Duke of York Islands focusing on three, community-developed methods of resisting DSM.

To date, most MRE development has fo-cused on utility-scale electrical grid generation, but a growing body of work fo-cuses on non-grid applications in the blue economy where MRE could provide power on-site and at the scale needed for specific maritime sectors. One of the blue economy sectors with promising applications for MRE is ocean observations using both mobile and stationary platforms. This paper documents the steps and results of engaging with experts across the myriad ocean observation platforms and capabilities to inform five use cases. These use cases include descriptions of specific ocean observation applications performing measurements of high socie-tal value (e.g., data for weather forecasting and tsunami detection) that closely resemble specific sensing systems and, in most cases, are placed in a particular area of the ocean. Rapid resource assessments (i.e., first-order estimates) were performed at these locations to determine the suitability of marine and other renewable energy sources. From the information gathered so far, MRE has signif-icant potential to enable improved ocean observation missions, expand ocean observing capacity, and develop as an industry in parallel with the needs of our changing oceans. © 2020, Marine Technology Society Inc.

Decommissioning usually has an adverse effect on the environment aside from its economic intensity. By proper planning, lifetime of existing offshore infrastructure can be extended as it can be used for blue energy or other activities related to the blue economy. The paper deals with preliminary assessment of natural gas offshore infrastructure applicability for various blue energy options such as the wind power for electricity generation along with hydrogen, methane or ammonia production and other uses to reduce waste, energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Methods used included data gathering from 19 offshore gas facilities including assessment of natural gas production on current offshore fields, reserves and technology use, wind potential and decommissioning. Review of potential for energy production, storage and other activities such as CCS and CCU have also been given. Preliminary results show that there are possibilities for feasible and environmentally friendly blue energy utilisation. Average calculated capacity factors for the wind turbines are at the 32%.

Through analysing the Blue Growth and marine service value chain as well as user requirements, a list of value-added products has been identified for two user groups: a public group for planning and managing the OWFs and OWF siting sector. Fit-for-the-purpose assessment is carried out to identify data adequacy for OWF siting per key variable in air, water, biota, seabed and human activity areas and per data characteristics, e.g. spatiotemporal coverage, resolution, timeliness, quality and accessibility. Major data gaps lie in observations of wind profiles, currents, sea ice thickness, bottom slope, sedimentation rate, grain size and transport. The results suggest that a community marine data service for OWF siting should be an integrated data portal with open and free data access.

Although more remote sensing and in situ data are available than ever before, however, oceanographic and marine forecasting expertise in the region is limited. To support capacity building in these areas, the Climate and Oceans Support Program in the Pacific (COSPPac) has engaged with partners in the National Meteorological Services (NMS) and other relevant agencies in 14 Pacific Island nations, to identify priorities and to develop tools and training to address these needs. A key tool is the online Pacific Ocean Portal. With a focus on the Pacific Islands region, this website provides ocean data relevant to a range of sectors and applications such as tourism, fishing, shipping, coastal inundation, and environmental management. Via a user-friendly interface, the portal serves up data from a variety of sources including near real-time observations, historical information and forecast data. Training modules have been designed for portal users and delivery has gone hand-in-hand with in-country stakeholder engagement workshops, allowing sector users to make requests for ocean information products. Eight workshops have been delivered from November 2015 to June 2018, training a total of 97 NMS staff and 116 ocean sector stakeholders including port authorities, disaster management, tourism, fisheries, community leaders, and many more. As a result, five Pacific Island NMSs (Tonga, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Samoa, and Vanuatu) are now producing monthly Ocean Outlooks, guided by the needs of in-country stakeholders.

African islands of the western Indian Ocean, however, have been involved in it for more than twenty years through the exploitation of their 'blue gold': tuna. In this article, we use Ribot and Peluso's (2003) ""theory of access"" to map the different ways actors access tuna under diverse socio-economic contexts and how power relations are created through different mechanisms of access. We show that rights-based mechanisms such as fishing access agreements are highly questionable for their fairness and sustainability but bring benefits such as funding for fisheries-related infrastructures and projects. We also show that access to the resource is dependent on knowledge held by fishers, on technological advances as well as on diverse labor relations. These mechanisms significantly impact the quantity of fish that can be accessed by artisanal versus industrial market sectors, and generate narratives of unequal access to tuna. Furthermore, we take into consideration the materiality of tuna as a highly mobile resource in a space of fluid boundaries, to show how the fish can be an actant in shaping access but also how fishing practices can produce new materialities. Based on the above evidence, we propose an enhancement of the theory of access to consider the role of materiality of the resources and the sea. We conclude that to ensure that tuna fisheries continue to contribute to the blue economy of African islands, stakeholders need to balance between the diverse benefits produced by the fisheries and the uneven power relations that can arise, and to integrate the impact of a material sea and fish in this reflection. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 9 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,Tier 1 (BE)",10.2458/v26i1.23040,Fishers;Knowledge;Madagascar;Materiality;Mauritius;Power relations;Seychelles;Spatiality of the sea;Technology;Indian Ocean;Indian Ocean (West);Scombridae;fishery management;fishing community;management practice;political economy;power relations;stakeholder,,,10.2458/v26i1.23040,DOI(,10.2458/v26i1.23040,DOI(10.2458/v26i1.23040) OR,,,,,

It shows how Chinese MNCs deploy their superior technologies to exploit the management gap, thereby undermining resources of the West Africa‟s continental shelves and exclusive economic zones (EEZ) with impunity. The article draws from liberal political economy approach to argue for appropriate technology transfer from developed states to West Africa so that artisanal fishers would be able to fish and export the excess to international market. In doing so, the fishers contribute to the region‟s efforts to achieve the Goals 1 and 2 of the SDGs. © 2019 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

Blue economy is a phrase which includes the aforementioned green economy and circular economy. Although green economy was first brought to agenda at the United Nations sustainable development summit in Rio de Janerio in 2012, it was mainly perceived as terrestrial-based especially by small island countries, and it was concluded not to be sufficiently marine-based. Circular economy is an idea which proposes that resources should be used within the circle, each waste should be used in another production process, and thus resources will not disappear and pollution will not occur. Blue economy, which involves and develops both approaches, has become widespread in most countries by proposing the prevention of environmental pollution and the further use of marine economy. The idea of using marine for economic gains is not new. However, blue economy aims to increase the use of marine and to create as much economic value as possible from the marine environment by including new technologies and public policies in line with the market needs. It also aims to protect marine resources and the ecosystem in a sustainable manner as well as economic gains. The relationship between marine and humans will be reshaped along with the implementation of a blue economy, which is successful and has been able to reach the desired level. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2019 All rights reserved.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",,Turkey;Turkeys,,,The blue economy in Turkey,TITLE(,The blue economy in Turkey,TITLE(The blue economy in Turkey) OR,,,,,

In developing, applying, and critically appraising a definition of the BE in one of the largest fresh-water systems in the world, our work identifies how regional characteristics and intersectoral conflicts can pose issues to both policymakers and researchers. The use of standard metrics (e.g. location quotients) allows us to compare our findings with previous works conducted in other regions. From this comparison, and by comparing inter-state differences, we find that the BE in the region comprises highly-productive clusters, although employment specialization remains low. In addition, several BE clusters are dominated by industries that are different compared to those in other regions.

This paper explores current regulatory and policy base for Australia offshore resource and environmental management. The paper outlines and highlights the strong influence of “offshore federalism”, the constitutional, legal and political frameworks that shape the management of offshore activities and the protection of the marine environment. The paper provides a snapshot overview of Australia's maritime domain and the opportunities and challenges associated with emerging blue economy activities. The paper concludes with an assessment of regulatory and policy coherence, capacity and alignment of current policy settings underpinning blue economy operations. Development an effective policy framework for the emergent blue economy Australia will enhance and complement a range of current activities in the 'marine and coastal 'space'. It will also have considerable links to current initiatives in maritime Australia. A focus on vertical and horizontal governance, and of institutional arrangements to address problems related to maritime issues also addresses the question of policy capacity and coherence.

Here, environmental data collection and archiving by oil and gas operators in the North Sea are described, alongside how this compares to other offshore industries; what the barriers and opportunities surrounding environmental data sharing are; and how wider data sharing from offshore industries could be achieved. Five primary barriers to data sharing were identified: 1) Incentives, 2) Risk Perception, 3) Working Cultures, 4) Financial Models, and 5) Data Ownership.

Experiences from small-scale marine fisheries and seabed mining illustrate how ethical frameworks, civic participation and formalised guidance combine in the context of a ""blue economy"". Three lines of inquiries contextualise these experiences driving research questions, such as ""what is the function of ethics for governability?"" First, complex-adaptive SES are featured to emphasise the sense-making feedback loop in SES. Actors are part of this feedback loop and can use different means of sense-making to guide their actions. Second, the ""Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries"" and geoethical thinking are featured to highlight the relevance of actor-centric concepts. Third, Kohlberg's model of ""stages of moral adequacy"" and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) are used to show how to strengthen actor-centric virtue-ethics. Combining these lines of inquiry leads to the conclusion that ethical frameworks, civic participation and formalised guidance, when put in a mutual context, support governability and multi-actor/level policy-making.

Even fewer focus on how this political-ecological challenge is unfolding in a West African context where ocean-based e-waste trades have played a dominant role. This article engages this particular domain of blue economic critique by focusing on Ghana in general and what we shall call ""blue political ecologies of e-waste"" in particular. The article focuses on e-waste politics unfolding in and around the Korle Lagoon in Accra, Ghana. The Korle Lagoon is an urban marine space of intensive land use, toxic waste disposal, social life, and urban ecological restoration. Amidst heavy contamination, there are attempts to rehabilitate the lagoon through the Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project, an ecological science and restoration project focused on the Lagoon and its river system in the metropolitan area of Accra. It showcases the neoliberal complexities of ecological restoration. Importantly, situated in a multi-use marine environment, the project also highlights, we argue, a political ecological moment that is both about things 'blue', like water quality concerns, but also about other things non-blue such as contestation over land and housing, 'green' international NGO intervention on e-waste risk mitigation, and desires for new urban ecologies. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted between 2015 and 2018, this article contributes to blue political-ecological research and critique in Africa by asking: how do e-waste politics leak into discussions of the blue economy along the Korle Lagoon in Ghana? What are the promises and prospects of a blue political ecology of e-waste in general, and in Africa in particular? © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Maybe } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",,E-waste;Ecological restoration;Ghana;Lagoon contamination;Political ecology;Accra;Greater Accra;electronic waste;political economy;recycling;waste disposal;waste management;waste technology,,,Centering the Korle Lagoon: Exploring blue political ecologies of E-Waste in Ghana,TITLE(,Centering the Korle Lagoon: Exploring blue political ecologies of E-Waste in Ghana,TITLE(Centering the Korle Lagoon: Exploring blue political ecologies of E-Waste in Ghana) OR,,,,,

It is where the atmosphere sets the ocean in motion, climate/weather relevant air-sea processes occur and pollutants (i.e., plastic, anthropogenic carbon dioxide, radioactive/chemical waste) enter the sea. Hence, accurate estimates and forecasts of physical and biogeochemical processes at this interface are critical for sustainable blue economy planning, growth and disaster mitigation. Such estimates and forecasts rely on accurate and integrated in-situ and satellite surface observations. High-impact uses of ocean-surface observations of Essential Ocean/Climate Variables (EOVs /ECVs) include 1) assimilation into/validation of weather, ocean and climate forecast models to improve their skill, impact and value; 2) ocean physics studies (i.e., heat, momentum, freshwater and biogeochemical air-sea fluxes) to further our understanding and parameterization of air-sea processes; and 3) calibration and validation of satellite ocean products (i.e., currents, temperature, salinity, sea level, ocean color, wind, waves). We review strengths and limitations, impacts, and sustainability of in-situ ocean surface observations of several ECVs and EOVs. We draw a 10-year vision of the global ocean-surface observing network for improved synergy and integration with other observing systems (e.g., satellites), modeling/forecast efforts and for a better ocean observing governance. The context is both the applications listed above and the guidelines of frameworks such as IOC-WMO-UNEP-ICSU GOOS, GCOS, and WIGOS. Networks of multiparametric platforms, such as the global drifter array, offer opportunities for new and improved in-situ observations. Advances in sensor technology (e.g., low-cost wave sensors), high throughput communications, evolving cyberinfrastructures and data information systems with potential to improve the scope, efficiency, integration and sustainability of the ocean surface observing system are explored. © 2019 Centurioni, Turton, Lumpkin, Braasch, Brassington, Chao, Charpentier, Chen, Corlett, Dohan, Donlon, Gallage, Hormann, Ignatov, Ingleby, Jensen, Kelly-Gerreyn, Koszalka, Lin, Lindstrom, Maximenko, Merchant, Minnett, O'Carroll, Paluszkiewicz, Poli, Poulain, Reverdin, Sun, Swail, Thurston, Wu, Yu, Wang and Zhang.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Maybe }",10.3389/fmars.2019.00419,Air-sea interface;Climate variability and change;Essential climate and ocean variables;Global in situ observations;Weather Forecasting,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00419,DOI(,,,,,,,

Although the Blue Economy builds on the more familiar Green Economy, academic critique is still emerging and can be slow to translate into changes in policy and practice. What the Blue Economy means to national and local policy makers and practioners is seldom explored, and specificity is lacking on how the triple bottom line of economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social equity can be attained. This article explores these issues in one of the pioneering nations promoting the Blue Economy-the Republic of Seychelles-to establish a) how policy makers and practitioners in Seychelles perceive the Blue Economy b) what perspectives influence the concept; and c) who stands to gain or lose from its implementation. Seychelles has a unique position in Africa, due to its remote location in the Indian Ocean, its political history, and its pioneering role in promoting the Blue Economy: it presents itself as a leader for Africa in this respect. Using a combination of interviews and Q-methodology, we identify three perspectives on the Blue Economy in the country. Policymakers and practitioners are either: supportive in principle, critical in practice; pragmatic and accepting; or idealistic. These three perspectives capture the interpretations of those tasked with enacting the Blue Economy, but many of the perspectives present in international discourse are not present in the country, and indeed elements of them are met with resistance. Drawing on a social network analysis we find that the critical perspective is most influential in terms of information, both with government and non-government actors. However, the pragmatic and accepting perspective is more influential in terms of resource allocation, indicating a lack of resources could hamper actions by the actors that would like to see change. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.2458/v26i1.23102,Africa;Blue economy;Blue growth;Natural capital;Network analysis;Oceans economy;Q methodology;Seychelles;Indian Ocean;biodiversity;economic growth;green economy;marine environment;policy making;resource economy;social network;sustainability,,,10.2458/v26i1.23102,DOI(,10.2458/v26i1.23102,DOI(10.2458/v26i1.23102) OR,,,,,

In 2014, the McKinsey-designed project was formally launched by now-disgraced President Jacob Zuma with vibrant state and corporate fanfare. Financially, its most important elements were anticipated to come from corporations promoting shipping investments and port infrastructure, a new generation of offshore oil and gas extraction projects and seabed mining. However, these already conflict with underlying capitalist crisis tendencies associated with overaccumulation (overcapacity), globalization and financialization, as they played out through uneven development, commodity price volatility and excessive extraction of resources. Together this metabolic intensification of capital-nature relations can be witnessed when South Africa recently faced the Blue Economy's ecological contradictions: celebrating a massive offshore gas discovery at the same time as awareness rises about extreme coastal weather events, ocean warming and acidification (with profound threats to fast-bleaching coral reefs), sea-level rise, debilitating drought in Africa's main seaside tourist city (Cape Town), and plastic infestation of water bodies, the shoreline and vulnerable marine life. Critics of the capitalist ocean have demanded a greater state commitment to Marine Protected Areas, support for sustainable subsistence fishing and eco-tourism. But they are losing, and so more powerful resistance is needed, focusing on shifting towards post-fossil energy and transport infrastructure, agriculture and spatial planning. Given how climate change has become devastating to vulnerable coastlines-such as central Mozambique's, victim of two of the Southern Hemisphere's most intense cyclones in March-April 2019-it is essential to better link ocean defence mechanisms to climate activism: global youth Climate Strikes and the direct action approach adopted by the likes of Dakota Access Pipe Line resistance in the US, Extinction Rebellion in Britain, and Ende Gelande in Germany. Today, as the limits to capital's crisis-displacement tactics are becoming more evident, it is the interplay of these top-down and bottom-up processes that will shape the future Blue Economy narrative, giving it either renewed legitimacy, or the kind of illegitimacy already experienced in so much South African resource-centric capitalism. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.2458/v26i1.23504,Blue economy;Capitalist crisis;Oceans phakisa;Resistance;South Africa;Anthozoa;Zuma;action plan;bottom-up approach;capitalism;environmental economics;environmental impact;infrastructural development;investment;marine resource;port operation;shipping;sustainability;top-down approach;uneven development;vulnerability;Africa,,,10.2458/v26i1.23504,DOI(,10.2458/v26i1.23504,DOI(10.2458/v26i1.23504) OR,,,,,

The Banda Sea is important deep-sea ecosystem in Indonesia and it was identified as a global marine mega-biodiversity site. The objectives of this paper are 1) to document the history, achievements, and challenges of deep-sea research development and 2) to develop a grand design and innovative strategic plan for deep-sea research. Literature reviews and questionnaire survey for scientists across Indonesia were carried out. The literature reviews indicated that deep-sea ecosystem is not well documented. Few articles on deep-sea were published (mean 0.8 article y-1) which were mainly focused on geological (45%) and physical oceanography (32%), less research on biological (16%) and chemical oceanography (8%). Deep-sea ecosystem faced tremendous threats due to ecosystem degradation, pollution, and climate change. The questionnaire survey showed that research infrastructure/facilities (Ranking 1) and institutional management systems (Ranking 2) were the main obstacles to Indonesian deep-sea research development. A grand design named Indonesian Deep-sea Research and Monitoring (I-DREAM) and its strategic plan were developed to achieve blue economy goals. Strengthening research infrastructure and institutional management systems are the top priories that should be achieved in the short-term period to support deep-sea research in Indonesia. Scientific pursuit in long-term period should be focused on biodiversity and deep-sea ecology including chemical oceanography (24%) and its interaction with other ecosystems and atmosphere (18%) were identified as the top priorities to be implemented for future research (Ranking 1 and 2). The Banda Sea was identified as a suitable core study area of the I-DREAM's pilot project. The grand-design and its innovative strategic plan are essential to fulfilling high demand on a guideline for deep-sea research to achieve blue economic development goals. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

To meet this challenge, MSP approaches and tools have evolved globally, from local to national scales. At two International Marine Conservation Congresses (2016 and 2018), MSP practitioners and researchers from diverse geographic, technical and socio-economic contexts met to share advances in practical approaches and spatial tools to achieve multi-objective MSP. Here we share the lessons learned and commonalities that emerged from studies conducted in Belize, Canada, South Africa, Seychelles, the United Kingdom and the United States on a number of topics related to advancing MSP. We identify seven important themes that we believe are broadly relevant to any multi-objective MSP process: (1) indigenous and local knowledge should inform planning goals and objectives; (2) transparent and evidence-based approaches can reduce user conflict; (3) simple ecosystem service models and scenarios can facilitate multi-objective planning; (4) trade-off analyses can help balance diverse objectives; (5) ecosystem services may assist planning for high value-data poor Blue Economy sectors; (6) game theoretic decision rules can help to deliver fair, equitable and win-win spatial allocation solutions; and (7) strategic mapping products can facilitate decision making amongst stakeholders from different sectors. Some of these themes are evident in MSP processes that have been completed in the previous decade, but the fast-evolving field of MSP is addressing increasingly more complex objectives, and practitioners need to respond with practical approaches and spatial tools that can address this complexity. © 2019 Lombard, Ban, Smith, Lester, Sink, Wood, Jacob, Kyriazi, Tingey and Sims.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Maybe }",10.3389/fmars.2019.00166,Decision support;Ecosystem services;Integrated ocean management;Marine conservation;Ocean zoning;Scenario planning;Trade-offs;Military Personnel,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00166,DOI(,,,,,,,

Expanding the above-mentioned industries towards this new frontier can help to respond to two of the main challenges facing mankind: the sustainable, safe, and reliable production of energy and food, driven by an increasing population and rising prosperity.

Integrating disparate datasets (including old and new knowledge) is a challenge for any location, but is increasingly important given the expansion of the marine industries constituting the blue economy. This is particularly so when industries operate in frontier, or remote regions with high conservation significance. Ecosystem models are an integration tool that can give insight into the structure and function of marine systems and act as a testbed for exploring scenarios of development for the region. Two of the most widely used ecosystem models (Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim) were implemented for the GAB, to allow an exploration of development scenarios and to provide tools in support of future management of the GAB's socio-ecological systems. The models were used to evaluate the vulnerability of key species, food webs, habitats and animal groupings to ecosystem stressors such as climate change, fisheries, disease, changing spatial management, aquaculture and oil spills. The models’ responses to cessation of fishing indicate that the anthropogenic signature is not ‘untouched’ but is not yet substantially degraded. The complexity and confined area of much of the natural and anthropogenic activity in the region, which is highly concentrated in the gulfs and along the shoreline, means the system is sufficiently interlinked for cumulative nonlinear outcomes to occur if the system is sufficiently stressed. Scenarios of increased fishing pressure had the greatest impacts on individual functional groups, while scenarios of ocean warming had the greatest influence on ecosystem structure and integrity. Oil spill scenarios (e.g. caused by potential off-shore shipping accidents) had potential impacts on seabirds, pelagic fishes and marine mammals, with flow-on effects to the whole ecosystem, but only in a confined area immediately around the incident's footprint. These results give scientists and managers insights into how expanding the blue economy could impact ecosystem services and the societies currently dependent on them. This work also provides a set of tools for the GAB that can act as a launch point for systems analysis and can facilitate future assessments or planning for the region. © 2018",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1016/j.dsr2.2018.11.002,Ecosystem indicators;End-to-end model;Environmental assessment;Food web models;Model comparison;Scenario analysis;Strategic management;Great Australian Bight;Indian Ocean;Animalia;Mammalia;Pisces;Climate change;Climate models;Fisheries;Fishing (oil wells);Industrial economics;Mammals;Marine industry;Marine pollution;Oil spills;Oils and fats;Petroleum prospecting;Systems analysis;End-to-end models;Food web model;bioindicator;ecosystem modeling;environmental assessment;food web;future prospect;human activity;integrated approach;model validation;oil spill;pelagic environment;scenario analysis;vulnerability;Ecosystems,,,10.1016/j.dsr2.2018.11.002,DOI(,,,,,,,

The concept seeks to marry ocean-based development opportunities with environmental stewardship and protection. Yet different actors are co-opting this term in competing, and often conflicting ways. Four conceptual interpretations of the Blue Economy are identified, through examination of dominant discourses within international Blue Economy policy documents and key ‘grey’ literature. The way the Blue Economy is enacted is also examined, through an analysis of the Blue Economy ‘in practice’, and the actors involved. Finally, the scope of the Blue Economy is explored, with a particular focus on which particular marine industries are included or excluded from different conceptualizations. This analysis reveals areas of both consensus and conflict. Areas of consensus reflect the growing trend towards commodification and valuation of nature, the designation and delimitation of spatial boundaries in the oceans and increasing securitization of the world's oceans. Areas of conflict exist most notably around a divergence in opinions over the legitimacy of individual sectors as components of the ‘Blue Economy’, in particular, carbon-intensive industries like oil and gas, and the emerging industry of deep seabed mining. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 157 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1080/1523908X.2018.1473153,Blue Economy;Blue Growth;oceans governance;Sustainable Development Goals,,,10.1080/1523908X.2018.1473153,DOI(,10.1080/1523908X.2018.1473153,DOI(10.1080/1523908X.2018.1473153) OR,,,,,

However, little is known about the meaning of sustainability and the status of its implementation by corporations invested in the maritime economy. The present paper addresses this gap. Drawing on the discourse theory of Laclau and Mouffe (2001 [1985]), the study explores the discourse on corporate sustainability. It was found that of 396 surveyed companies only 61 provide commitments to and reporting on the issue of sustainability. A detailed analysis of these companies showed that there has been a shift from a voluntary to a mandatory commitment to the concept as a direct consequence of being exposed to massive pressures to meet the expectations of their employees, customers and shareholders to prevent any harm to the environment, to save resources, and follow international regulations. It is argued that Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory provides an approach to help to explain the practice of corporations in re-framing these challenges as an entrepreneurial opportunity to save costs, i.e. by avoiding fines, lawsuits, and clean-up costs, to optimize efficiency in all business sectors, to stay competitive, and to gain a better public image. The paper concludes that it is likely that the current efforts of companies with regard to the anticipated increases in the exploitation of marine resources will not be sufficient to preserve ocean health in the long run.

Realistic assessments of impact must consider the cumulative impacts of multiple, coincident threats and the differing vulnerabilities of ecosystems to these threats. Expert knowledge is often used to assess impact in marine ecosystems because empirical data are lacking; however, this introduces uncertainty into the results. As part of a spatial cumulative impact assessment for Spencer Gulf, South Australia, we asked experts to estimate score ranges (best-case, most-likely and worst-case), which accounted for their uncertainty about the effect of 32 threats on eight ecosystems. Expert scores were combined with data on the spatial pattern and intensity of threats to generate cumulative impact maps based on each of the three scoring scenarios, as well as simulations and maps of uncertainty. We compared our method, which explicitly accounts for the experts' knowledge-based uncertainty, with other approaches and found that it provides smaller uncertainty bounds, leading to more constrained assessment results. Collecting these additional data on experts' knowledge-based uncertainty provides transparency and simplifies interpretation of the outputs from spatial cumulative impact assessments, facilitating their application for sustainable resource management and conservation. © 2018 The Author(s).",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1038/s41598-018-19354-6,article;controlled study;ecosystem;human;resource management;simulation;South Australia;uncertainty,,,10.1038/s41598-018-19354-6,DOI(,,,,,,,

As a result, conservation and resource management increasingly look to factor in potential interactions among the social, ecological and economic components of these systems. Investigation of these interactions requires interdisciplinary frameworks that incorporate methods and insights from across the social and biophysical sciences. Risk assessment methods, which have been developed across numerous disciplines and applied to various real-world settings and problems, provide a unique connection point for cross-disciplinary engagement. However, research on risk is often conducted in distinct spheres by experts whose focus is on narrow sources or outcomes of risk. Movement toward a more integrated treatment of risk to ensure a balanced approach to developing and managing ocean resources requires cross-disciplinary engagement and understanding. Here, we provide a primer on risk assessment intended to encourage the development and implementation of integrated risk assessment processes in the emerging blue economy. First, we summarize the dominant framework for risk in the ecological/biophysical sciences. Then, we discuss six key insights from the long history of risk research in the social sciences that can inform integrated assessments of risk: (1) consider the subjective nature of risk, (2) understand individual social and cultural influences on risk perceptions, (3) include diverse expertise, (4) consider the social scales of analysis, (5) incorporate quantitative and qualitative approaches, and (6) understand interactions and feedbacks within systems. Finally, we show how these insights can be incorporated into risk assessment and management, and apply them to a case study of whale entanglements in fishing gear off the United States west coast. © 2019 Hodgson, Essington, Samhouri, Allison, Bennett, Bostrom, Cullen, Kasperski, Levin and Poe.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2019.00609,Blue economy;Ecosystem management;Risk analysis;Risk management;Social-ecological systems;Sustainability science;Risk Assessment,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00609,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2019.00609,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.00609) OR,,,,,

However, mechanistic understanding of the contribution of microbial symbionts to the chemical diversity of octocorals is yet to be achieved. This review inventories the natural products so-far described for octocoral-derived bacteria and fungi, uncovering a true chemical arsenal of terpenes, steroids, alkaloids, and polyketides with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antifouling, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial activities of enormous potential for blue growth. Genome mining of 15 bacterial associates (spanning 12 genera) cultivated from Eunicella spp. resulted in the identification of 440 putative and classifiable secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), encompassing varied terpene-, polyketide-, bacteriocin-, and nonribosomal peptide-synthase BGCs. This points towards a widespread yet uncharted capacity of octocoral-associated bacteria to synthetize a broad range of natural products. However, to extend our knowledge and foster the near-future laboratory production of bioactive compounds from (cultivatable and currently uncultivatable) octocoral symbionts, optimal blending between targeted metagenomics, DNA recombinant technologies, improved symbiont cultivation, functional genomics, and analytical chemistry are required.

As exemplified by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, it has a tremendous potential for innovation and growth in blue economy sectors. Due to the inherent complexity of the natural system, the answers to many scientific and societal questions are unknown, and the impacts of the cumulative stresses imposed by anthropogenic pressures (such as pollution) and climate change are difficult to assess and forecast. A major challenge for the scientific community making observations of the coastal marine environment is to integrate observations of Essential Ocean Variables for physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes on appropriate spatial and temporal scales, and in a sustained and scientifically based manner. Coastal observations are important for improving our understanding of the complex biotic and abiotic processes in many fields of research such as ecosystem science, habitat protection, and climate change impacts. They are also important for improving our understanding of the impacts of human activities such as fishing and aquaculture, and underpin risk monitoring and assessment. The observations enable us to better understand ecosystems and the societal consequences of overfishing, disease (particularly shellfish), loss of biodiversity, coastline withdrawal, and ocean acidification, amongst others. The European coastal observing infrastructure JERICO-RI, has gathered and organized key communities embracing new technologies and providing a future strategy, with recommendations on the way forward and on governance. Particularly, the JERICO community acknowledges that the main providers of coastal observations are: (1) research infrastructures, (2) national monitoring programs, and (3) monitoring activities performed by marine industries. The scope of this paper is to present some key elements of our coastal science strategy to build it on long term. It describes how the pan-European JERICO community is building an integrated and innovation-driven coastal research infrastructure for Europe. The RI embraces emerging technologies which will revolutionize the way the ocean is observed. Developments in biotechnology (molecular and optical sensors, omics-based biology) will soon provide direct and online access to chemical and biological variables including in situ quantification of harmful algae and contaminants. Using artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things will soon provide operational platforms and autonomous and remotely operated smart sensors. Embracing key technologies, high quality open access data, modeling and satellite observations, it will support sustainable blue growth, warning and forecasting coastal services and healthy marine ecosystem.

This paper seeks to examine how cost-effective, modern and advanced small satellites can play a pivotal role in earth observation and contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals in Africa. It focuses on the economic benefits of data derived from small satellites deployed in earth observation missions to developing countries in Africa in monitoring food security, water resources, and wind patterns for clean energy generation using wind turbines, human settlements, land use, climate change, blue economy, air quality, and the environment. It then highlights a case study of South Africa, a country that has remarkably adopted small satellite technology to advance its development agenda. Lastly, it provides a policy framework that is needed to ensure small satellite programs for earth observation missions become successful in Africa.

The sector is particularly important in the Mediterranean Sea which, despite covering less than 1% of the world’s oceans, carries about 15% of global shipping. Worldwide, ocean-related economic activity – the so-called Blue Economy – is growing; and the maritime transport sector is expected to continue increasing at a rate of 4% per annum for the next decade. In line with the global expansion of seaborne trade, shipping activity in the Mediterranean is growing in terms of the number of routes, traffic intensity and size of ships. And with this growth come increasing environmental impacts, such as chemical pollution, noise pollution and collisions with marine mammals. These environmental impacts are an issue for the whole of the Mediterranean, but it’s particularly critical that they’re prevented – or at least minimized – in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which by definition are areas of great importance for marine biodiversity and ecosystems. In certain sensitive MPAs, maritime transport of any kind is forbidden. In many, though, shipping activity is legally possible, so there’s an urgent need for all relevant stakeholders to work together to ensure sustainable transport practices and tools are identified and adopted to minimize its impact. Considering the growth of the sector, it’s inevitable that major commercial traffic routes will increasingly interact with MPAs and other area-based conservation measures in some Mediterranean locations, especially where vessels are approaching ports or passing through straits. This paper provides key recommendations for the main actors in the maritime transport sector to help move towards a sustainable Mediterranean Blue Economy. The three stakeholder groups we focus on are MPA managers, public authorities and maritime transport companies. Each group has its own priorities, perspectives and powers, but all can make important contributions to a sustainable future for the region. © 2019 WIT Press.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Shipping,positive,Tier 1 (BE)",10.2495/DNE-V14-N4-264-274,Biodiversity;Blue economy;Conservation;Ecosystems;Environmental impacts;Marine protected areas;Maritime transport;Shipping;Economics;Environmental impact;Environmental protection;Freight transportation;Mammals;Noise pollution;Ships;Sustainable development;Blue economies;Conservation measures;Economic activities;Marine biodiversity;Marine protected area;Shipping activities;Sustainable transport;Marine pollution;Military Personnel,,,10.2495/DNE-V14-N4-264-274,DOI(,10.2495/DNE-V14-N4-264-274,DOI(10.2495/DNE-V14-N4-264-274) OR,,,,,

The goal of the community paper will be achieved by bringing together oceanographers, data scientists and marine stakeholders to develop an NZ-OOS that provides best knowledge and tools to the sectors of society that use or are influenced by the ocean. © 2019 O'Callaghan, Stevens, Roughan, Cornelisen, Sutton, Garrett, Giorli, Smith, Currie, Suanda, Williams, Bowen, Fernandez, Vennell, Knight, Barter, McComb, Oliver, Livingston, Tellier, Meissner, Brewer, Gall, Nodder, Decima, Souza, Forcén-Vazquez, Gardiner, Paul-Burke, Chiswell, Roberts, Hayden, Biggs and Macdonald.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Maybe } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3389/fmars.2019.00143,Changing ocean climate;Marine community;Mātauranga Māori;Ocean modeling;Ocean observation network;New Zealand,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00143,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2019.00143,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.00143) OR,,,,,

As blue research expands with the world increasingly understanding its importance, policy makers and research institutions worldwide concerned with ocean and coastal regions are demanding further and improved analysis of the Blue Economy. Particularly, in terms of the management connotation, data access, monitoring, and product development, countries are making decisions according to their own needs. As a consequence of this lack of consensus, further dialogue including this cases analysis of the blue economy is even more necessary. This paper consists of four chapters: (I) Understanding the concept of Blue Economy, (II) Defining Blue economy theoretical cases, (III) Introducing Blue economy application cases and (IV) Providing an outlook for the future. Chapters (II) and (III) summarizes all the case studies into nine aspects, each aiming to represent different aspects of the blue economy. This paper is a result of knowledge and experience collected from across the global ocean observing community, and is only made possible with encouragement, support and help of all members. Despite the blue economy being a relatively new concept, we have demonstrated our promising exploration in a number of areas. We put forward proposals for the development of the blue economy, including shouldering global responsibilities to protect marine ecological environment, strengthening international communication and sharing development achievements, and promoting the establishment of global blue partnerships. However, there is clearly much room for further development in terms of the scope and depth of our collective understanding and analysis. © 2019 Wenhai, Cusack, Baker, Tao, Mingbao, Paige, Xiaofan, Levin, Escobar, Amon, Yue, Reitz, Neves, O'Rourke, Mannarini, Pearlman, Tinker, Horsburgh, Lehodey, Pouliquen, Dale, Peng and Yufeng.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.3389/fmars.2019.00261,Blue economy;Data analysis and information delivery;Deep ocean stewardship;Ecological restoration;Macro-economic control policies;Science-based products,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00261,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2019.00261,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.00261) OR,,,,,

High-profile dialogue and policy decisions on the future of the ocean are informed largely by economic and ecological research. Key insights from the social sciences raise concerns for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and social justice, but these have yet to gain traction with investors and the policy discourse on transforming ocean governance. The largest group of ocean-users - women and men who service, fish and trade from small-scale fisheries (SSF) - argue that they have been marginalized from the dialogue between international environmental and economic actors that is determining strategies for the future of the ocean. Blue Economy or Blue Growth initiatives see the ocean as the new economic frontier and imply an alignment with social objectives and SSF concerns. Deeper analysis reveals fundamental differences in ideologies, priorities and approaches. We argue that SSF are being subtly and overtly squeezed for geographic, political and economic space by larger scale economic and environmental conservation interests, jeopardizing the substantial benefits SSF provide through the livelihoods of millions of women and men, for the food security of around four billion consumers globally, and in the developing world, as a key source of micro-nutrients and protein for over a billion low-income consumers.

At that time, Japan was not only changing political systems drastically but also integrating the Western Great Powers' advanced science and technology positively. As a result, in the days of World War I, Japan achieved entering permanent member of the League of Nations and came to occupy a big position globally. Although Japan was put under the control of allied powers, after the World War II, Japan planed integrating the overseas advanced technology again and will have current prosperity in one's hand afterwards. On the other hand, when we pay more attention abroad, the utilization of science and technology is essential to the right profit in the achievement of 'Sustainable Development Goals' that is an action plan shown in 'Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development' adopted in the United Nations General Assembly of September 2015, In Japan, 3rd Basic Plan on Ocean Policy approved by the Cabinet in May 2018 prescribes about promoting measures such as 'Improve scientific knowledge', 'Promote Arctic policy' and others based on science and technology.

Container offloading ports and logistic storage yards must optimise throughput while maintaining operational safety as paramount. Empty and full containers are stacked to maximum heights, for best utilisation of available land, and this creates new safety challenges when facing high wind and weather scenarios. In the context of the Blue Economy, the need to monitor high winds, and have an efficient process of informing labour in adverse events, is important in maintaining safety and productivity. Cranes used for vessel offloading have automatic intervention to stop work. Container storage yards and logistic terminals do not, and therefore require several alarms systems and other means of communication to ensure internal and external staff can be trained to respond according to a safety plan. There are many methods of high wind detection, data retention, and alarm management available. It is my purpose to explain the various systems to choose from and how they can be designed to meet differing operation requirements.

As one of the active members, Indonesia has become quite vocal in promoting the main vision of the association, which is the vision of a global blue economy. Proved by the latest IORA summit in 2017, Indonesia was trusted to be the host for the event. This is of no surprise given Indonesia is eager to achieve the blue economy itself by making the strategic maritime policy called the ""Global Maritime Fulcrum"". However, the problem is why Indonesia seems to choose IORA over other associations, for instance ASEAN even though ASEAN also has the rather similar policy called ""ASEAN Master Plan Connectivity"". The other question is how significant the cooperation really is. This research will use the qualitative method with an analysis-oriented writing, based on two basic theories which are neoliberal institutionalism and geopolitics. The conclusion of this research is that a state's interest determines how its foreign policy is made, in this case, from a geopolitics perspective. Indonesia's interest in achieving the ""Global Maritime Fulcrum"" vision is considered the main goal of the country, and that is why Indonesia has been active in the cooperation; which has the most beneficial offer. Furthermore, like the neoliberal institutionalists say, an international association is supposed to help the members gain interest though strategic cooperation. This topic is a new and important issue as the global maritime fulcrum has become crucial for the future of Indonesia's maritime diplomacy. It can also be the reference for future research related to a similar topic. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Included }",,Geopolitics;Global maritime fulcrum;IORA;Neoliberal institutionalism,,,The significance of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Indonesia's Global Maritime Fulcrum vision,TITLE(,,,,,,,

DSM is still predominantly in the planning stage and will face some unique challenges but there is considerable environmental management experience in existing related industries. International good practice has been suggested for DSM by bodies such as the Pacific Community and the International Marine Minerals Society. The inherent uncertainty in DSM presents challenges, but it can be addressed by collection of environmental information, area-based/spatial management, the precautionary approach and adaptive management. Tools exist for regional and strategic management, which have already begun to be introduced by the International Seabed Authority, for example in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

Data must be of sufficient quality to meet the specific users' needs. It must also be accessible in a timely manner. And yet, despite being critical, this timely access to known-quality data proves challenging. Europe's marine data have traditionally been collected by a myriad of entities with the result that much of our data are scattered throughout unconnected databases and repositories. Even when data are available, they are often not compatible, making the sharing of the information and data aggregation particularly challenging. In this paper, we present how the European Marine Observation and Data network (EMODnet) has developed over the last decade to tackle these issues. Today, EMODnet is comprised of more than 150 organizations which gather marine data, metadata, and data products and make them more easily accessible for a wider range of users. EMODnet currently consists of seven sub-portals: bathymetry, geology, physics, chemistry, biology, seabed habitats, and human activities. In addition, Sea-basin Checkpoints have been established to assess the observation capacity in the North Sea, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Baltic, Artic, and Black Sea. The Checkpoints identify whether the observation infrastructure in Europe meets the needs of users by undertaking a number of challenges. To complement this, a Data Ingestion Service has been set up to tackle the problem of the wealth of marine data that remain unavailable, by reaching out to data holders, explaining the benefits of sharing their data and offering a support service to assist them in releasing their data and making them available through EMODnet. The EMODnet Central Portal (www.emodnet.eu) provides a single point of access to these services, which are free to access and use. The strategic vision of EMODnet in the next decade is also presented, together with key focal areas toward a more user-oriented service, including EMODnet for business, internationalization for global users, and stakeholder engagement to connect the diverse communities across the marine knowledge value chain. © 2019 Martín Míguez, Novellino, Vinci, Claus, Calewaert, Vallius, Schmitt, Pititto, Giorgetti, Askew, Iona, Schaap, Pinardi, Harpham, Kater, Populus, She, Palazov, McMeel, Oset, Lear, Manzella, Gorringe, Simoncelli, Larkin, Holdsworth, Arvanitidis, Molina Jack, Chaves Montero, Herman and Hernandez.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded ,  Basil  => Excluded }",10.3389/fmars.2019.00313,Blue economy;Checkpoint;Data integrator;Data portal;Data services;EMODnet;Marine knowledge;Open access;Europe;Military Personnel,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00313,DOI(,,,,,,,

While this region varies in human population density, GDP and wealth, coral reefs, and their associated ecosystem services, are central to people's livelihoods. Unfortunately, the region's reefs have experienced extensive degradation over the last several decades. This degradation has been attributed to a combination of disease, overfishing, and multiple pressures from other human activities. Furthermore, the Caribbean region has experienced rapid ocean warming and acidification as a result of climate change that will continue and accelerate throughout the 21st century. It is evident that these changes will pose increasing threats to Caribbean reefs unless imminent actions are taken at the local, regional and global scale. Active management is required to sustain Caribbean reefs and increase their resilience to recover from acute stress events. Here, we propose local and regional solutions to halt and reverse Caribbean coral reef degradation under ongoing ocean warming and acidification. Because the Caribbean has already experienced high coral reef degradation, we suggest that this region may be suitable for more aggressive interventions that might not be suitable for other regions. Solutions with direct ecological benefits highlighted here build on existing knowledge of factors that can contribute to reef restoration and increased resilience in the Caribbean: (1)management of water quality, (2)reduction of unsustainable fishing practices, (3)application of ecological engineering, and (4)implementing marine spatial planning. Complementary socioeconomic and governance solutions include: (1)increasing communication and leveraging resources through the establishment of a regional reef secretariat, (2)incorporating reef health and sustainability goals into the blue economy plans for the region, and (3)initiating a reef labeling program to incentivize corporate partnerships for reef restoration and protection to sustain overall reef health in the region. © 2019 The Authors","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.rsma.2019.100677,Caribbean;Climate change;Coral reef;Ecosystem services;Ocean acidification;Restoration;Caribbean Region,,,10.1016/j.rsma.2019.100677,DOI(,10.1016/j.rsma.2019.100677,DOI(10.1016/j.rsma.2019.100677) OR,,,,,

Morphometric characteristics of 913 spider crabs collected in 2016 within the Gulf of Gabès in Tunisia were examined. A sexual dimorphism was observed concerning the body, chelar propodus and abdomen form and sizes. Crab’s carapace width ranged from 22.7 to 89.1 mm and from 4.02 to 74.5 mm, for males and females, respectively. The sex ratio was male biased (M: F = 1: 0.92). Local Ecological Knowledge surveys revealed a decline in fishermen’s income of 72% due to crab invasion (damages of fishing nets and catches, decrease of working days and catch yield). Socio-economic impacts of Libinia dubia can be reverted into profits by using crab exoskeleton (shells) for feeding and for bioactive molecules extraction. They are mainly composed of ash (71% of the dry weight dw), chitin (from 14.66% to 15.13% dw), crude proteins (11%) and fats (between 0.49% and 0.86%) with no sex difference for all studied parameters (p > 0.05).

However, in the port city of Durban, subsistence fishing has formed an important component of both the livelihood and identity of individuals living in marginalized communities adjacent to the harbor for over a century. However, since America's 9/11 terrorist attacks a number of new international laws and regulations have shaped local legislation and policies which seek to exclude the public from accessing the harbor area. As a consequence, increased security measures have contributed to an increasingly closed off space, where increased barriers to access have effectively isolated the harbor from the surrounding city, and restricted entry to local fishers. As a result, fisherfolk have been forced to contest their exclusion from the harbor, risking expulsion or arrest to continue practicing their livelihoods. Utilizing a political ecology framework, and integrating perspectives drawn from over a decade of qualitative fieldwork, this article explores how securitization narratives operate as a tool for the neoliberal exclusion of the poor from public space. Analysis suggests that the securitization of Durban's harbor has served to bar entry to the poor towards participating in South Africa's blue economy, while allowing elites exclusive access to marine resources. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.2458/v26i1.23008,Blue economy;Indian Ocean;Neoliberalism;Public space;Securitization;South Africa;Subsistence fishing;Durban;KwaZulu-Natal;economic growth;environmental politics;fishery management;fishing;livelihood;marine environment;resource management;Military Personnel,,,10.2458/v26i1.23008,DOI(,10.2458/v26i1.23008,DOI(10.2458/v26i1.23008) OR,,,,,

Although in all parts of the world the sea has traditionally been the driver for the growing economy, research on the economic value of the blue economy has been limited. However, when MSP is becoming the norm, evaluating the existing blue economy becomes more important. In this paper, the economic significance of blue economies is estimated for the Gulf of Bothnia (GoB) region of Finland. By conducting a case study on the current situation of the blue economy in a specific region it is possible to bring the discussion of blue growth to a practical and local level. The GoB was seen as a potential area to study blue growth or the blue economy because of the already existing active maritime sector and the relatively pristine environment.

Semi-structured interviews (n = 30) with decision-makers, policy advisors, scholars, and community elders were conducted in multiple sites to scrutinise the politics that frame the country's environmental predicament. Findings indicate that: (1) irrespective of considerable scientific uncertainties and data inconsistencies, previous governments have fervently abided by a ‘sinking nation paradigm’ unreasonably constraining political visions of the nation's future; (2) consequentially, ‘adaptation’ has become a metaphor for economic development conceptions, which are tied to mounting budgetary requirements; (3) climate aid is sought for adaptation initiatives irrespective of the needs and desires of island communities; (4) incentives to develop a blue-green economy have facilitated the emergence of highly problematic deep-sea mineral (DSM) initiatives, which this study regards as precursors to seabed grabbing. The paper, therefore, posits that marine policy makers in Kiribati – and other small-island developing states (SIDS) – need to be more vigilant to wider political economic agendas when considering options for ocean and coastal governance.

However, it has been conceptualized in various ways and examined via different research methodologies, resulting in distinct paradigms in different sub-disciplines. This study specifically analyzes various ways in which the idea of space has been perceived in all sub-disciplines in Earth sciences and the corresponding research paradigms. This paper pays particular attention to how space could be conceptualized in Marine Science and comes up with several suggestions about improving the understanding and research paradigms of it. Space not only is the platform where a wide range of non-human activities take place, but also has some social, political, and economic meaning. In this sense, space in the Marine Science should have a dual nature. As it is widely acknowledged that marine space is mainly treated as the site where natural processes happen, including physical, chemical and biological processes, and this emphasizes the objectivity of it. Apart from that, this paper also believes that marine economy, industry, politics resource, and so on, are the typical examples to explain marine space as a process element, mainly showing its sociality, since all these activities have profound interactions with human, such as ocean economic zones, the Blue Economy, coordination of land and marine economy, and so on and so forth. On account of different attributes mentioned above, Marine Science adapts both quantitative and qualitative methods of empirical and systematical paradigms to analyzing specific problems. Furthermore, boundaries have been more and more indistinct nowadays and it is necessary to use more than one paradigm to explain a particular attribute of space, meaning that those paradigms need to be combined to study a particular aspect of space, thereby blurring the boundaries among them. For example, analyzing the objectivity of marine space regularly requires quantitative methods of empirical paradigm. However, interactions of natural processes in different locations, or natural procedures and human rely on qualitative methods of empirical paradigm. Besides, considering marine space as a social process element requires qualitative methods first to identify the social significance, and then to apply quantitative methods to solve certain problems. In order to improve concepts, attributes and paradigms of space in Marine Science, this study comes up with several prospects. First of all, there are still some methods that can be used to explore the objectivity of marine space, including promoting spatial-temporal detection, majorly focusing on improving the observation and the ability to exploit the deep sea. Secondly, it shows the importance of studying the sociality by applying both quantitative and qualitative methods of empirical and systematical paradigms, for instance, by paying more attention to marine climate and the interaction between the ocean and other spheres on earth and studying the land and the sea from a coordinating perspective. Next, technological breakthroughs are needed since they can make sure all the suggestions mentioned above can be fulfilled. Finally, considering that geography has already done some researches on the symbolic meaning of space, Marine Science can also explore this field to enrich the concepts of space in its own discipline. In the end, this study also offers some policy suggestions for improving comprehensive research abilities for marine science based on space from a view of national strategy. In the first place, it is necessary to assemble different panels of experts, laboratories and research funds on a national level to strategically guide the development of Marine Science. Then, we show that promoting the participation in international research projects to acquire advanced concepts and methods can improve our understanding of Marine Science.

The current study reports fisheries output using ICT at major landing sites and markets in Kenya and Uganda from the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) Enhanced Fish Market Information Service (EFMIS) database for 2009 – 2017. Catch assessment survey data validated the use of market data in drawing conclusions. Regional Frame Survey data provided information before EFMIS, enabling comparisons of fish trade costings. The average quantity of fish traded in Kenya depended on seasons of active lake fishing, which occurs in January – March and August – October, while Uganda had an irregular pattern associated with fish trade throughout the year. The quantity of fish traded weekly depended on the average price of fish. Lower sales margins during the EFMIS project showed the merits of information sharing using ICT platforms for efficient and equitable fish trade.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used analytical quantitative approaches to assess the impact of marine production manufacturing on GDP between GCC countries over the period from 2007 to 2015. The data were collected from Global Competitiveness Reports during 2006-2016 and from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO 2015 reports. Findings: The results show that Saudi Arabia country has the highest production of marine while Bahrain country is the lowest in GCC. The results of ordinary least squares test show that marine production has a statistical significance on GDP indicators as Pearson correlation matrix shows a strong relationship between all variables. Practical implications: The main conclusion is that GCC countries must adopt a regional strategy to support maritime activities, especially in the light of green environmental fluctuations. Integrated management plans are also needed to protect vital coastal ecosystems while allowing economic growth and ensuring a better quality of life for all coastal populations. Comprehensive and collaborative leadership provides effective long-term management of coastal ecosystems in the GCC. In addition, GCC countries have high competition with each other for their market share in the global export-based marine production manufacturing.

Over 150 years of exploration has revealed that this dynamic system provides critical climate regulation, houses a wealth of energy, mineral, and biological resources, and represents a vast repository of biological diversity. A long history of deep-ocean exploration and observation led to the initial concept for the Deep-Ocean Observing Strategy (DOOS), under the auspices of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). Here we discuss the scientific need for globally integrated deep-ocean observing, its status, and the key scientific questions and societal mandates driving observing requirements over the next decade. We consider the Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) needed to address deep-ocean challenges within the physical, biogeochemical, and biological/ecosystem sciences according to the Framework for Ocean Observing (FOO), and map these onto scientific questions. Opportunities for new and expanded synergies among deep-ocean stakeholders are discussed, including academic-industry partnerships with the oil and gas, mining, cable and fishing industries, the ocean exploration and mapping community, and biodiversity conservation initiatives. Future deep-ocean observing will benefit from the greater integration across traditional disciplines and sectors, achieved through demonstration projects and facilitated reuse and repurposing of existing deep-sea data efforts. We highlight examples of existing and emerging deep-sea methods and technologies, noting key challenges associated with data volume, preservation, standardization, and accessibility. Emerging technologies relevant to deep-ocean sustainability and the blue economy include novel genomics approaches, imaging technologies, and ultra-deep hydrographic measurements. Capacity building will be necessary to integrate capabilities into programs and projects at a global scale. Progress can be facilitated by Open Science and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles and converge on agreed to data standards, practices, vocabularies, and registries. We envision expansion of the deep-ocean observing community to embrace the participation of academia, industry, NGOs, national governments, international governmental organizations, and the public at large in order to unlock critical knowledge contained in the deep ocean over coming decades, and to realize the mutual benefits of thoughtful deep-ocean observing for all elements of a sustainable ocean. © 2019 Levin, Bett, Gates, Heimbach, Howe, Janssen, McCurdy, Ruhl, Snelgrove, Stocks, Bailey, Baumann-Pickering, Beaverson, Benfield, Booth, Carreiro-Silva, Colaço, Eblé, Fowler, Gjerde, Jones, Katsumata, Kelley, Le Bris, Leonardi, Lejzerowicz, Macreadie, McLean, Meitz, Morato, Netburn, Pawlowski, Smith, Sun, Uchida, Vardaro, Venkatesan and Weller.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 116 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.3389/fmars.2019.241,Biodiversity;Blue economy;Deep sea;Essential ocean variables;Ocean observation;Ocean sensors,,,10.3389/fmars.2019.241,DOI(,10.3389/fmars.2019.241,DOI(10.3389/fmars.2019.241) OR,,,,,

To do so, it firstly analyses how the concept of blue economy is interpreted in the regional context, and secondly, it considers the anticipated impacts of blue economy onto other policy priorities, in particular, that of enhanced regional cooperation. The blue economy notion is expected to reinvigorate the discussions on sustainable development in the region and have a harmonising effect on regulation and governance amongst the states. It is also expected to have an incentivising effect on commercial and research ventures, including capacity building of the region’s human capital. However, blue economy and its associated financing, institutional setting and the focus on innovation are unlikely to change the course of improving co-ownership.

As marine industries expand, spatial interconnections and industry boundaries are being drawn and the potential for the combined use of marine space is being explored. The aim of this paper is to provide a single source document that summarizes the probable boundaries of marine growth industries, namely aquaculture; offshore wind energy with fixed foundations; floating offshore wind energy; tidal and wave energy; marine biotechnology, seabed mining; and tourism and recreation, based on depth and distance from the shore. This is an important first step in developing a single source document for marine industry boundaries that will help marine spatial planners and researchers develop innovative industry combinations to foster growth in the marine sector.

Achieving sustainable exploitation of deep sea resources is challenged by the huge uncertainty around the many risks posed by human activities on these remote ecosystems and the goods and services they provide.We used a Delphi approach, an iterative expert-based survey process, to assess risks to ecosystem services in the North Atlantic Ocean from climate change (water temperature and ocean acidification), the blue economy (fishing, pollution, oil and gas activities, deep seabed mining, maritime and coastal tourism and blue biotechnology), and their cumulative effects. Ecosystem services from the deep sea identified through the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework were presented in an expert survey to assess the impacts of human drivers on these services. The results from this initial survey were analyzed and then presented in a second survey. The final results based on 55 expert responses indicated that pollution and temperature change each pose high risk to more than 28% of deep-sea ecosystem services whilst ocean acidification, and fisheries both pose high risk to more than 19% of the deep-sea ecosystem services. Services considered to be most at risk of being impacted by anthropogenic activities were biodiversity and habitat as supporting services, biodiversity as a cultural service, and fish and shellfish as provisioning services. Tourism and blue biotechnology were not seen to cause serious risk to any of the ecosystem services. The negative impacts from temperature change, ocean acidification, fishing, pollution, and oil and gas activities were deemed to be largely more probable than their positive impacts. These results expand our knowledge of how a broad set of deep-sea ecosystem services are impacted by human activities.

However, this new framing creates and calls for new understandings of how actors and places relate to one another, control, and create meaning and value. Thus, understanding the ocean-and its conceptual and material fabric-in this context, is a matter of political ecology, raising a number of questions that extend across geographies, spatio-temporalities, and political actors, both human and more-than-human. In this article, we flesh out these questions. An understanding of historical efforts to legally secure oceanic space can help contextualize the emergent African blue economy, one which we propose rests predominantly on the notion of 'security.' We demonstrate how resources are economically, environmentally, and politically 'secured' as they are first constructed as economic objects of accumulation, then militarized as matters of geopolitical security, and finally controlled through technologies of monitoring, surveillance, and resistance. The 'security' of the blue growth agenda and its effects operates across different temporal and spatial dimensions and are realized in different ways across the continent as explored in the six articles in this Special Section. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included ,  Basil  => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mining,neutral,Tier 1 (BE)",,Blue economy;Deep sea mining;Oceanic space;Political ecology;Security;Africa;ecological approach;economic growth;environmental economics;historical perspective;marine resource;politics;security;spatiotemporal analysis;sustainability,,,Securing the blue: Political ecologies of the blue economy in Africa,TITLE(,Securing the blue: Political ecologies of the blue economy in Africa,TITLE(Securing the blue: Political ecologies of the blue economy in Africa) OR,,,,,

This paper examines the development and implementation of marine spatial planning in Ireland, and considers its functionality in the face of climate change impacts. Climate change will cause significant changes in the availability and reliable delivery of marine ecosystem services, particularly supporting and regulating services. It is important for policy makers and stakeholders to recognise the limits of planning when faced with the uncertain, complex nature of climate change. As such, marine spatial planning tools must be responsive, adaptive, and support larger responses that address the sources of climate change – greenhouse gas emissions – rather than responding to its impacts. © 2019, Geographical Society of Ireland.

The marine environment is increasingly busy, changing, and a site of degradation, marginalization, injustice, contestation and conflict over declining resources and occupied spaces at local to global scales. Themes of political ecology, such as power and politics, narratives and knowledge, scale and history, environmental justice and equity, are thus salient issues to understand in ocean and coastal governance and management. This subject review examines research on these themes of political ecology in the ocean and coastal environment and reflects on how the insights gained might be applied to governance and management. Political ecology provides important insights into: the influence of power in ocean management and governance processes; the manner in which narratives, knowledge, and scale are used to legitimize and shape policies and management efforts; the effects of historical trajectories on present circumstances, options, and practices; and the nature of inequities and environmental injustices that can occur in the marine environment. Moreover, ocean and coastal researchers, practitioners, and decision makers ought to engage with the political processes and injustices occurring in the ocean.

Attention shifts to examine current directions and challenges of unfolding planning for the expanded development of coastal and marine tourism in South Africa. It is shown that uneven spatial development characterises the existing coastal tourism economy. Arguably, tourism planning is linked to Operation Phakisa which is being challenged for a number of shortcomings, most importantly for prioritising investment attraction and economic growth stimulation over issues about the conservation of maritime resources. © 2019 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia.

Recently maritime spatial planning (MSP) is gaining attention as a new approach to sustainable marine resource management by integrating economic, environmental and social concerns is same management platform. In many countries, MSP has been proved as an effective tool to implement ecosystem based approach of planning to achieve long term maritime vision. Bangladesh, with growing economic interest on coastal and marine resources, is looking to adopt best strategies for achieving blue economy goals. However, degrading ocean health due to anthropogenic pressure and impact of climate change are major challenges that need to be faced.

The complexity of ocean systems, combined with limitations on data and capacity, demands an approach to management that is pragmatic—meaning goal- and solution-oriented, realistic, and practical. This article proposes and discusses five rules of thumb upon which to build such an approach. 1) Define objectives, quantify tradeoffs, and strive for efficiency. Understanding stakeholders’ objectives, and the nature of tradeoffs between them, keeps management goal-oriented, aware of its full range of options, and maximizes the likelihood of finding win-win solutions. 2) The data you have can do more than you think. Cross-system similarity, within-system complexity, and general first principles all add informational value to data collected both within and outside the system being managed. 3) Engage stakeholders, but do it right. Co-management and citizen science can be important tools in the science and management toolbox, especially in data- and capacity-limited regions. 4) Measure your impact and learn as you go. This can increase short-term start-up costs but can prevent larger wastes of resources in the long-term. 5) Design institutions, not behaviors. Management does not directly control fishing efforts, pollution rates or other behaviors, but instead controls institutions under which stakeholders make choices. Each of these rules of thumb is inspired by real-world successes and case studies. Concrete examples are used to illustrate key concepts, with the aim of providing a digestible set of guidelines that any manager can follow. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 67 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.005,Blue economy;Blue growth;Ecosystem-based fishery management;economic growth;ecosystem management;fishery management;fishing effort;stakeholder,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.005,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.005,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.005) OR,,,,,

Analyzing the philosophical crisis, the book comes to the conclusion that the world may need a “new enlightenment”; one that is not based solely on doctrine, but instead addresses a balance between humans and nature, as well as a balance between markets and the state, and the short versus long term. To do this we need to leave behind working in ”silos” in favor of a more systemic approach that will require us to rethink the organization of science and education. However, we have to act now; the world cannot wait until 7.6 billion people have struggled to reach a new enlightenment.

As a result of international initiatives and growing awareness of the need to address environmental concerns, such states are being encouraged to enact legislation to protect the environment and promote sustainable futures. In the Pacific region this future is increasingly linked to the “blue-green” economy: development that builds on the terrestrial and marine resources of Pacific island states. At the same time, internationally, there is an emerging acknowledgment of the value of traditional, indigenous and localised management of these resources. In the Pacific customary law is just one source of law in plural legal systems. The challenge then is how to develop environmental law which capitalises on the strength of plural approaches, promotes a “blue-green economy” and meets the international and regional expectations of commitment to environmental protection?

This paper will explore the co-evolution and co-dependence of Blue Economy and maritime security agendas, with a particular focus on the IOR. It identifies two primary interactions between Blue Economy and maritime security interests. Firstly, maritime security is an enabler of the Blue Economy, for example, through safeguarding navigation routes, providing important oceanographic data to marine industries and protecting rights over valuable marine resources and activities within claimed zones of maritime jurisdiction. Secondly, an often overlooked role that maritime security plays in the Blue Economy is by being itself a source of economic development and growth. An expanded Blue Economy will create greater demand for maritime security capabilities, and this, in turn, will trigger increased investment and growth in these capabilities.

First, negotiations for any agreement will contend with the long-standing concept that the oceans are reserved for peaceful purposes. The maritime powers will insist that the concept, which reflects customary law and the practice of virtually all states, does not demilitarize the oceans. Second, any BBNJ treaty must overcome two interrelated spatial issues: the geographic parameters of what constitutes areas beyond national jurisdiction when those maritime boundaries are often uncertain, and how measures to protect the environment interact with military activities in those areas. Naval powers will insist that requisite marine protected areas (MPAs) and associated protective measures do not diminish naval freedom of navigation and other military uses of the sea. Third, BBNJ negotiations will be compelled to address how a new treaty will relate to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a host of other treaties, and customary norms. Imperfect as the contemporary global order of the oceans is, major maritime powers and even middle powers will seek to protect it and resist efforts at radical change that may destabilize existing regimes in pursuit of an ephemeral gain for BBNJ. This strategic interest in international stability, while understandable, unintentionally creates inertia that is likely to frustrate the most progressive proponents of BBNJ. Fourth, more broadly, any treaty is likely to affect marine ecosystem services and perhaps marine genetic resources (MGR), which help propel the blue economy and undergird national security. We may expect most coastal states to continue to jealously protect their exclusive rights to the living and nonliving resources offshore, and even to propose expansion of those rights and jurisdiction to adjacent areas. The most developed states, for their part, are unlikely to agree to any text that diminishes their rights to intellectual property related to marine biotechnology, which is a strategic sector for bio-weapons research and defense. In short, states with advanced military capabilities, and major maritime powers in particular, are unlikely to support more than incremental change to the regimes reflected in UNCLOS.

Marine industrial parks have gained substantial attention from domestic and foreign investors and governments at all levels; in particular, these parks are an essential part of the national blue economy development plan of the Chinese government. The carrying capacity of a marine industrial park is important to all related stakeholders. In this study, an evaluation system was established based on the literature review and expert interviews by using 32 indices under three dimensions (pressure, bearing, and transformation) to determine the carrying capacity of a marine industrial park. The carrying capacity of marine industrial parks in Shandong Province was evaluated using this system across diverse dimensions by incorporating state space and analytic hierarchy processes. Results indicated that carrying capacity significantly differed among regions, parks, and specific dimensions. Comparison among different types of marine industrial parks indicated that the modern marine service industry and fishery industrial parks showed improved and efficient development with relatively high bearing rates. By contrast, the modern marine manufacturing industry and strategic emerging industrial parks were significantly underdeveloped. This study proposes academic approaches and practical implications for the involved governments and managing committees. Furthermore, suggestions on park planning, policy support, industrial cluster, and industry–university–research institute alliances are provided to the government and enterprise perspectives to increase the carrying capacity of marine characteristic industrial parks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Others,neutral,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.013,Carrying capacity;Index system;Marine industrial park;State space approach;China;Shandong;analytical hierarchy process;index method;industrial agglomeration;industrial development;numerical model;Military Personnel,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.013,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.013,DOI(10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.013) OR,,,,,

In the present study, an operational wave forecasting system for the east coast of India is proposed using unstructured Simulating WAves Nearshore model (UNSWAN). This modelling system uses very high resolution mesh near the Indian east coast and coarse resolution offshore, and thus avoids the necessity of nesting with a global wave model. The model is forced with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) winds and simulates wave parameters and wave spectra for the next 3 days. The spatial pictures of satellite data overlaid on simulated wave height show that the model is capable of simulating the significant wave heights and their gradients realistically. Spectral validation has been done using the available data to prove the reliability of the model. To further evaluate the model performance, the wave forecast for the entire year 2014 is evaluated against buoy measurements over the region at 4 waverider buoy locations. Seasonal analysis of significant wave height (Hs) at the four locations showed that the correlation between the modelled and observed was the highest (in the range 0.78–0.96) during the post-monsoon season. The variability of Hs was also the highest during this season at all locations. The error statistics showed clear seasonal and geographical location dependence. The root mean square error at Visakhapatnam was the same (0.25) for all seasons, but it was the smallest for pre-monsoon season (0.12 m and 0.17 m) for Puducherry and Gopalpur. The wind sea component showed higher variability compared to the corresponding swell component in all locations and for all seasons. The variability was picked by the model to a reasonable level in most of the cases. The results of statistical analysis show that the modelling system is suitable for use in the operational scenario. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Excluded },10.1016/j.ecss.2017.12.010,Operational;Spectra;SWAN;Unstructured;Wave rider;Wave-forecast;Andhra Pradesh;Gopalpur;India;Odisha;Visakhapatnam;buoy system;model validation;nearshore environment;operations technology;satellite data;significant wave height;wave field;wave spectrum;weather forecasting;Middle East;Far East,,,10.1016/j.ecss.2017.12.010,DOI(,,,,,,,

In spite of the noted potential risks these debris posed to both the environment and humans, the scientific community paid little attention to then raised alarms. Recently, however, there has been an increasing interest by both the general public and the scientific community in the contamination and pollution of the marine environment by micro- and nanoplastic particles. Due to their physical and chemical characteristics, these pervasive contaminants can be found across the Globe and are distributed across the water column and have been shown to be ingested by numerous organisms. Although generally considered biochemically inert, such materials can adsorb other chemical substances, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), hence potentially leading to bioaccumulation and bioamplification phenomena. However, despite this recognized harmfulness, and although microplastics are a recognized threat to the “Blue Economy”, there are still multiple research gaps that should be adequately addressed, in order to obtain a realistic assessment of their prevalence in the environment. Additionally, despite the numerous national, regional and international regulatory instruments aiming at reducing the contamination by plastic litter, these appear to have been, so far, insufficient for reaching their proposed goal.

Recent studies on Maritime Spatial Planning and Blue Growth and economy reveal the significance of maritime transport both in socioeconomic and environmental terms. The objective of the present paper is to estimate the importance of maritime transport for the economy, society and environment of the region and assess the legal and policy framework under which maritime transport is developed and regulated. The analysis focuses on the Adriatic-Ionian Region (AIR). The paper builds upon existing policy and value estimation methodologies in order to develop an integrated assessment tool which can lead to a comparative evaluation of maritime transport against other drivers of the region. The effectiveness of the policy and legal framework in addressing the needs of maritime transport is then analyzed and assessed through the use of specific indicators. The integrated socio-economic and environmental analysis revealed that maritime transport is the second most important factor of change in the AIR following coastal and maritime tourism. Additionally, the analysis of the legal and policy framework led to the conclusion that a more effective integration of planning and strategic documents should be achieved. Maritime transport has often been addressed by important policy initiatives such as the European Union Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region (EUSAIR) and the Barcelona Convention for the protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal region of the Mediterranean.

Unfortunately, it is shown from PPU region statistics data that decreasing fisheries production in PPU region was occur especially for land fisheries from 2013 until 2015. The aim of this study is to formulate development strategies of Minapolitan in PPU Region by the Blue Economy concept. Several variables such as fisheries and aquaculture aspects, processing and marketing, incomes and workers, also sustainability and economic paradigm is evaluated in this study. Firstly it needs to identify the potential of character and problem by reviewing Minapolitan area in PPU Region with descriptive comparative analysis. Secondly, the fruitfulness of Minapolitan activity in PPU Region impact factors was identified by using internal and external factor (IFAS and EFAS) analysis. Then some of strategic considerations was formulated by using the successful development indicator in Minapolitan area that associate to the Blue Economy concept with SWOT analysis. The result of IFAS analysis show the highest score of strength that is production and commodity productivity. Contrarily, the income level factor is become the highest score at weakness. Then, the EFAS analysis declare that marketing system is the highest factor in opportunity. The position of SWOT quadrant indicate that the Minapolitan area of PPU region is in quadrant I /or first quadrant which means progressive. Therefore, the Minapolitan in PPU have a great chance to increase the cultivation optimally. The results of SWOT matrix is to increase its product and productivity by upgrading the quality and quantity production facilities, raising the control of production activites and also increasing the supervision of processing business with sustainable management business principle. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,aquaculture,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1088/1755-1315/70/1/012043,Aquaculture;Commerce;Factor analysis;Fisheries;Marketing;Productivity;Sustainable development;Business principles;Comparative analysis;Development strategies;Internal and external factors;Production facility;Region development;Strategic considerations;Sustainable management;Quality control,,,10.1088/1755-1315/70/1/012043,DOI(,10.1088/1755-1315/70/1/012043,DOI(10.1088/1755-1315/70/1/012043) OR,,,,,

The cases illustrate an imbalance in attention paid to key components of the Blue Economy and missed opportunities for integration across scales, time and stakeholders with a few noteworthy exceptions. Issues of power, agency and gender remain weakly addressed even in the most recent initiatives. While clearly defining components of the Blue Economy provides a valuable tool for assessing coverage of key elements of sustainable ocean management, it is less obvious that the new label, Blue Economy, significantly advances practice beyond existing sustainable development frameworks.

This article explores what the Blue Economy moment is and how geographers can engage with it. It acknowledges recent efforts by geographers to understand Blue Economy but goes further by outlining the European Union’s Blue Economy programmes and by discussing these in relation to recent agenda setting in marine science. We argue that in spite of apparent convergence on this goal, the Blue Economy imaginary disciplines disparate knowledge for economic projects, when the planetary reality is that every economic project is axiomatically a biological project, with some economic aspects. In this context, the article outlines how assemblage thinking could be relevant to a human geography engagement with Blue Economy and what this could like, and how a relational conception of Blue Economy helps advance understanding. Finally, we discuss the difficulties and potential for human geographers to be genuinely enactive given the disciplinary framings that have already been assumed or imposed through Blue Economy. This last is highlighted by discussing engagement in a particular New Zealand Blue Economy initiative. Rather than either promoting or critiquing Blue Economy, we encourage informed and critical engagement with Blue Economy by geographers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 102 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1177/2043820617691643,assemblage;bioeconomic;Blue Economy;coast;European Union;fisheries;human geography;marine environment;New Zealand;ocean;convergence;economic activity;fishery management;globalization;Military Personnel,,,10.1177/2043820617691643,DOI(,10.1177/2043820617691643,DOI(10.1177/2043820617691643) OR,,,,,

Several studies have criticised the navies for being ineffective and stumbling in their fight against pirates and in their engagement with local communities. Somali sentiments are reportedly coloured by considerable scepticism towards the international naval effort, not least due to a feeling of double standards towards foreign trawlers seen plundering the country's resources. This study investigates the naval–coastal nexus along the Somali coast by drawing on field research off- and onshore. It finds that anti-piracy forces’ presence have had a considerable impact on the decline in piracy. Moreover, naval–coastal engagement and cooperation run deeper than is commonly perceived. While grievances against illegal fishing are widespread, examination of the fishing sector reveals a significant amount of predation committed by local stakeholders. Competition for fishing sector rents, particularly over distribution of licences, occurs on the local, regional and national levels. Bonds between some pirates, smugglers and officials threaten coastal community development and undermine their security. This study concludes that Somalia's maritime predatory trap can only be broken when former pirate villages are engaged as equal partners in the regional blue economy. © 2015 Indian Ocean Research Group.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: Shipping,positive,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1080/19480881.2015.1090157,IUU fishing;maritime predation;Piracy;Somalia;Western Indian Ocean;Prednisolone,,,10.1080/19480881.2015.1090157,DOI(,10.1080/19480881.2015.1090157,DOI(10.1080/19480881.2015.1090157) OR,,,,,

rayyan-1032991225,Events and the blue economy: Sailing events as alternative pathways for tourism futures – the case of Malta,2018,,,International Journal of Event and Festival Management,,9,2,204-222,"Jones, A. and Navarro, C.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049127411&doi=10.1108%2fIJEFM-09-2017-0055&partnerID=40&md5=3abccd0c01a34af2392f7ebd1f39322d,,,,"Purpose: The Rolex Middlesea sailing event takes place in Malta on an annual basis. The race forms part of a number of new tourism initiatives supported by the Maltese Government. These aim to diversify the Maltese tourism economy from reliance on mass tourism to more niche or specialist forms based, for example, upon the “Blue Economy”. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the impact and future of sailing events using the Rolex Middlesea sailing event as a specific case. In turn it evaluates current and future contributions to both the Maltese tourist economy and broader experiences and lessons of such events for other regional destinations. Consideration is given to the overall impact of the Rolex race for Maltese tourism; how the event can be improved to enhance its contribution to Maltese tourism; and what challenges the event faces in promoting Malta as an “alternative” tourism destination. Conclusions assess the benefits and barriers for developing maritime events and for sailing and yachting sectors as an alternative tourism option for Malta. In turn, it provides a specific and unique case that reviews implications for such events and, at a broader policy context, lessons for developing niche event markets for tourism destinations generally. Design/methodology/approach: This research focusses upon an inductive approach using qualitative and case study research methodologies. Secondary data for events management, sports tourism sailing and yachting and niche market development provide a contextual framework. Primary research is used to collect qualitative data which are based on purposeful sample selection of interviews from professionals associated with Maltese maritime industries and key stakeholder groups. The data are analysed through discourse analysis techniques utilising grid matrices to evaluate and ascertain common themes and responses that occur from the discussions and questions asked. Findings: Results point to lessons learnt and future policy directions for the Blue economy and sailing and yachting as drivers for change. Results show that the RMSR can clearly create opportunities for the establishment of new innovative tourism markets. In turn, it is also recognised that this can lead to a stronger sailing and yachting tourism industry not only within Malta but also help regenerate or sustain interest in maritime traditions and stimulate new opportunities for maritime tourism and broader opportunities for the growth of the “blue economy” agenda across the region and further afield. Research limitations/implications: This single case study can be best described as an “exploratory” study. It deals with how an event is structured, functions and performs particularly within the different inter-organisational partnerships. In this context, the research deals with the case study of a real-life event and therefore its academic value may tend to be rather specific and industry focussed. The empirical value of the enquiry, nonetheless, can provide a platform to draw more general assertions regarding the hosting of sailing and yachting events and consequences more broadly for events management theory and practice. Practical implications: Evidence from the research also suggests that sailing and yachting has the capability of lending itself to many different areas of investment and new business development opportunities such as overwintering for yachts and corporate business event sponsorships linked to a growing MICE market. The need to engage with local communities at a local level is also recognised as a potential for building recognition and skill capacity. This, in turn, can assist local host communities to familiarise themselves with the discipline of sailing as a life skill simultaneously strengthening and encouraging maritime tradition and opening opportunities for social development, business and employment growth. Social implications: The RMSR demonstrates that such an event can assist local host communities to familiarise themselves with the discipline of sailing as a life skill simultaneously strengthening and encouraging maritime tradition and opening opportunities for social development, business and employment growth. The growth potential of the RMSR is thus broad and, in many ways, may continue to assist Malta in diversifying its traditional tourism markets, capitalising assets, developing opportunity for its local communities, encouraging business opportunity and assisting in developing a higher quality tourism focus for the Islands. Originality/value: Detailed and insightful research on sailing and yachting in Malta remains fairly limited and there is little hard evidence to prove the value of such events since there is little available data on differential spending patterns and little cost/benefit analysis undertaken. The RMSR case provide unique research which sets out to explore the role of the RMSR to Malta’s tourism product, identify and evaluate factors for success, evaluate key contemporary issues and challenges in hosting the event, evaluate the future potential of such events for Malta’s tourism economy and draw broader benefits and lessons for hosting events of this nature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,tourism",10.1108/IJEFM-09-2017-0055,Blue economy;Events;Malta;Maritime tourism;Rolex;Sailing-yachting,,,10.1108/IJEFM-09-2017-0055,DOI(,10.1108/IJEFM-09-2017-0055,DOI(10.1108/IJEFM-09-2017-0055) OR,,,,,

In this commentary, I focus on three key areas: (1) the ontological separation of land and sea and the conceptualization of ‘marine space’; (2) the ‘liveliness’ of oceans; and (3) practical possibilities for Blue Economy policies to draw on and engage with ‘wet ontologies’.

In the Indian Ocean region, island states have increasingly recognized this situation by placing greater emphasis on ocean policy and the opportunities the maritime domain offers.

In doing so, three fundamental propositions are made: First, the prospects for blue economy in Southeast Asia remain optimistic despite difficulties in collective action posed by the “ASEAN Way”, an obstacle which appears to have been considerably overcome in the launching of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015. Second, Indonesia’s growing economic and political profile allows it to assert the reins of regional (and even global) leadership on blue economy, without necessarily limiting itself to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) means and mechanisms. Third, while traditional security issues, both between Southeast Asian and extra-regional powers and within Southeast Asia over outstanding sovereignty and jurisdictional disputes, may impede cooperation on tackling non-traditional (maritime) security issues in the region, they may not prove as formidable an impediment against the successful realisation of blue economy initiatives. © 2016 National Maritime Foundation.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1080/09733159.2016.1244361,"ASEAN Economic Community (AEC);Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN);Blue economy;Indonesia;Non-traditional security;Southeast Asia;Asia, Southeastern;Southeastern United States",,,10.1080/09733159.2016.1244361,DOI(,10.1080/09733159.2016.1244361,DOI(10.1080/09733159.2016.1244361) OR,,,,,

In addition to the conventional MF/HF/VHF bands, there has been increasing interests in the utilization of higher frequency bands to provide broadband data service to the sea area. To design efficient maritime communication systems, the first and a fundamental requirement is to develop a framework to understand the wireless channels. In an integrated air-ground-sea communications network, there are two major type of channels to be investigated, namely the air-to-sea channel (e.g., for communication links from the aircraft-based base stations or relays) and the near-sea-surface channel (for land-to-ship/ship-to-land or ship-to-ship communications). Due to the unique features of the maritime propagation environment such as sparse scattering, sea wave movement, and the ducting effect over the sea surface, the modeling of these maritime channel links differs from conventional terrestrial wireless channels in many aspects and, consequently, will result in significant impact on the transceiver design. In this survey, we highlight the most notable differences from the modeling perspective as well as the channel characteristics for the air-to-sea and near-sea-surface channel links, with more focus on the latter. After a thorough review of existing modeling approaches and measurement campaigns, we conclude that the sparse and the location-dependent properties constitute the most important and distinctive characteristics of the maritime wireless channels.

The health of the human race and the sea are inextricably intertwined: around half of the oxygen we breathe is produced by marine plants and phytoplankton; the seas account for 71% of our planet’s surface and contain 97% of our planet’s water. According to the European Commission’s EU Blue Growth programme (2012), the ‘blue’ economy represents 5.4 million jobs and generates a gross added value of almost €500 billion a year, with further growth possible. In Europe, the fishing industry employed 141,110 full-time equivalent jobs in 2011, had a fishing fleet of 84,909 vessels with a total gross tonnage of 1.8 million tonnes, and had an overall production value of around €23 billion (Joyce 2012). Furthermore, the ocean provides a whole range of services that are important for human safety and health. 330In the words of the European Marine Board (2013: 4), “the marine environment contributes significantly to human health through the provision and quality of the air that we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink and in offering health-enhancing economic and recreational opportunities”.

But the concomitant risk of intensified resource extraction to migratory species is worrying given these species contribute to important ecological processes, often underpin alternative livelihoods, and are mostly already threatened. We thus sought to quantify the potential conflict between key economic activities (5 fisheries and hydrocarbon exploitation) and sea turtle migration corridors in a region with rapid economic development: southern and eastern Africa. We satellite tracked the movement of 20 loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and 14 leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles during their postnesting migrations. We used movement-based kernel density estimation to identify migration corridors for each species. We overlaid these corridors on maps of the distribution and intensity of economic activities, quantified the extent of overlap and threat posed by each activity on each species, and compared the effects of activities. These results were compared with annual bycatch rates in the respective fisheries. Both species’ 3 corridors overlapped most with longline fishing, but the effect was worse for leatherbacks: their bycatch rates of approximately 1500/year were substantial relative to the regional population size of <100 nesting females/annum. This bycatch rate is likely slowing population growth. Artisanal fisheries may be of greater concern for loggerheads than for leatherbacks, but the population appears to be withstanding the high bycatch rates because it is increasing exponentially. The hydrocarbon industry currently has a moderately low impact on both species, but mining in key areas (e.g., Southern Mozambique) may undermine >50 years of conservation, potentially affecting >80% of loggerheads, 33% of the (critically endangered) leatherbacks, and their nesting beaches. We support establishing blue economies (i.e., generating wealth from the ocean), but oceans need to be carefully zoned and responsibly managed in both space and time to achieve economic (resource extraction), ecological (conservation, maintenance of processes), and social (maintenance of alternative livelihood opportunities, alleviate poverty) objectives. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Xiaoyu => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,fisheries,non-targeted",10.1111/cobi.12992,"biologging;fisheries;hydrocarbon;longlining;marine spatial planning;migratory or wide-ranging species;sea turtles;Africa, Eastern;Animal Migration;Animals;Conservation of Natural Resources;Endangered Species;Female;Mozambique;Oceans and Seas;Turtles;Caretta caretta;Cheloniidae;Dermochelys coriacea;Testudines;artisanal fishery;beach;bycatch;economic activity;economic development;endangered species;livelihood;marine ecosystem;migratory species;nesting;population growth;resource use;risk assessment;spatial planning;turtle;Africa;animal;environmental protection;female;population migration;sea;Military Personnel",,,10.1111/cobi.12992,DOI(,10.1111/cobi.12992,DOI(10.1111/cobi.12992) OR,,,,,

We assess the value chain for nearshore Hawaiian coral reef fisheries, mapping post-catch distribution and disposition, and quantifying associated monetary, food security, and cultural values. We estimate that the total annual value of the nearshore fishery in Hawai‘i is $10.3-$16.4 million, composed of non-commercial ($7.2-$12.9 million) and commercial ($2.97 million licensed + $148,500-$445,500 unlicensed) catch. Hawaii’s nearshore fisheries provide >7 million meals annually, with most (>5 million) from the non-commercial sector. Over a third (36%) of meals were planktivores, 26% piscivores, 21% primary consumers, and 18% secondary consumers. Only 62% of licensed commercial catch is accounted for in purchase reports, leaving 38% of landings unreported in sales. Value chains are complex, with major buyers for the commercial fishery including grocery stores (66%), retailers (19%), wholesalers (14%), and restaurants (<1%), who also trade and sell amongst themselves. The bulk of total nearshore catch (72–74%) follows a short value chain, with non-commercial fishers keeping catch for household consumption or community sharing. A small amount (~37,000kg) of reef fish—the equivalent of 1.8% of local catch—is imported annually into Hawai‘i, 23,000kg of which arrives as passenger luggage on commercial flights from Micronesia. Evidence of exports to the US mainland exists, but is unquantifiable given existing data. Hawaiian nearshore fisheries support fundamental cultural values including subsistence, activity, traditional knowledge, and social cohesion. These small-scale coral reef fisheries provide large-scale benefits to the economy, food security, and cultural practices of Hawai‘i, underscoring the need for sustainable management. This research highlights the value of information on the value chain for small-scale production systems, making the hidden economy of these fisheries visible and illuminating a range of conservation interventions applicable to Hawai‘i and beyond. © 2017 Grafeld et al.

In Canada, access to marine resources and ocean spaces is a significant issue for many coastal and Indigenous communities due to intensifying activity and competition in the marine environment. The general trend of loss of access has implications for these communities, and for Canadian society. In this review and policy perspective, we argue that access for coastal and Indigenous communities should be a priority consideration in all policies and decision-making processes related to fisheries and the ocean in Canada. This paper reviews how access affects the well-being of coastal communities, factors that support or undermine access, and research priorities to inform policy. Recommended actions include: ensuring access is transparently considered in all ocean-related decisions; supporting research to fill knowledge gaps on access to enable effective responses; making data accessible and including communities in decision-making that grants or restricts access to adjacent marine resources and spaces; ensuring updated laws, policies and planning processes explicitly incorporate access considerations; and, identifying and prioritizing actions to maintain and increase access. Taking action now could reverse the current trend and ensure that coastal and Indigenous communities thrive in the future. This is not just a Canadian issue.

Historically an industrial and natural resource powerhouse, the region has suffered economic stagnation in recent decades. Meanwhile, growing water resource scarcity around the world is creating pressure on water-intensive human activities. This situation creates the potential for the Great Lakes region to sustainably utilize its relative water wealth for economic benefit. We combine economic production and trade datasets with water consumption data and models of surface water depletion in the region. We find that, on average, the current economy does not create significant impacts on surface waters, but there is some risk that unregulated large water uses can create environmental flow impacts if they are developed in the wrong locations. Water uses drawing on deep groundwater or the Great Lakes themselves are unlikely to create a significant depletion, and discharge of groundwater withdrawals to surface waters offsets most surface water depletion. This relative abundance of surface water means that science-based management of large water uses to avoid accidentally creating “hotspots” is likely to be successful in avoiding future impacts, even if water use is significantly increased. Commercial water uses are the most productive, with thermoelectric, mining, and agricultural water uses in the lowest tier of water productivity. Surprisingly for such a water-abundant economy, the region is a net importer of water-derived goods and services. This, combined with the abundance of surface water, suggests that the region's water-based economy has room to grow in the 21st century. © 2016 The Authors.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",10.1002/2016EF000371,virtual water;Great Lakes Basin;discharge;human activity;resource depletion;resource economy;resource scarcity;sustainable development;trade relations;water management;water resource;water use,,,10.1002/2016EF000371,DOI(,10.1002/2016EF000371,DOI(10.1002/2016EF000371) OR,,,,,

Not only are the regional investment and the climatic risks included in the model, but also variables related to the anthropogenic pressure, such as population, economic activities and waste production. Feedback effects of economic and demographic expansion on the pollution of coastal areas are also considered. It is found that dangerous waste increases with growing shipping and transportation activities and with growing population density in non-touristic coastal areas. On the other hand, the amount of non-dangerous wastes increases with marine mining, defense and offshore energy production activities. However, lower waste production occurs in areas where aquaculture and touristic industry are more exploited, and accompanied by increasing regional investment in waste disposal. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 6 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: negative,non-targeted,Tier 2 (Applications)",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.08.025,"Blue economy;Regional growth;Scenarios;Simultaneous equation model;Aquaculture;Environmental Monitoring;Environmental Pollution;Humans;Industry;Models, Econometric;Refuse Disposal;Ships;Waste Products;Water Pollution;Coastal zones;Economics;Investments;Population statistics;Regional planning;waste;Anthropogenic pressures;Blue economies;Econometric model;Economic activities;Population densities;Simultaneous equation modeling;Waste production;econometrics;investment;numerical model;population growth;public spending;regional economy;waste disposal;aquaculture;energy yield;human;mining;population density;population model;seashore;shipping;analysis;environmental monitoring;industry;pollution;ship;statistical model;statistics and numerical data;water pollution;Waste disposal;Military Personnel",,,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.08.025,DOI(,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.08.025,DOI(10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.08.025) OR,,,,,

To collect data, consultations with different stakeholders related to Blue Growth in Bangladesh were conducted. Secondary data were collected from the review of policy documents, newspaper reports and scholarly articles. Coastal and marine resources i.e. living, non-living and renewable are identified as the main components of Blue Economy in Bangladesh. Moreover, trades and commerce related to the sea and coast, and protection from natural disasters also have economic returns having potential for enhancing Blue Growth. Conversely, sea level rise, climate-driven extreme events, pollution, human interferences and lack of law enforcement are identified as the major challenges for the further development of Blue Economy. To achieve sustainable Blue Growth in Bangladesh, a strategic planning is required which should focus on potential sectors related to Blue Economy, research and ocean governance.

Energy balance studies indicate that, in the 90% hydrate-saturated reservoir, the theoretical energy conversion ratio is 1:4.9, and for saturations below 20%, the ratio is <1. It is identified that a water flow of 0.2 m3/h at 270°C is required for every 1m2 of wellhead surface area to dissociate gas hydrates up to a distance of 2.6 m from the well bore within 36 h. © 2016, Marine Technology Society Inc.

Expanding populations, insecurity of traditional sources of supply and the effects of climate change add urgency to a perceived need to address and overcome the serious challenges of working in the maritime environment. Four promising areas of activity for 'Blue Growth' have been identified at European Union policy level including Aquaculture; Renewable Energy (offshore wind, wave and tide); Seabed Mining; and Blue Biotechnology. Work has started to raise the technological and investment readiness levels (TRLs and IRLs) of these prospective industries drawing on the experience of established maritime industries such as Offshore Oil and Gas; Shipping; Fisheries and Tourism. An accord has to be struck between policy makers and regulators on the one hand, anxious to direct research and business incentives in effective and efficient directions, and developers, investors and businesses on the other, anxious to reduce the risks of such potentially profitable but innovative investments. The EU H2020 MARIBE (Marine Investment for the Blue Economy) funded project was designed to identify the key technical and non-technical challenges facing maritime industries and to place them into the social and economic context of the coastal and ocean economy. MARIBE went on to examine with companies, real projects for the combination of marine industry sectors into multi-use platforms (MUPs). The purpose of this book is to publish the detailed analysis of each prospective and established maritime business sector. Sector experts working to a common template explain what these industries are, how they work, their prospects to create wealth and employment, and where they currently stand in terms of innovation, trends and their lifecycle. The book goes on to describe progress with the changing regulatory and planning regimes in the European Sea Basins including the Caribbean where there are significant European interests. The book includes: Experienced chapter authors from a truly multidisciplinary team of sector specialisms First extensive study to compare and contrast traditional Blue Economy with Blue Growth Complementary to EU and National policies for multi-use of maritime space. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.

However, capitalizing on these opportunities presents significant challenges and a multi-sectoral, integrated approach to managing marine socio-ecological systems will be required to achieve the full benefits projected for the blue economy. Integrated ecosystem assessments have been identified as the best means of delivering the information upon which marine resource management decisions can be made. By their nature, these assessments are inter-disciplinary, but to date have mostly focused on the natural sciences. Inclusion of human dimensions into integrated ecosystem assessments has been lagging, but is fundamental. Here we report on a Symposium, and the articles emmanating from it that are included in this Theme Set, that address how to more effectively include human dimensions into integrated ecosystem assessments. We provide an introduction to each of the main symposium topics (governance, scenarios, indicators, participatory processes, and case studies), highlight the works that emerged from the symposium, and identify key areas in which more work is required. There is still a long way to go before we see end-to-end integrated ecosystem assessments inclusive of all the major current and potential ocean use sectors that also encompass multiple aspects of human dimensions. Nonetheless, it is also clear that progress is being made and we are developing tools and approaches, including the human dimension, that can inform management and position us to take advantage of the multi-sectoral opportunities of sustainable blue growth. © 2017 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

To cover a more sustainable dimension, terms such as ‘blue economy’ and ‘blue growth’ have been coined, and are increasingly used in international contexts and academic literature. However, there are no generally accepted definitions of these ‘blue’ concepts. In particular, it is not clear what connotation of sustainability and what role of natural environment is linked to these terms. The objective of this study is to retrace the meaning of the concepts of blue economy and blue growth and include them in a coherent environmental accounting framework. Starting from the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting of the United Nations, a set of assumptions is proposed to link blue economy/growth and ecosystem services, including the creation of an adjusted measure of value added, while considering the depletion and degradation of the environment and the value of non-market benefits provided by the ecosystem.

Cage culture was found to be a male-dominated activity with the majority of owners aged <45 years (n = 23; 59%). Siaya County had the highest cage establishments (n = 20) and number (n = 1,343). Proximity to Dominion Farm, pioneers of cage culture, as well as decreased presence of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) coverage may have contributed to high cage numbers in Siaya County.

This study also examined how non-compliance with the legal framework could negatively affect government initiatives to achieve Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 14. To collect empirical data, fieldwork was conducted at two sites in the coastal zone of Bangladesh and was supplemented by a review of the secondary literature on legal documents. The key findings show that despite the strong existing legal mechanisms, non-compliance with regulations is widespread and has resulted in severe degradation of coastal and marine living resources. Thus, the unsustainable exploitation of resources is restricting the ability to achieve the targets of SDG 14, such as eliminating IUU fishing and providing access to small-scale fisheries.

Macroalgae have high potential for a wide range of applications, e.g. as source of pharmaceuticals, production of biofuels or as food and feed. However, data on the chemical composition of macroalgae from Norwegian waters are scant. This study was designed to characterize the chemical composition of 21 algal species. Both macro- and micronutrients were analysed. Concentrations of heavy metals and the metalloid arsenic in the algae were also quantified. RESULTS: The results confirm that marine macroalgae contain nutrients which are relevant for both human and animal nutrition, the concentrations whereof are highly dependent on species. Although heavy metals and arsenic were detected in the algae studied, concentrations were mostly below maximum allowed levels set by food and feed legislation in the EU. CONCLUSION: This study provides chemical data on a wide range of algal species covering the three taxonomic groups (brown, red and green algae) and discusses both benefits of and potential limitations to their use for food and feed purposes. © 2017 The Authors.

In this context, different institutional strategies and voluntary initiatives by coastal communities were implemented in order to better manage marine resources. According with blue economy and blue growth models, the European regulatory framework strongly affects the member countries through the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), underlining that economic growth of maritime activities cannot ignore the environmental and ecological aspects. In Italy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies (MiAFFP) carries out supplementary measures in order to improve the competitiveness of fisheries with three-year national plans. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ten Local Management Plans (LMPs) for fishing activities recently implemented in Sicily (Italy). Monitoring of fisheries activities for the period 2012-2015 by using biological, technical, economic and social indicators, had allowed to assess each plan. Data analysis had taken into account the polyvalence and diversification of fishing activities. Results show that the implementation process of the LMPs had been very complex at every stage. Despite the innovations and the availability of the fishing communities to a strict self-management, several critical issues and weakness in strategies have emerged. Arising considerations on institutional and social sustainability domains underscore the importance of the local management to ensure long-term sustainability of the resources exploited, through the increase of accountability in resource management shared between institutions, fishers and scientists. © 2017, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

It argues that such thinking directs attention in three novel directions: a re-categorisation of economy; new economic objects of concern; and to a potential politics of economic rent and social return. Actualised blue economies might be interpreted as entrepreneurial, investment and management initiatives that draw on marine environments to create economic and social values that sustain or enhance the resourcefulness of those environments and their communities.

With that in mind, we developed a new undergraduate course (called Ocean Observing) focused on conducting research by analyzing data collected and delivered to shore in near real time from the growing global network of ocean observatories. The course structure is based on student teams that use data to develop a range of data products, many of which have been suggested by state and federal agencies as well as from maritime companies. Students can take the Ocean Observing course repeatedly throughout their undergraduate career. A complimentary second entry course (called Oceanography House) was developed to entrain freshmen first-term students into research on their first semester on campus. The Ocean Observing course has increased the number of marine science majors and the overall diversity of the marine science program and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of independent student theses conducted each year. Over the last 10 years, student data profiles from the course emphasize the importance of conducting research in a public way so students can partake in the “adventure” of research before the outcome is known. To increase the public visibility of these “adventures,” collaborations between departments across the campus have developed nationally broadcast documentaries and outreach materials. Going forward, we seek to build on this success by developing an accelerated Masters of Operational Oceanography and link these undergraduate students with external companies through externships and coordinated research projects. © 2018, Marine Technology Society Inc.

The non-binding ""Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia"" (SDS-SEA), on the other hand, has forged stronger regional cooperation and partnership in undertaking regional implementation of the Plans of Action of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). A permanent regional mechanism has been established to continue the regional efforts over a much longer timeframe, as regional ocean governance not only requires time and resources but also the much needed regional leadership and visions.

Operation Phakisa's strong focus on maritime economic matters ignores two unresolved issues in respect of South Africa's maritime economy and maritime diplomacy, namely the country's extended continental shelf claim. If successful in its claim, South Africa's territory will increase significantly (thus a 10th province) and thus its security and economic opportunities and challenges. The latter includes the exploration and exploitation of extended shelf resources such as oil and gas, gas hydrates, seabed mining, and marine genetic resources. As very little legal precedent and state practice exists in respect of the actual delimitation of the extended continental shelf, South Africa's claims, which overlaps with that of its neighbours Mozambique and Namibia, could contributes to significant insecurity between these states.

The generator is directly coupled to a wind turbine, its output rectified and boosted to a desired DC voltage level, which supplies a DC-load directly. A bidirectional DC-DC converter links the DC-bus with a brushless DC (BLDC) motor, which finally turns a flywheel. A methodology for the sizing and design procedure of the individual components is presented next. The design approach incorporates a detailed discussion of three operation points of the WECSS, i.e. maximum wind speed, cut-in wind speed and absolute minimum wind speed at which the load demand is met.

Major actors have started to include maritime security in their mandate or reframed their work in such terms. Maritime security is a term that draws attention to new challenges and rallies support for tackling these. Yet, no international consensus over the definition of maritime security has emerged. Buzzwords allow for the international coordination of actions, in the absence of consensus. These, however, also face the constant risk that disagreements and political conflict are camouflaged. Since there are little prospects of defining maritime security once and for all, frameworks by which one can identify commonalities and disagreements are needed. This article proposes three of such frameworks. Maritime security can first be understood in a matrix of its relation to other concepts, such as marine safety, seapower, blue economy and resilience. Second, the securitization framework allows to study how maritime threats are made and which divergent political claims these entail in order to uncover political interests and divergent ideologies. Third, security practice theory enables the study of what actors actually do when they claim to enhance maritime security. Together these frameworks allow for the mapping of maritime security. © 2014 The Authors.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 166 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1016/j.marpol.2014.12.005,Concepts;Maritime security;Maritime threats;Securitization;Security practice;international relations;maritime boundary;political conflict;political ideology;regional security,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2014.12.005,DOI(,,,,,,,

Using the historical approach, the authors offer utilization coefficient of natural resources in the northern coastal area of Bulgaria. This ratio is in direct subordination to the duration of use of a given region and also duration and intensity of the impact of human factor and could help to create a map of areas with more or less exhausted natural resources along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.

The first inhabitants of North Bulgarian Black Sea coast and present city of Varna were representatives of a very old, over 10 000 years civilization. The report briefly discusses in chronological order the civilization periods in the history of the North Bulgarian Black Sea coast. A review of climate changes affected the living conditions in the coastal marine area was made. A rating of anthropogenic effects lead to changes in natural resources in different historical periods was made as well. The attention of authors is focused on the development of civilization processes driven by natural resources of the area. Attached are evidence and photographs. The authors present comparative figures. In conclusion the authors try to summarize the sensitivity of human development from nature factors and integrated coastal zone management indicators and the important role of Blue Economy for sustainable development. It is recommended to use interdisciplinary and complex approach to understand better the past and to create a successful scenario for the future development of the coastal zones and human society.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: positive,Tier 1 (BE),non-targeted",,Climate change;Natural resources;Regional planning;Sustainable development;Anthropogenic effects;Chronological order;Historical periods;Human development;Impact on the environment;Integrated coastal zone management;Integrated management;Living conditions;Coastal zones;Bulgaria,,,Historical approach to the implementation of Blue Economy in Bulgaria,TITLE(,Historical approach to the implementation of Blue Economy in Bulgaria,TITLE(Historical approach to the implementation of Blue Economy in Bulgaria) OR,,,,,

We are the stewards of the world's ocean, and it is our moral obligation and responsibility to pass on a healthy ocean to future generations and to ensure that ocean benefits can be enjoyed by humanity as a whole in an equitable manner. The ocean is essential to life and well-being. We need blue carbon to help store CO2 emissions. We need blue economies to benefit from the enormous and diverse opportunities offered by the marine environment - from tourism, transportation, fishing and recreation, to communication, scientific research, as well as the commercial applications of scientific findings in health and industry. We need the ocean also to support peaceful exchanges between countries which share trans-boundary waters and resources, and as a basis for scientific cooperation and global trade. In 2000, the world agreed on a set of visionary Millennium Development Goals, inspired by the lessons of the Declaration of Principles and Agenda 21, the Plan of Action of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Much progress has been achieved across the world, but this is insufficient and uneven. As countries accelerate towards the deadline of 2015, we must shape a new global sustainable development agenda, with the ocean at its heart. The stakes are high and time is against us. The climate system has already been significantly altered by human activities. During Earth's history, the ocean has ensured the planet's resilience against climate variability - it is still assisting us today, but there is a mismatch between the pace of human-driven carbon emissions and the ability of the ocean to respond to alterations of the climate system. The alarm bell is ringing - we must take immediate steps to allow the world ocean to continue acting as a life-support system. © UNESCO 2015.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1017/CBO9781316164624.001,Earth (planet);Marine applications;Marine communication;Sustainable development;Climate variability;Commercial applications;Declaration of Principles;Environment and development;Millennium development goals;Scientific cooperation;Scientific findings;Scientific researches;Oceanography,,,10.1017/CBO9781316164624.001,DOI(,,,,,,,

The article focusses on the US proposition to provide maritime security sector reform to African coastal states as a form of temporal strategy designed to shape new zoning practices in favour of freedom of movement. The paper concludes by arguing that the US strategy implies a policing approach that generates maritime surveillance capacities along land-sea lanes of communication.

Some recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a large number of picocyanobacterial strains, but their structural diversity (taxonomy) is still largely unknown.

Most of the current generation of biotech microorganisms can be conserved by lyophilization, or cryopreservation at ultra-low temperatures. Whilst lyophilized materials have a finite ""shelf-life"", cryopreservation can theoretically guarantee stability for 100's of years. Most of the organisms that are currently exploited biotechnologically originate from terrestrial niches; however, increased interest in finding alternative sources of new pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and oils, in particular, have stimulated much interest in exploring the marine environment. Uniquely in biotechnological exploitation, routine serial-transfer of algal cultures is accepted by many workers as the optimal method of long-term maintenance. Whilst there is limited published evidence of genotypic or functional instability, there are also examples of deleterious changes on prolonged maintenance including morphological changes and loss of metabolite production. Furthermore, there are risks, not only of loss of a valuable ""capability"", but of mislabelling, or even catastrophic failure of the master stock-cultures. These organisms, other previously unexplored taxa, and transgenic algae raise specific issues that necessitate appropriate targeted research, both on fundamental studies and in protocol development for materials with predicted biotechnological potential. © 2016, International Institute of Refrigeration.

Recent years have seen the discrediting of dollar diplomacy to secure recognition by both the Taiwanese voters and the OECD countries. It is also apparent that Taiwan cannot outspend the People’s Republic of China to secure diplomatic recognition. Taiwan cannot assume the current diplomatic truce with China will last, and must therefore use the current period of good relations with the PRC to rethink its full range of foreign engagements. Within the Pacific Islands, increasing emphasis is being placed on lessening dependence on aid and the price that goes along with this, and especially developing the blue (ie maritime) economy as Big Ocean nations rather than small island nations. This idea is particularly relevant to four of Taiwan’s six Pacific allies who are small population, big ocean Micronesian nations, as is neighbouring Tuvalu. All are also at the forefront of climate change with Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands the first to go underwater as archipelagos of atolls without high islands. Taiwan has competitive advantages in agriculture, green technology, and healthcare-all vital to its allies and all potentially politically neutral as health and environment issues with which it can further increase its contribution to multilateral development institutions. Taiwan’s engagement with Micronesia is a way to become seen as an increasingly global good citizen, especially in partnership with Japan and the USA, the two former colonial powers and largest aid donors to Micronesia and close allies of Taiwan. The small island nations of the Pacific are also potential stages to explore greater cooperation with the PRC in the future, but only if it is in true partnership with Pacific nations. © 2018, Tamkang University.

With this in mind we proposed a group of students and professors to consider building structures with an alternative material: bamboo, a material with which neither students nor professors had any experience in. During the course of this exercise the conceived structures developed from simple to complex designs, from required forms to free ones designed by the students, from small 1:100 scaled models to bigger 1:20 ones. Not theory but the practice itself generated a tremendous amount of enthusiasm within the group of students and within the group of professors. Knowledge of the stability of skeletal structures was gained in a playful way; theoretical thinking-errors were immediately tested by the practical execution of the newly developed model. The existence of alternative construction materials, in this case bamboo, the feel for the material and its numerous possibilities for construction purposes were being revealed!

We present a case study from the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) follow-on phase that elicited divers' and anglers' willingness to pay (WTP) for potential MPAs. The case study is an innovative combination of a travel-cost based choice experiment and an attribute-based contingent valuation method. Our study design allowed us to understand the marine users' preferences from both a user and a stewardship perspective. Following the UK NEA's place-based CES framework, we characterised marine CES as environmental spaces that might be protected, with features including the underwater seascape, and iconic and non-iconic species. Our survey highlighted the importance of CES to divers and anglers. A wide variety of marine spaces influenced user-WTP, while stewardship-WTP was most influenced by management restrictions, species protection, and attitudes towards marine conservation.

Furthermore, the Blue Economy wave was strengthen by the adoption of the 2050 Africa Integrated Maritime Strategy (AIMS). The impact on the trade and development agenda will be highlighted, followed by an overview of the governance structure and maritime economic strategies for the continent. South Africa as a regional and continental leader is also actively engaging by means of Operation Phakisa. This framework for planning and implementation of various marine related projects is made up by four priority sectors, namely: marine transport and manufacturing; offshore gas and oil exploration; aquaculture and marine protection services which includes ocean governance. These priority areas offer opportunities and challenges which requires further discussion as South Africa set sailing for economic growth and prosperity by tapping into the Blue Economy. Africa believes the benefits and potential rewards of maritime infrastructure developments followed by economic growth will be the turn of the tide for the continent.

The Great Lakes region benefits from and depends upon human choices and natural forces outside the region pushing and pulling it toward that balance. Choices within the basin are insufficient to maintain system resilience, and there is minimal government involvement in Great Lakes governance. The Great Lakes region perseveres like a pampered but powerless slave, contributing value but lacking liberty. The predominant drivers of change that have brought the basin to this perpetual knife's-edge existence of dependency are the global economy, societal values, and technological innovation. Climate change, energy, and demographics in turn drive those drivers on a global scale, but the region itself has evaded the most extreme climate-change impacts, which proved highly variable through space and time. Global changes in energy demand resulted in the most massive investment in green energy technology in planetary history, dramatically shifting the global demand for wind, solar, wave, and nuclear power. Coupled with aggressive pro-business North American policies and endemic private-sector intellectual capital, the Great Lakes region reemerged as an economic engine to serve the demand. This shift occurred despite the death of cooperative federalism and after decades of ideological politics gutted science-based, citizen-participatory regulatory structures. Governance at local scales remains highly variable, so the Great Lakes region rides on the coattails of past policies.

In Aotearoa New Zealand, some of the local indigenous peoples Maori are looking at green opportunities, primarily in renewable energy production. Some scholars suggest, however, that the Green Economy should be combined with a Blue Economy. The Blue Economy, as explained by Gunter Pauli 2010, is one which focuses on nature and encourages companies and entrepreneurs to mimic nature in their processes and in the creation of their products.

This article shows that the governance landscape at the regional sea level is very complex, fragmented and faced with several dilemmas. It examines the present governance structures in the four European seas (Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean Seas and North East Atlantic Ocean). It is argued that the implementation of EBMM at the regional sea level is characterized by a highly fragmented European governance system where there is lack of coordination between relevant DGs within the European Commission, between EU, International organisations, Regional Sea Conventions and the Member States and between sectoral governance arrangements that should provide sectoral management measures that support EBMM. The article develops suggestions for a nested governance system in which institutions, policies, laws and sectors are nested into a tiered, internally consistent and mutually re-enforcing planning and decision-making system. Developing institutional interaction and soft modes of governance between the EU, the Regional Sea Conventions, Member States and the governance arrangements of the different marine sectors will be crucial in evolving towards such a nested governance system for EBMM. Moreover, there is no one size fits all approach in implementing EBMM, which means that for each European Sea a context-dependent nested governance system should be developed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Excluded },10.1016/j.marpol.2014.03.007,Ecosystem-based marine management;Fragmented governance;MSFD;Nested governance;Regional cooperation;Soft modes of governance;Atlantic Ocean;Atlantic Ocean (Northeast);Baltic Sea;Black Sea;Mediterranean Sea;decision making;environmental protection;European Commission;European Union;governance approach;marine policy;Military Personnel;Ecosystem,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2014.03.007,DOI(,,,,,,,

An oil spill is an unwanted release of oil into ocean including accidents involving oil tankers or offshore platforms or oil pipelines. The advances in Space borne Remote Sensing and GIS along with communication systems have been helping the planners for oil spill monitoring aiding the blue economy. Some Regional systems / agencies in this arena are PROMED in Mediterranean seas, INSTOP in Canada, European Maritime Space Agency in Europe, ScanEx RDC for North Caspian Sea etc., providing near real time alerts to identify / locate the polluting vessels and initiate remedial actions. The increased maritime traffic has turned into a global economic and ecological concern. This calls for a global monitoring system. One of the proven paths in such requirements is to integrate all the existing systems along with developing regional / nodal systems for the less focused areas to provide seamless services. For India with a long coastline of 7500 Kms along and major oil installations along the coast line and growing maritime trade across major and minor ports; oil spill management is a major national requirement of the day. While Polarimetric SAR improved the oil spill monitoring to some extent, the availability of Hybrid Polarimetric SAR from India's Microwave SAR (RISAT-1) and Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) from Oceansat-2 from ISRO/India has expanded the scope for improving the efficiency of oil spill monitoring. In addition, India has proven experience in operational services through ISRO's ""Bhuvan / NICES"" GeoPortals and a dedicated centre for oceanic studies. Utilizing these strengths will help in augmenting operational services for Indian Maritime Zone along with scope for serving other regions of the world. Once such regional systems are operationalized, a global system can be configured on the lines of the International Charter for Disaster Management utilizing the strengths of the stake holders. Complimentary services like fusion of Optical and SAR data along with ground data can be employed to meet the near real time requirements to deliver 'right information' to the 'right people' in 'right time'. The paper will discuss the augmentation of the system for Indian Maritime Zone and will propose a Techno-Managerial Framework for the global scale operations which will pay rich dividends not only in economic saving but saving the mother planet.","Export Date: 03 July 2023; Cited By: 0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: { Marianne => Included } | RAYYAN-LABELS: neutral,Oil and gas,Tier 2 (Applications)",,GIS;Maritime Zone;Oil Spill;Remote Sensing;SAR images;Disaster prevention;Disasters;Geographic information systems;International trade;Monitoring;Offshore oil well production;Offshore pipelines;Oil spills;Oil tankers;Petroleum industry;Petroleum transportation;Polarimeters;Real time systems;Remote sensing;Space optics;Space-based radar;Synthetic aperture radar;Waterway transportation;Disaster management;International charters;Maritime zones;Ocean color monitors;Off shore platforms;Operational service;SAR Images;Spaceborne remote sensing;Marine pollution;India,,,Up-scaling regional oil spill management systems for global requirements: Needs and Contributions of India,TITLE(,Up-scaling regional oil spill management systems for global requirements: Needs and Contributions of India,TITLE(Up-scaling regional oil spill management systems for global requirements: Needs and Contributions of India) OR,,,,,
